Article:Did gold investing prices leap too far already in 2025...?


              
           


DID GOLD $3500 mark a big top for the safe-haven metal back in April? 
            asks Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             History says maybe. Investment professionals think so, too. 
           

              
           

             ""According to Bank of America's latest fund managers survey, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now.
           

              
           

             ""This,"" 
            explained Yahoo! in April, ""marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven [of giant US tech stocks] as Wall Street's most crowded trade.""
           

              
           

             Gold's over-crowding 
            then got worse in May, or so the 208 institutional fund managers replying to BoA's monthly survey said.
           

              
           

             A massive 58% of them labelled gold ""the most crowded trade""...!
           

              
           




              
           

             But really?
           

              
           

             Sure, physical gold investing has picked up in 2025.
           

              
           

             March and April 
            each brought BullionVault more first-time users than any month since New Year 2021. Most of them have chosen to buy gold first.
           

              
           

             But new account openings held a long way short of the genuine gold rush in 2020 or 2011, before 
            easing back in May and June so far...
           

              
           

             ...and while lots of retail coin-and-bar shops will tell you (via the more gullible end of the mainstream media) that they are flooded with demand, the torrent of secondhand coins and bars sold back to them has continued to match if not drown it.
           

              
           

             Secondly, yes. Some finance-industry products also saw demand rise. But only some, and only somewhat.
           

              
           

Gold-backed ETF trust funds worldwide, for instance, needed the most bullion at the start of May since way back in September 2022.
           

              
           

             But that quantity rose only 15% from the 4-year low hit a year ago, and trust funds listed in Europe grew less than 7%...
           

              
           

             ...before the global total then shrank for 3 weeks running this May.
           

              
           

             More telling still, speculative betting on US gold futures and options actually fell as the price raced up to April's new all-time highs. Because the hot money of hedge funds, CTAs and other 'Managed Money' traders has walked away from gold, not pushed in, so far in 2025.
           

              
           

             Over the 21 weeks since New Year's Eve, the price of gold has risen by 28%. Yet the size of the net spec long in Comex gold futures and options has shrunk by more than a third, dropping below its 10-year, 5-year and 3-year averages and defying its 
            previous but currently broken link with gold's price direction.
           

              
           

             So whatever ""crowd"" is buying and boosting gold, it doesn't work or trade in London, Frankfurt, Paris or New York. But that's hardly news. Because time and again since gold turned decisively higher in late 2023, the data and the facts on the ground point instead to 
            China's private gold-market flows, plus 
            'the rest vs. the West' among central banks and sovereign wealth.
           

              
           

             Are those two trades crowded? Maybe.
           

              
           

             ""The largest traders in SHFE Gold have 
            accumulated a new all-time-high position size,"" says commodity strategist Daniel Ghali at Canadian brokerage TD Securities. But there's no relationship BullionVault can find between the size of speculative betting in Shanghai futures and the direction of prices (contrasting with the way that US Comex bulls tend to track if not drive the price). And besides, as Ghali also notes, ""Chinese gold ETF flows remain muted"", 
            snapping the sharp rise (albeit from a very low base) seen earlier this year.
           

              
           

             Central banks, meantime, continue adding 
            gold to their official reserves as a group overall...
           

              
           

             ...but 
            at a slower pace as prices hit fresh record highs in April...
           

              
           

             ...led by 
            the long-time gold loving NBP of Poland, followed by the Czechs, Chinese and Turkey.
           

              
           

             Add in unofficial, unreported gold reserves demand however, and total central-bank purchases are set to top 1,000 for the 4th year running in 2025 on the forecast estimate from specialist analysts Metals Focus. That's a big number, the biggest since before World War 2 when first breached in 2022. But it's not accelerating, not in weight terms, on MF's analysis. So that crowd is now a longstanding (if cloaked) feature of the market.
           

              
           

             And anyway, are those the crowds which BoA's fund managers are talking about anyway?
           

              
           

             The BoA survey asks a daft question and gets a daft answer. What its respondents mean by ""crowded"" isn't defined. Nor is the market insight or intelligence which tells them what other investors are doing.
           

              
           

             Sure, there are many more bulls who are now much more vocal than there were six or 12 months ago, let alone 
            when gold was half today's price back in mid-2022.
           

              
           

             But simply scrolling through the headlines on your phone doesn't tell you anything about 
            what other investors are really doing with their money (or their clients' savings). Nor does it cut through the hype to show you whether 
            salesmen and promoters are making it up or not.
           

              
           

             Fact is, the very idea of trying to spot the ""most crowded trade"" is a psychological snake-pit writhing with bias, envy and FOMO...
           

              
           

             ...and BoA's question most likely reflects a) what an actual crowd doesn't currently own, and therefore b) which asset they want to believe has run too high, too fast, because they have missed out.
           

              
           

             And lo! Fund managers who don't own gold also think it's over-valued, too.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Usually, when you ask a bunch of investors whether something is under- or overvalued, and a bunch of them agree, the thing to do is run the other way,"" writes columnist Robert Armstrong at the 
            Financial Times, 
            also reviewing May's BoA survey.
           

              
           

             ""The interesting bit is that the last two times a lot of managers agreed that gold was overvalued, in 2020 and in 2011, they were right.
           

              
           

             ""Look at how gold performed subsequently (dark blue line). After 2011's fall, it took a decade for gold to retake its high in nominal terms.""
           

              
           

             Interesting, yes. But useful?
           

              
           

             If the BoA survey offers a guide to gold's future value, its 100% strike rate represents only 2-in-2 so far. That's nowhere near a pattern.
           

              
           

             More notably, the survey has also given two clear 'false positives' to date as well (early 2010, late 2024).
           

              
           

             So again, BoA's survey most likely says ways more about the psychology of fund managers than it does about gold's record price run of either 2011, 2020 or 2025 to date.
           

              
           

             As for the gold market itself, it's far from empty. But crowded with bulls it ain't.
           

              
           

             ""Nordnet fund savers bought global funds in May, dumped gold and silver,"" says a headline about the Swedish share-trading platform.
           

              
           

             ""Gold is out, equities are in,"" says a report from India quoting asset managers WhiteOak.
           

              
           

             ""Bitcoin ETFs pull in $9 billion as investors ditch gold holdings,"" adds Bloomberg, pointing to US trust-fund flows.
           

              
           

             Bottom line? Gold has jumped and lots of fund managers missed it. But that doesn't make it over-valued or crowded. And where the BoA survey may have value as a contrarian guide, it's 
            far more likely to shine a light on US equities and other rich-world stock markets rather than gold.
           

              
           

             Cos that's what the fund management crowd buys and sells.
           

              
           

             Glance at gold's price chart, meantime, and you can't miss the size and speed of this spring's surge. That might suggest $3500 marked an important, long-term high. Because gold has a nasty habit of setting big ugly tops.

2025-06-03,"Title:Gold Investing Trends Higher at Fresh Record Prices
Article:Underlying gold investment price tops new highs...


              
           


GOLD INVESTING sentiment continues to trend higher as the 'safe haven' precious metal sets fresh record prices, 
            says Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault.
           

              
           

             Gold in May swung as much as 10.8% below April's all-time high of $3500 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             But its month-average price rose for the 5th month in a row, gaining 2.2% to set a new record at $3278 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             Like gold's underlying price, Western gold investing sentiment also rose, with the Gold Investor Index also rose adding 0.7 points to 55.5 in May.
           

              
           

             That trend gave the highest reading on 
            BullionVault's unique measure of investors who chose to buy versus those choosing to sell since February's 28-month high of 56.3, and it pulled the Gold Investor Index's 12-month average up to 54.0, the strongest underlying level since August 2023.
           

              
           

             Back then, gold was trading at $1920 per ounce, almost two-fifths (41.4%) below last month's average price.
           

              
           




              
           

             By weight, investor profit-taking in gold was offset by demand in May.
           

              
           

             That contrasted with 
            April's heavy net liquidation of gold, and it kept the combined holdings of BullionVault users as a group virtually unchanged at 43.7 tonnes, now worth $4.6 billion (£3.4bn, €4.0bn).
           

              
           

             The number of new first-time investors eased back by one-third (37.4%) from April's 50-month high, but it held nearly two-thirds (62.8%) above May last year and it was more than one quarter greater (26.5%) than the past 5 years' monthly average, led by the UK (+32.7% from its 5-year monthly average), Germany (+40.3%), Spain (+66.5%) and Ireland (+70.2%).
           

              
           

             The United States, however, continued to show relatively weak new investor interest in precious metals, with the number of first-time BullionVault users dropping 44.6% last month from April's 48-month high, down 13.9% versus May 2024 and 16.4% beneath the past 5 years' monthly average.
           

              
           

             But the balance of US-resident gold buyers versus sellers on BullionVault rose for a second month running, taking the US-only Gold Investor Index up to 52.7, its highest in 2 years.
           

              
           

             So while US exceptionalism appears to extend to the need for portfolio insurance, sentiment towards the precious metal keeps trending higher, albeit from a lower base than among European investors.
           

              
           




              
           

             Silver's month-average price rallied 1.4% in May, rising back to $32.70 after the more industrially-useful precious metal dropped 2.8% from March's 12.5-year high of $33.18 per Troy ounce amid April's US tariff-policy chaos.
           

              
           

             In contrast to 
            April's heavy net buying of silver, demand for silver was matched almost exactly by investor selling last month, keeping BullionVault clients' combined holdings just above 1,160 tonnes with a value of $1.2 billion (£916m, €1.1bn).
           

              
           

             The Silver Investor Index, however, sank to 51.8, down 6.5 points from April's sudden 49-month high. This sharp retreat confirms that bargain-hunting drove April's spike. But as with the Gold Investor Index, sentiment keeps trending upwards, marking higher highs and higher lows as the industrially-useful precious metal's underlying price continues to rise.
           

              
           

             On a 12-month basis, silver prices rose in May above $31 per Troy ounce for the first time since New Year 2013.
           

              
           

             As for gold, its run of month-average gains has now made the strongest start to any year since 2006, matching the 5-month Covid Crisis run of April-to-August 2020 with the longest unbroken stretch of gains since the 8-month run ending in September 2011, the peak of gold's global financial crisis bullion market.
           

              
           

             So while the Trump White House is promoting crypto, the uncertainty and volatility spurred by the President's policies provide the perfect backdrop for fresh gains in gold, making it the best-performing asset of 2025 so far.
           

              
           

             That extends gold's market-beating returns across the 21st Century to date, confirming its appeal as a vital portfolio asset."
2025-05-29,"Title:Platinum Price 'Could Hit $1200' Amid 2025 Supply Deficit
Article:Platinum Week sentiment positive despite autocat decline...


              
           


The PRICE of PLATINUM could have further to run from this month's sudden 2-year highs according to leading analysts.
           

              
           

             But while new mine supply will again fail to match the size of demand 
            for the 3rd year running, platinum's market deficit will continue to be met by ample stockpiles of the industrial precious metal, capping its 2025 investment potential.
           

              
           

             ""The platinum market is expected to be in a deficit for a third consecutive year in 2025,"" says consultancy SFA (Oxford) in analysis published by precious metals refiners Heraeus.
           

              
           

             ""But this has not been reflected in the price...and plenty of stock remains available in 2025.""
           

              
           

             ""Platinum's benign long-term demand outlook will encourage investors to buy on dips,"" agrees specialist consultancy Metals Focus, also launching its latest market analysis last week, ""but plentiful inventory will cap the upside.""
           

              
           

             Still finding its largest single industrial use in autocatalysts to reduce harmful emissions from fossil-fuel engines, platinum peaked above $1100 per Troy ounce this Monday for the first time since May 2023 after jumping by 10.5% as mining executives, refiners, bankers, dealers, traders and analysts met for London Platinum Week.
           

              
           

             That beat the platinum price spike made during last year's event.
           

              
           

             ""China was a very good physical buyer at the platinum price around $950,"" Reuters quotes one precious metals trader, after new data said the world's No.1 manufacturing economy imported the most in a year last month, jumping by almost one-half from March's figure.
           

              
           

             ""The spike above $1000 will mute this demand.""
           

              
           

             Last week also saw hedge funds and other speculators trading Nymex platinum futures and options on the CME derivatives exchange turn bullish as a group for the first time since the start of April.
           

              
           




              
           

             Data starting in 2006 says that the Managed Money category was never net negative on platinum prior to the Dieselgate scandal which broke in September 2015, but those traders as a group have bet against the white precious metal 31.3% of the time since then.
           

              
           

             A court in Braunschweig, Germany this week sentenced two former executives at nearby automaker Volkswagen  to two and four years in prison respectively, and gave suspended sentences of more than a year to two other members of what the judge called a ""gang"" which cheated emission-testing systems.
           

              
           

             Shares in VW (ETR: VOW3) are now trading back down at the sudden lows hit in the 60% crash of 2015, when the Dieselgate scandal began hurting sales of diesel-engine passenger vehicles and hitting sentiment towards platinum, as did 
            the surge in sales of battery electric vehicles.
           

              
           

             The slew of new analyst forecasts published for Platinum Week all expect auto-sector demand for platinum and its sister palladium to decline once again in 2025.
           

              
           

             That's despite a slowdown in the sales growth of BEVs, for which production is expected to rise by less than 1/5th this year according to the mining industry's

             UK-based autocat and PGM refining specialist Johnson Matthey last week agreed the sale of its Catalyst Technologies (CT) business to Honeywell International for £1.8bn ($2.4bn). That news saw JM's share price (LON: JMAT) leap 30.7% to hit a 12-month high.
           

              
           

             Like JMAT, the share price of Belgian autocat and refining specialist Umicore (EBR: UMI) last month hit its lowest level since early 2009, down 87.6% from UMI's record high of mid-2021.
           

              
           

             Yet this month's Platinum Week found 
            sentiment ""a lot more positive"" towards the precious metal's outlook, says Adrian Hammond, executive director precious metals, oil and gas at South African brokerage SBG Securities. 
           

              
           

             ""I suspect that's because the vaults are a little bit emptier. [Manufacturers] have been through a phase of destocking,"" while 'primary' supply from new mine output as well as 'secondary' scrap are both ""quite weak"".
           

              
           


              Newly mined platinum output will fall 6% in 2025, the World Platinum Investment Council predicts, reversing more than twice the growth seen last year.
            

               
            


             ""We expect to see profit-taking near platinum's two-year high,"" Metals Focus says, ""prompting a price correction. But we do expect that the metal could rally as high as $1200."""

Article:$100 days make gold jumpier than stocks, too...


              
           


ANOTHER week, another slug of $100 days in the gold price, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Monday was $100 happier if you were buying...
           

              
           

             ...or $100 annoyed if you were selling...
           

              
           

             ...and with Wednesday coming close again, BullionVault users 
            keep doing plenty of both, just like they did last month.
           

              
           

             Silver also saw heavy trading in April, and 
            also because of big price swings.
           

              
           

             But while gold trading is still running strong, silver trading has eased back. And while historical data say that silver prices typically swing harder and faster than gold, that's not true right now.
           

              
           

             In fact, our analysis of the statistics shows that gold is now jumpier than silver by the widest margin since the 2001 terror attacks of 9/11.
           

              
           




              
           

             Volatility is the way that analysts measure how jumpy an asset's price is, or isn't.
           

              
           

             High is bad, low is good. Or so investment managers think. Short-term traders like it the other way around. Because quicker moves make for fast money, if you call it right.
           

              
           

             There's a number of ways to track volatility. Our statistics use the standard deviation maths (just like most such analysis does), crunching the size of the price swings for gold and silver, day-to-day, across every 21-day period (ie, one month of weekday trading).
           

              
           

             That number is then spat out as an annualized percentage...
           

              
           

             ...and the blue line in BullionVault's chart above simply tracks the difference between gold's rolling 1-month volatility and the rolling 1-month vol in silver.
           

              
           

             As you can see, gold is usually less volatile than silver. Much less volatile. 
           

              
           

             Over the past 6 decades in fact, gold has shown 16.2% volatility on average. For silver, the data averages out at 28.8%.
           

              
           

             This is why silver, famously, is known as ""the Devil's metal"". It's likely to jump or plunge far more often than gold...
           

              
           

             ...crushing any short-term traders who think they can guess which way it's going to swing next, most especially if they're betting with leverage through futures and options or CFDs and spreads rather than spot-market cash prices.
           

              
           

             But who's the Devil's metal now? Because over the past month, the price of gold has swung more violently than silver.
           

              
           

             That's rare. Since April 1968, when open-market gold prices were cut free from the Dollar's official value of $35 per Troy ounce, gold has been more volatile than silver less than 9% of the time. And over the past 2 decades, that statistic falls to just 1.1% of the time.
           

              
           

             Indeed, up until late last week, the Dollar-price data say that gold hadn't been more volatile than silver since mid-April 2022...
           

              
           

             ...immediate aftermath of Russia starting its 'special operation' to invade Ukraine.
           

              
           

             Back then, gold out-freaked silver by just 1.7 percentage points. Whereas this Monday, gold's 1-month volatility reached 12.0 percentage points above silver's if you track their London benchmark prices day-to-day.
           

              
           

             That means gold has been out-freaking the Devil's metal by the widest margin since late-September 2001...
           

              
           

             ...immediate aftermath of Al Qaeda's 9/11 atrocities on New York and the Pentagon.
           

              
           

             That terrible day coincided with gold prices finally finding their floor after a 2-decade bear market. (Lots of 
            other factors counted too, but it's 
            how history already likes to remember it.)
           

              
           

             Today, in contrast, gold has been soaring to fresh record highs, swinging lower only to set fresh record highs yet again, before swooning below $3200 this Wednesday.
           

              
           

             So has the past month's dramatic gold price action marked a blow-off top for the 'safe haven' metal?
           

              
           

             Maybe. But gold's sudden skittishness shouldn't spook investors out of the precious metal, not by itself.
           

              
           

             Compare gold to the stock market, for instance. Yes, gold is currently out-freaking the S&P500 index by a wide margin. Day-to-day over the past month, its volatility is a hefty 14.3 percentage points higher.
           

              
           

             But over the past 5 years, gold has been less volatile than that major US stock index almost 2/3rds of the time...
           

              
           

             ...only out-pacing the stock market's volatility 37.3% of the time on our analysis of London 3pm vs. the New York close.
           

              
           

             Silver, in contrast, has been more volatile than the S&P index nearly 9/10ths of the time (89.1% to be exact).
           

              
           

             So while gold's sudden freak-out might give some newer investors the jitters, it's got a long way to go...plus a whole heap of history to overcome too...before it gets anywhere close to matching the volatility of the stock market, never mind silver prices."

              Over the past 5 years, central banks as a group have chosen to buy almost 1 in every 8 ounces produced by global gold mining. Their demand outweighed inflows to gold-backed ETF investment products more than 5 times over.
            

               
            

              In fact, the total quantity of gold now reported to be held in national central-bank reserves – shown on BullionVault's interactive data table and map below – today accounts for 17% of all the gold ever mined in all of history.

 Top 10 countries by gold reserves 2025

              Gold continues to be a cornerstone of financial security for many nations in the 21st Century, especially in times of global uncertainty. Over the five years to 2025, central banks around the world have continued to bolster their bullion reserves as a hedge against inflation, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical instability.
            

               
            

              But which countries hold the most gold? Explore all the 
             gold reserves data in detail at the bottom of the page.
            










               
            
 USA

              Official data for the start of 2025 says that the United States continues to lead the global gold rankings with a massive 
             8,133.5 tonnes of gold held in reserve. Against its population of close to 
             340 million, this translates to an average of 
             23.9 grams of gold per person, worth almost $2200 per head at gold's early 2025 prices. Despite no change in reserve volume over the past five years, that per capita figure underscores the scale of America’s longstanding investment in gold as a strategic asset. The consistent volume also reflects the Federal Reserve’s conservative approach to its gold policy.
            

               
            
 Germany

              Germany’s gold reserves amount to 
             3,351.6 tonnes, maintaining its position as Europe’s top gold-holding nation. With a population of just over 
             83 million, this equates to an impressive 
             40.2 grams per person. This high per capita figure reflects Germany’s deep-rooted trust in gold as a store of value, managed by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Although the tonnage has dipped slightly from 2019, the country's commitment to gold remains firm.
            

               
            
 Italy

              Based on Italy’s official data for the end of 2024, its gold holdings stand firm at 
             2,451.9 tonnes, unchanged from five years earlier. With a population nearing 
             58.9 million, the country enjoys a strong 
             41.6 grams of gold per capita, one of the highest ratios in Europe. This consistent reserve level demonstrates Italy’s continued reliance on gold as a key component of its national financial security, overseen by the Banca d’Italia.
            

               
            
 France

              France holds a substantial 
             2,437.0 tonnes of gold, virtually unchanged from five years ago. With a national population approaching 
             64.8 million, this amounts to around 
             37.6 grams of gold per capita. Managed by the Banque de France, the country’s long-standing commitment to gold underscores its strategic role in safeguarding monetary stability, even as public interest in gold fluctuates.
            

               
            
 Russia

              Russia has, on its publicly stated data, boosted its gold holdings to 
             2,333.1 tonnes, reflecting a steady rise from its start-2020 level. With a population of approximately 
             144.4 million, this equates to 
             16.2 grams per capita. Though not the highest on the list, Russia’s strategic focus on increasing its reserves over time points to a broader effort to bolster economic independence and reduce exposure to foreign currencies.
            

               
            
 China

              China’s gold reserves grew significantly to 
             2,279.6 tonnes by the end of 2024, marking a continued upward trend in accumulation. However, with a vast population of over 
             1.42 billion, the country still only holds 
             1.6 grams of gold per person, one of the lowest per capita levels among major reserve holders. This disparity highlights the impact of population size on per capita figures, even when total reserves are high. But it might also be contradicted by the widespread view among gold-market analysts that Beijing is most likely growing its gold holdings faster than it reports in public, cutting its exposure to the Dollar and other US assets in favor of bullion.
            

               
            
 Switzerland

              Switzerland remains a global outlier when it comes to per capita gold, with 
             1,039.9 tonnes of gold reserves shared among just 
             8.8 million people. This results in an impressive 
             118.2 grams per person, by far the highest gold-per-head ratio in the world. Despite a referendum in 1999 voting to end the Franc's formal gold-backing in law, the Swiss National Bank’s commitment to maintaining large reserves of bullion reflects Switzerland’s historic role as a haven of financial security and independence.
            

               
            
 India

              India’s gold reserves rose significantly from 635.0 to 
             876.2 tonnes over the past half decade, a 38% increase in just five years. However, with a population of more than 
             1.43 billion, this results in just 
             0.6 grams of gold per person. While the per capita figure is small, the growth in reserves signals the Indian authorities' recognition of gold’s role in supporting national economic resilience and diversifying financial assets. That appeal is already well-known by India's private households, the 2nd largest buyers of the precious metal behind China's household sector.
            

               
            
 Japan

              Japan’s gold reserves increased to 
             846.0 tonnes by the end of 2024, up from 765.2 in 2019. With a population around 
             123.3 million, that gives the country a modest 
             6.9 grams of gold per capita. While not among the highest, this figure reflects Japan’s cautious and balanced approach to reserves management, with gold playing a supporting role alongside foreign currencies and other assets.
            

               
            
 Netherlands

              The Netherlands maintained its gold holdings at 
             612.5 tonnes as of New Year 2025, nudging the Central Bank of Turkey out of the Top 10 on BullionVault's analysis because, on its reported figures, Ankara counts a large portion of Turkey's commercial bank gold holdings among its sovereign reserves. With a population of about 
             17.6 million, the Netherlands shows a healthy 
             34.8 grams of gold per capita, placing it among Europe’s more robust gold-per-head nations. As with Switzerland, the consistency of its reserves reflects a long-standing national strategy focused on fiscal conservatism and stability.
            

               
            
 Who is buying the most gold among central banks and why?

              At the start of the 21st Century, all of the Top 10 central bank gold nations were 'legacy' holders, sitting on massive reserves built during or in the years following World War Two.
            

               
            

              Led then as now by the United States, eight of those Year 2000 giants were in Western Europe, and the other was Japan. Whereas today, Russia comes in 5th place, with China in 6th and India in 8th.
            

               
            

              In fact, Turkey would be in 10th position, ahead of the Netherlands, if we counted commercial-bank gold holdings − needed to back their customers' gold investment accounts − as part of its sovereign-state reserves like the central bank in Ankara does on its official data.
            

               
            

              What changed to drive this surge of non-Western gold buying?
            

               
            

              First came the early 2000s' rush of globalization. It poured Western consumers' cash into emerging-market nations' central-bank reserves, buying gas and crude oil from Russia plus manufactured goods from China and India. It also coincided with ill-advised gold bullion sales by many Western nations, made at what proved to be the eve of gold's dramatic 21st Century gains to date.
            

               
            

              Then, around 2010, the US and European financial crisis saw emerging-market central banks buy gold to spread their portfolio risk away from the Dollar. That move has since continued, but with a sharp geopolitical edge, since Russia was hit by Western financial sanctions over its invasions of Ukraine, first annexing the region of Crimea in 2014 and then attempting to take the whole country since 2022.
            

               
            

              That has seen demand to buy gold for national central bank reserves spread among many smaller nations. Because Washington and Brussels have, in the eyes of many, chosen to 'weaponize' their currencies as a tool of geopolitical control. Gold, in contrast, is no one's to control through bank clearing systems or outright default. So it shines as a way of diversifying exposure to the Dollar, to the Euro, and to the political actions of Western governments.
            











               
            
 China

              The world's 7th largest economy in US Dollar terms in 1999, China jumped to 3rd place on the GDP league table within 10 years and then overtook Japan, closing the gap with world No.1 economy the USA to less than 50% by 2014 and then to barely 30% last year.
            

               
            

              Driving that economic growth, China has built a giant manufacturing sector and earns a huge trade surplus against the rest of the world. Today it ships out over 14% of all merchandise exports by value, but it buys less than 11% of global imports. To pay for the gap, other countries – led by the USA – must send huge quantities of currency to China to get the goods that they want. That has enabled the central bank in Beijing to build massive reserves of foreign currency and bonds, led by the US Dollar.
            

               
            

              China's FX reserves at the People's Bank are so huge, its massive gold holdings still accounted for just 5.5% of the total in US Dollar terms at New Year 2025. But that ratio has more than doubled over the past 20 years as Beijing more than tripled the weight of its gold bullion reserves to reach more than 2,270 tonnes on the official data.
            

               
            

              That makes China the 6th largest national gold holder, with analysts believing that the vast bulk if not all of its gold is stored domestically. But do those figures understate China's true bullion reserves?
            

               
            

              Many analysts believe China's national gold bullion holdings are larger than the reported total, perhaps twice the size if you compare the country's visible private-sector demand against its gold mining output and bullion imports. The excess supply must have gone somewhere, and the People's Bank has in the past kept the changes in its gold holdings a secret, 
             suddenly announcing huge increases in its gold reserves.
            

               
            
 India

              For a country with such a deep and famous love for gold, India began the 21st Century very shy about buying any gold for its central-bank reserves. But looking to diversify its foreign-exchange reserves as economic growth in the world's most populous nation accelerated, the Reserve Bank of India in late 2009 bought a massive 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund.
            

               
            

India's 2009 gold purchase was the largest increase in its national gold holdings on record. It cost the central bank $1045 per Troy ounce, then the highest gold price ever. The very same level then became the final floor for the gold prices when the market slumped in 2012-2015. Perhaps that proves – as several analysts had noted – that the staff at India's central bank really do 
             know a thing or two about gold.
            

               
            

              After the 2009 purchase of IMF gold, the RBI kept its record-large gold reserves unchanged for 8 years, focusing instead on trying to boost the Rupee's exchange-rate value while building its holdings of US Dollars and other foreign currencies. Indeed, there was discussion about 
             selling or lending some of India's gold to help the central bank defend the Rupee, something it had done two decades earlier.
            

               
            

              But the officials in Mumbai then began to buy gold regularly from the end of 2017, adding almost 320 tonnes since then to take the Reserve Bank of India's total reported bullion reserves to the 8th largest worldwide among national central banks. Over 27% of the total has been added in the past 5 years alone, as our table shows.
            

               
            

              What's more, India has recently joined another key central-bank gold trend – repatriating some of its gold reserves from abroad, and keeping more of its bullion at home.
            

               
            

              More on this geopolitical trend and the reasons behind it below.
            

               
            
 Poland


               Trailing the monster gold buyers of China, India and Russia, three members of the European Union have also shown strong appetite for central-bank gold reserves over the past five years, led by Poland.
             

                
             

               While some of 
              Warsaw's gold buying appeared politically motivated under the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), Poland's gold purchases have continued since they lost power in 2023, adding another 89.5 tonnes last year alone.
             

                
             

               Hungary and the Czech Republic have meanwhile more than doubled their gold reserves since the start of 2020, eve of the global Covid pandemic. Like Poland, they are due to join the single Euro currency at some stage. But for now, they continue choosing the safety of gold bullion as a key monetary reserve.
             


               
            
 Countries doubling their gold reserves

              Other countries doubling the weight of their gold reserves since the end of 2019 include Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in eastern Europe, major African gold-mining nation Ghana, EU and Euro member Ireland (albeit to only 12.0 tonnes), plus Middle East states the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
            

               
            
 Russia

              As with China, the Central Bank of Russia is believed to keep all its gold bullion domestically, rather than holding much if any abroad.
            

               
            

              Also like China, there's debate over the true size of Russia's government gold holdings. But on the central bank's official data, Moscow now holds the world's 5th largest national gold hoard after choosing to buy almost 2,000 tonnes for its reserves over the last 20 years.
            

               
            

              That gold-buying spree took off as the price of oil and gas – which make up half of Russia's total exports and account for almost 1/5th of its entire economic output – began rising in the 'commodity supercycle' of the early 2000s. Boosting Russia's GDP as well as Moscow's tax revenues, the country's trade surplus with the rest of the world also spurred a jump in the central bank's reserves of foreign currency, most of all the US Dollar.
            

               
            

              At the same time, Vladmir Putin – then as now President of Russia – called for the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) to increase gold's share in its foreign-exchange reserves, and he also called for greater investment into Russia's gold-mining industry. The country has since moved from 5th position to No.2 among the largest producer nations, almost doubling its annual gold mine output by weight.
            

               
            

              As a major supplier to the global bullion market, Russia's gold miners hit a big problem when Western sanctions hit the country's banking sector after its invasion and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. Those US and EU sanctions meant Russia's gold miners couldn't easily access the international market to sell their output. So after reporting no sales and only purchases between 2007 and 2012, the Central Bank of Russia accelerated its 
             relentless campaign of gold buying in 2014-2018, paying domestic mining companies with Rubles to buy 80% of their output.
            

               
            

              Russia's huge gold accumulation means that it accounted for more than one-third of all national central-bank gold buying worldwide since 2004. But Moscow's dominance has slipped, sinking below 4% of the sector's net demand over the last 5 years while China accounted for 20% and India 14%, with Poland and Turkey both on 13%.
            

               
            

              First, that's because other countries began buying gold during the Western financial crisis of the late 2000s. Russia's accumulation then slowed because of the 2020 Covid Crisis, when the plunging price of crude oil hit Moscow's tax revenues and forced the Ruble's foreign exchange rate lower. Thirdly, Moscow's war on Ukraine then hit the Russian state's finances and international liquidity reserves as the US, UK and EU authorities have tried to lock it out of the global financial system.
            

               
            

              The CBR initially said it 
             wouldn't buy any domestic gold output, but it relented as Western sanctions hit both Russia's mining industry and its own ability to grow its reserves of non-Ruble assets.
            

               
            
 Why do central banks buy and hold so much gold?

              ""Gold,"" says a research paper co-written by monetary historian Barry Eichengreen in 2023 and published by the IMF, ""appeals to central-bank reserve managers as a safe haven in periods of economic, financial and geopolitical volatility.""
            

               
            

              Because those stresses have worsened so far in the 21st Century, gold's appeal has only grown for many central-bank buyers, as you can see on this interactive table (click the column headings to sort the table).
            

               
            

              Overall, the total quantity of gold held in national central-bank reserves has increased almost 19% by weight over the past 20 years – and it has jumped 7-fold in US Dollar value to $2.5 trillion – led by Russia, China, India, Turkey and Uzbekistan.
            

               
            
 How much gold does the UK have?

              The UK held 
             310.3 tonnes of gold at the end of 2024, unchanged from 2 decades before, when it ended a heavy gold-selling program which coincided with the bottom of the precious metal's long bear market. With a population of approximately 67.7 million, this works out to just 
             4.6 grams of gold per person, a relatively low figure when measured against other leading Western nations. Despite the modest reserve size, the UK's gold is securely managed by the Bank of England and plays a supporting role in the country’s foreign reserves portfolio.
            

               
            
 Why are UK gold reserves low?

              The United Kingdom’s low gold reserves can largely be traced back to that controversial decision made between 1999 and 2002 
             when the UK government sold more than half of its gold holdings at historically low prices. Instead of accumulating gold, the UK has focused its reserve strategy on a 
             diversified basket of foreign currencies and other financial assets, viewing gold more as a hedge than a primary store of value. 
            

               
            

 Uses of gold FAQs


What is gold used for in jewelry?



Gold has been used in jewelry for thousands of years primarily due to its appearance and natural lustre that doesn’t diminish over time due to gold’s inertness and resistance to tarnishing. Pure gold is relatively soft and easy to craft into delicate and intricate pieces and can also be combined or alloyed with different metals to change its colour and hardness.




What is investment grade gold?



The global wholesale gold investment market, centred in London deals in the London Good Delivery gold bullion bar. This London Good Delivery bar weighs 400 troy ounces - about 12.4 kilograms - and is about eleven inches long. It is stamped on the top (the larger face) with the manufacturer's name, the weight, and the assayed purity. The minimum specified fineness must be 99.5% pure gold, but improvements in the refining process mean that Good Delivery bars now reach 99.99% purity or higher.




Is gold jewelry subject to VAT?



In the UK gold jewelry is subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) at the standard rate of 20%. In the UK gold jewelry is considered a consumer good much like a mobile phone or TV. However, investment grade gold bullion in the form of London Good delivery bars or investment grade coins and small bars can be bought and sold free of VAT.




What percentage of gold is used for investing?



Since 2010 the percentage of gold used for investing has averaged 29%. 2013 saw the lowest investment percentage at 18% and in 2020 during the Covid pandemic the percentage of investment gold peaked at 49%. If you include Central Banks reserves as gold investment of sorts, then between 2022 and 2024 this reached 23% of gold demand.




What percentage of gold is used for technology?



Between 2010 and 2024 the percentage of gold used in technology has averaged 8% with little variation over the past decade. In comparison over the past 15 years gold used in jewelry has accounted for 50% of total gold demand.





               
            

 Central Bank Gold Reserves"
2025-05-12,"Title:When Tariffs Do Good
Article:Today's US underinvests and overconsumes...

 WITH so much attention focused on US stock markets, it seems timely to pivot away from stocks for the moment and consider the global perspective, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Globalization may be dying in terms of trade and supply chains, but financial markets are inextricably linked in ways that relatively few understand.
 The Dollar still dominates the global financial system despite the cracks in the foundation and the valid criticisms. If there's a Dollar problem in Eurodollar banks, it's sure to echo from Tokyo to Shanghai and New York. And problems in those locales affect everything else.
 I continually urge people to get away from their desks, stop staring at screens and go out and talk to real people. There's no substitute for walking the streets around the world (including the poorest areas) if you really want to know what's going on.
 I've just returned from separate visits to India, Japan and Jekyll Island, Georgia. India has the largest population in the world, has the fifth largest economy, is a nuclear power and a key member of BRICS. Japan is the fourth largest economy in the world and is a key geopolitical ally of the United States in its faceoff with China. Jekyll Island is a lovely ocean resort but is best known as the site of a secret meeting in 1910 where the Morgan, Rockefeller and Warburg interests dreamed up the Federal Reserve System.
 While India, Japan and Jekyll Island could hardly be more diverse and geographically scattered, they share a common thread. It's their economic linkage through the US Dollar. The following are some impressions I gathered during these visits that reflect the volatile situation facing markets today.
 For Trump's new tariff policies, responses varied from retaliation tariffs (proposed by Canada, China and the EU) to a much more reasonable approach of simply asking the White House for a meeting to sit down and discuss the issue amicably with a view to lowering tariffs in both directions. Japan and India fell into this latter category and are being rewarded by being included among the first countries that will actually have that opportunity. (Mexico has also taken the moderate route by engaging in discussions rather than retaliation).
 There will be some give and take. Some US tariffs on certain items are likely to remain in place. But the optimal solution is not to cut down on US purchases from those countries but for them to buy more from the US.
 That trims the US trade deficit without reducing world trade and so constitutes a win-win resolution with both India and Japan. India will likely buy more military hardware and semiconductors from the US Japan will likely buy more agricultural goods including soybeans and beef. The result will be higher growth in the US.
 Bilateral deals like this have losers. Taiwan may miss out on some semiconductor sales (although they are investing hundreds of billions of Dollars to build semiconductors in the US). Russia may miss out on military sales to India although they will remain a major energy supplier. Still, the US is done being the ""consumer of last resort"" to the world and wants to increase its profile as a seller. Trump's policies move the US in that direction.
 There is little question that the new US tariff policy will hurt some countries around the world. Not to sound harsh, but that's their problem. Trump's job is to make America great again. President Xi's job is to make China great again. Chancellor-in-waiting Merz's job is to make Germany great again.
 The US cannot carry the world on its back. If other countries (rich or poor) took Trump's growth-oriented approach instead of free riding on America, the entire world would be better off. That's certainly the view from the White House and is a good guide to US policy going forward.
 Defenders of China point to the fact that Chinese exports are not a particularly large percentage of their total GDP. (Germany is the worst offender by that metric). The problem with that data point does not come from the Chinese export number; I'm sure that's roughly correct. The distortion comes from the GDP denominator. Chinese GDP is overstated by 100% (at least) perhaps more, and China may already be in a recession.
 The reason is that China shows about 45% of its GDP as investment, mostly in the form of government backed construction. I've been to the ghost cities in China and seen more on the horizon. I got mud on my boots on the construction sites (except I was wearing Italian loafers). There is real steel, glass and copper in the buildings and it takes real labor to build them. That all counts as GDP.
 But they're all empty. If you used GAAP or international accounting principles, you would write that investment down to zero immediately. You can't put a ghost city into inventory. Buildings age rapidly and take enormous amounts to maintain. I saw this in the Congo in the early 1980s. They had a commodity boom in the 1970s and wasted much of the money on skyscrapers and other showcase projects.
 By the time I arrived there, the windows were falling out and rust stains ran down the sides of their showcases. The same thing will happen in China. Once you make that accounting adjustment for wasted investment, GDP shrinks, and the Chinese export/GDP ratio goes up exponentially. China is much more dependent on exports for any real growth than most analysts realize. Trump and Scott Bessent have this right.
 Tariffs are not automatically good or bad for an economy. Their impact depends on initial conditions when the tariffs are imposed. Tariffs are a tool that should be applied judiciously. A country that overinvests and under consumes will be hurt by tariffs. The tariffs will increase investment and restrain consumption, making the imbalance worse. That's what happened to the US under the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs in 1930 and later.
 A country that over consumes and underinvests will benefit from tariffs. That's the situation in the US today. The tariffs will increase investment as foreign and domestic investors build new plants behind tariff walls. Tariffs will channel consumer Dollars from consumption into savings, which is also desirable. In the end, consumption will expand not because of cheap imports but because of high-paying US jobs.
 China is in the category that overinvests (much of it wasted) and under consumes. China's best strategy would be to lower its own tariffs and allow its people to spend their savings on imported goods from the US and EU along with their own production. That would reduce China's trade surplus with the US, increase China's GDP and improve the well-being of its own people. It would also make an excellent opening move in any effort to get the US to reduce its tariffs on China.
 The US is making good use of tariffs. China is doing the opposite. China may be fighting to a draw in the rhetorical war, but it will definitely lose the trade war. Japan, India and Mexico are models of how to make progress. China is the poster child for how to fail.
 Global supply chains will no doubt be disrupted by the tariff and trade wars now erupting. Reconfiguring supply chains will be a one-to-two-year transition. But once it's done, the new supply chains will prove durable. Volkswagen blundered badly by putting its new Audi Q5 plant in Mexico. Their US sales are booming right now (beat the tariffs!) but will fall off a cliff once dealer inventories are drained and tariffs apply. Still, that's a management blunder not a global disruption. Supply chains are adaptable with a lag. US soybeans will soon be on their way to Japan if China doesn't want them.
 As an aside, Elon Musk's shelf life in the White House pantry will soon expire. Musk sparked a pointless feud with White House trade and manufacturing czar Peter Navarro. I know Peter fairly well (a conversation with him is like a graduate level oral exam but that's another matter). When Elon attacked Navarro, he messed with the wrong guy. Navarro took a bullet for Trump by serving four months in a federal penitentiary rather than answer a subpoena that sought to pierce the veil of executive privilege between the two. That's the kind of loyalty Trump respects. Navarro also happens to be right about tariffs despite Musk's whining.
 With regard to the Federal Reserve System that emerged from the swamps around Jekyll Island, the Fed has fallen into complete irrelevance. They have modest impact on the short-end of the yield curve (Treasury bills) but have no material impact on the intermediate- and long-end of the yield curve (Treasury notes and bonds).
 US national debt and spending will never be brought under control. But sustainable growth can be stimulated by sound fiscal policies, if not by the Fed. As long as nominal growth is greater than nominal debt increases, then the US debt-to-GDP ratio will shrink. That's the simple formula behind Scott Bessent's Three Arrows plan and it can feed on itself in a virtuous circle.
 What the Fed and the Treasury have done (mostly under Biden) is to create a global Dollar shortage, which is now morphing into a global liquidity crisis. China is not dumping Treasuries because they're distancing themselves from the Dollar. Quite the opposite. China is selling Treasuries because they're desperate for Dollars and can't get them from Japanese banks who have their own problems with carry trade unwinds.
 The liquidity crisis then goes back to European banks who can't fund in EuroDollars and US hedge funds who can't find collateral to support their derivatives basis trades. India is not immune.
 The best description of a financial crisis I've ever heard is that ""Everybody wants his money back."" We're dangerously close to that situation right now. If it gets worse, trade, tariffs and stock markets will be a sideshow. Watch Treasury yields and foreign exchange markets if you really want to know what's going on."
2025-05-09,"Title:Silver Investing Leaps Fastest Since Covid
Article:Silver buyers +108% on price plunge... 


              
           


SILVER INVESTING demand just leapt at its fastest pace since the Covid Crisis, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault.


              
           

             The surge in demand came as 
            the price of silver − which finds more than half its end-use globally from industrial and tech applications, over five times the proportion for 'useless' safe haven gold − fell hard from new multi-year highs, only to rebound as US President Trump back-tracked on some of his 'Liberation Day' trade tariffs.
           

              
           

             Across the first week of May, investors who had used BullionVault's live 24/7 marketplace to buy securely-stored 
            silver at early April's sudden 6-month lows would have been offered net gains of 15.9% (11.6% for UK Pound investors, 11.8% in Euro terms).
           

              
           

             Those gains would have been impossible for anyone buying bullion, small bars or coins outside professional storage because of those 'retail' units carrying dealing spreads as wide as 10% plus VAT sales tax as high as 20% in the UK and Europe.
           

              
           




              
           

             What drove April's surge in demand to invest in silver?
           

              
           

             While gold prices had stolen the headlines with a run of new records in 2025, silver quietly rose to its highest Dollar prices since the global financial crisis, plus 
            fresh monthly silver price records in Euro and Sterling terms across February and March.
           

              
           

             But US President Trump's shock 'Liberation Day' trade tariffs then sent silver prices reeling, spiking down like no time since the initial Covid Crash in world stock markets and commodities prices of March 2020.
           

              
           

             With silver prices spiking lower, the number of investors who chose to buy silver across April more than doubled from March. It jumped 108.0% on BullionVault's low-cost platform to the most since March 2021.
           

              
           

             The number of silver sellers meanwhile slipped 11.2% to the fewest since December last year. Together that sent the Silver Investor Index − BullionVault's unique measure of sentiment, calculated back to New Year 2012 − soaring by 7.5 points to 58.3.
           

              
           

             That marks the highest reading in 49 months, thanks to the steepest month-on-month jump in the Silver Investor Index since March 2020's series-record rise of 20.4 points.
           

              
           

             Any reading above 50.0 means that buyers outnumbered sellers across the month. The Silver Investor Index set a series peak at 75.1 as the Covid crisis first struck in March 2020, and it set a series low of 45.0 on March last year's record-heavy profit-taking.
           

              
           

             What next? April's surge of silver investment demand hasn't yet run into May. That's because it came thanks to silver prices spiking lower, just as happened in spring 2020. And longer-term, this spike in silver demand also followed nearly 2.5 years of net selling when prices rose and investors took profit, with sellers outnumbering buyers ten times on the Silver Investor Index across the previous 29 months.
           

              
           

             Silver investment by weight also leapt last month, totaling 17.8 tonnes net of customer selling. That was the heaviest 1-month buying since February 2021's net demand of 25.3 tonnes − an inflow driven by the 
            #silversqueeze ramp on social media.
           

              
           

             This April's big silver inflow took BullionVault clients' total holdings − all securely stored and insured in each user's choice of London, Singapore, Toronto or (like gold, most popular) Zurich − up to a 7-month high above 1,160.5 tonnes.
           

              
           

             That contrasts with gold, where 
            half-a-tonne of net selling last month shrank BullionVault clients' total holdings to the lowest quantity in almost 5 years, just beneath 43.8 tonnes, on the heaviest net liquidation since March 2024's record 1-tonne of gold profit-taking.
           

              
           

             But by value, gold holdings set a fresh all-time high once again, rising to $4.6 billion (£3.4bn, €4.0bn). The drop in silver prices, in contrast, meant that the surge of investor demand still put client holdings 3.9% below March's record high in US Dollar terms, down at $1.2 billion (-6.9% in GBP to £900 million, -8.5% in EUR to €1.0bn).
           

              
           

             Looking ahead, and whether or not the US-China trade war is resolved quickly, Trump's tariffs shock is likely to weigh on global trade and economic growth. The President's policies against green energy also present a headwind to silver, because the solar-energy sector worldwide has accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in total industrial demand to new record highs over the past decade.
           

              
           

             So while it's driven long term by the same inflationary and geopolitical tensions as gold, the price of the gray metal is more vulnerable to economic anxiety, as well as enjoying long-term demand growth, because of 
            silver's strong industrial uses. That made silver 40% more volatile day-to-day last month than the safe haven metal, offering larger gains to short-term traders but also carrying more risk."

GOLD's latest run of fresh record prices met the most new investors in over four years in April. But it also spurred the heaviest profit-taking, net of demand, in more than 12 months on BullionVault, 
            writes Adrian Ash at the world-leading marketplace.


              
           

             Now caring for a record $4.6 billion of securely-stored gold (£3.4bn, €4.0bn) for its global clientbase − nine-in-10 of whom live in Western Europe or North America − BullionVault saw the number of investors choosing to buy gold for the first jump 56.0% last month from March's figure, and it rose 121.6% from April last year to reach the most since February 2021.
           

              
           

             But the volume of gold selling leapt again, leading to the 5th heaviest net monthly outflow by weight since BullionVault's live 24/7 marketplace opened 20 years ago.
           

              
           

             So while 
            Trump's chaotic return to the White House has spurred a new wave of investors buying gold for the first time, the record gold prices which his policies have prompted are meeting heavy profit-taking from existing owners.
           

              
           

             That includes investors who first chose to buy gold earlier this year, seizing a quick profit as the surge in prices trumps longer-term fears over the impact of Trump's policies. Indeed, 2025's new gold buyers were 70.0% more likely to sell in April than investors who began buying gold during the previous five years.
           

              
           

             And why not? Anyone choosing to buy gold on BullionVault in January, February or March was, on average, offered a gain in US Dollar terms of 10.7% last month net of all costs (6.2% in UK Pounds, 4.0% in Euros).
           

              
           




              
           

             Across BullionVault's total client base in April, the number of people starting or adding to their gold holdings rose 26.5% from March's figure to the most since February 2021, depths of that winter's Covid wave and lockdowns.
           

              
           

             The number of sellers meanwhile rose by 51.1% to the most since March last year's record high, when a surge in Chinese demand and trading drove global gold prices sharply higher.
           

              
           

             Together that put the 
            Gold Investor Index − our unique measure of sentiment based solely on actual trading behaviour on the world's largest marketplace for personal gold investment − at 54.8 in April.
           

              
           

             Higher by 0.2 points from March and 3.2 points above April last year, that reading was 1.2 above the index's prior 12 months' average. Any figure above 50.0 means that buyers outnumbered sellers on BullionVault. The Gold Investor Index set a decade peak of 65.9 as the Covid crisis struck in March 2020, and it set a series low of 47.5 on March last year's heavy profit-taking.
           

              
           

             But while the count of investors choosing to buy gold this April outnumbered those who chose to sell for the 13th month in a row, the quantity of selling outweighed demand by almost half-a-tonne (452 kilograms), the widest margin since March 2024's record 1-tonne outflow (992kg). That reversed more than five times the net inflow made in January-to-March (86kg) − the 
            first quarterly inflow since Q2 2023 − with BullionVault users taking profit on more $46 million of gold (£35m, €41m).
           

              
           

             So with gold's new all-time highs destroying jewelry demand worldwide as Western investment remains muted net-net, this bull market is being driven by China's latest gold investing surge, plus the ongoing bid from central banks wanting to cut their exposure to US assets, most especially the Dollar.
           

              
           

             A new wave of private investment in Europe suggests similar anxiety, and April's surge in first-time investors was led by the UK, Spain and Germany, where April's inflow of new users rose 121.8%, 147.5% and 66.9% respectively above their prior 5-year monthly averages. But while the number of new US buyers was, comparatively, quiet once more in April, it did rise 45.9% month-on-month and finally joined all Western European nations in topping its previous 5-year monthly average (+39.8%). That's something not seen in four years outside of April 2023's 'mini banking crisis' and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022.
           

              
           

             Meantime, the President's back-tracking on tariffs (and on firing US Fed chairman Jerome Powell) have seen some of the heat coming out of the gold price. But the damage done to the Dollar and to America's long-term investment appeal only adds to the appeal of gold as an all-weather hedge against geopolitical and financial volatility."
2025-05-03,"Title:Trump at 100 Days, Gold at $3300
Article:A history of debasement at the federal troughs...

 TIME flies. We're already past the 100th day of President Trump's second term, writes Byron King in The Daily Reckoning.
 One piece of good news is that America's southern border is as secure as it's ever been in modern times. Trump and his people fixed that wide-open, Biden-era problem quite fast, by the novel approach of applying existing law. Amazing! Who knew?
 Now the country doesn't have to deal with 10-15,000 new arrivals every day, unknown, un-vetted people from all over the planet who just walk in and immediately become a burden on the country's broken budget.
 On the other side of the political ledger, the economy is weakening, something we predicted in articles going back deep into 2024. And many federal judges have decided to wage lawfare on the 47th President, itching for a so-called ""Constitutional crisis"" that they will blame on Trump.
 Overseas, international tensions remain high; Eastern Europe, Middle East and East Asia all speak for themselves. There's nothing easy about any of those problems, and they cost money that the country can ill-afford just now.
 All this, and last week the price of gold hit $3500 per ounce before receding to the low-$3300s price range. So gold is moving; but will it head upwards or is a pullback in the cards?
 In this note, let's discuss Trump and gold, but mostly gold.
 On 20 January, when Donald Trump took his oath of office, the gold price was $2725 per ounce. Now, after 100 days it's about $3325, an upward move of 22%.
 Correlation is not causation, as I learned many years ago in statistics class, but Trump still owns some of that move.
 Let's time-travel a decade ago to mid-2015 when the New York businessman dove into national politics and announced his run for the presidency. Back then, the price of gold was just shy of $1200 per ounce. And over the past 10 years gold has moved up by about 177%.
 Of course, Trump alone doesn't move the price of gold. Sure, he was President for four years, 2017-21. Then, he was not President for four years; and in fact, from 2021-25 he spent much of his time as a professional defendant in multiple court cases.
 Now he's back in the Oval Office at the three-plus month marker. But c'mon, man...all sorts of things move gold prices.
 In this regard, it's more accurate to say that the price of gold reflects global-scale perceptions of the inherent (and declining) value and utility of US Dollars; and yes, Trump definitely sways perceptions.
 That is, if world markets perceive that the US economy is strong and things look good for the future of America, then gold prices tend to moderate; they find a range. But if markets sense weakness in the US or its economic future, then the price of gold rises.
 Again, Trump plays a big role in all of this, but he's only one factor among many.
 To help understand the moves in gold prices, let's do a quick (I promise) history lesson. We'll start in 1914, with a standard $20 coin called a ""St. Gaudens"", named after the designer.
 This coin had a bit less than one ounce of gold in it (30.093 grams to be exact), along with a small measure of copper to harden the alloy. When it was minted 111 years ago, this item was worth a face value of $20, and the gold was also worth $20. In other words, and to channel the ghost of long-deceased tycoon J.P.Morgan, ""gold was money"" back then, and twenty Dollars bought an ounce of gold.
 If you're wondering why I chose 1914, it's because that was the first year of the US Federal Reserve, meaning America's central bank. President Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on 23 December 1913, literally in the dead of night, during a holiday period in a nearly empty Washington D.C., which tells you much about how the Fed came into being.
 Then as 1914 unfolded, and in one of the Fed's first official acts, it issued so-called ""notes"" among which some were valued at $20.
 The note specifically stated: ""The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand Twenty Dollars."" Meaning yes, you could take this to a bank and exchange the paper for a gold coin.
 Today, you might be forgiven to think that the note itself is itself $20. But no, that's not the case; that 111-year-old item is definitely not $20, it's just a promise. Again, that's because long ago, ""twenty Dollars"" meant an ounce of gold, ideally stamped into the shape of a coin.
 To nail the point, in 1914 gold was real money; paper notes were just promises, even those issued by the Fed. That's even if, as in the case above, the US government was the promisor who guaranteed payment in gold.
 Which brings us back to last month's gold price rise, up above the $3500 line, and then the subsequent pullback to the current level around $3325.
 Do the math. At $3325, you now need over 166 Federal Reserve $20 bills – like those that you get from the local ATM machine – to buy an ounce of gold; and that's just the gold, not allowing for any numismatic value to an old, rare coin.
 Look at it this way; over the past 111 years, the Dollar has shrunk in purchasing power and its ability to preserve wealth by a factor of 166. Or stated in another way, a penny from that 1914 era is now worth $1.66.
 The value-loss of the past century had nearly nothing to do with President Trump. Indeed, for that decline in the Dollar's value we can thank many Presidents: Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Roosevelt (Franklin), Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush (H.W.), Clinton, Bush (W.), Obama, Trump (first term), Biden...and now Trump 2.0 at his 100 day mark.
 Generation after generation, President after President, the US government routinely engaged in deficit spending. This is certainly the case since 1971, after President Nixon essentially tore up the World War II-era Bretton Woods agreement which kept the Dollar tied to the value of gold. Since then, federal spending, deficits and the national debt have mushroomed.
 Now the nation owes unpayable levels of national debt, around $37 trillion. That, plus something approaching $2 trillion in interest due every year, a sum which cleans out most of the cash in the Treasury's accounts. And it's axiomatic that the annual federal deficit is paid with borrowed funds, including what gets paid as interest on past debt. All in all, our national accounting scheme is a highway to ruin.
 To compound the matter, current American culture doesn't seem to know what to do with itself absent massive federal spending, particularly deficit spending which is sewn into the social fabric of the country.
 For many decades, Congress has been institutionally incapable of cutting the budget. Politically, there are few accounting priorities in Washington; they fund just about everything. And we almost never program terminations except for a few of the most grievous military procurement boondoggles.
 More recently – the past 100 days – we've witnessed the nation's collective inability to deal with spending cuts. Consider the apoplectic, psychotic reactions in many quarters to federal spending freezes and shutdowns. Or to state it another way, we hear the sound of rice bowls being broken.
 For example, we have Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which in just three months has torn through one federal agency after another. DOGE cut budgets, laid off staff, closed offices and more. And predictably, the mainstream media went nuts while people across the Republic went to court, seeking a friendly federal judge to issue an order blocking the President from not spending money that, at root, the country doesn't have.
 Did Trump cut too many things, too much, too fast? Hey, argue it any way you want because it depends on what's in your rice bowl. Does America need most of what, say, US Agency for International Development (USAID) was doing? Does the country need the Department of Education? And so on; there's a long list and no need to detail it here.
 Then again, at an even higher plane, can Trump ever begin to ""cut"" enough spending to save the financially foundering ship of state? So far, Trump has eliminated perhaps $200 billion in federal expenditures, but the number ought to be ten times that size. Good luck, right?
 The problem is that for better or worse, every federal Dollar is someone's income. So when federal spending declines, it's money no longer in someone else's pocket. It's no wonder that house sales are down, airlines are selling fewer tickets, hotels are booking fewer rooms, auto dealers are selling fewer cars, and so on.
 Whether Trump is President or not, the fact is that the country is painted into a fiscal and monetary corner. There's too much debt and interest, and not enough cash to pay for it absent inflating the currency. Sure, Captain Trump has rearranged some deck chairs on the Titanic, but the ship is still sinking based on a century of federal policy and misallocation of the country's resources. Face it, there's no nice, clean, easy, pretty way to fix what's broken.
 Now, here's one final point, which is that gold is slowly remonetizing. The world is moving towards a revised gold standard, and away from American petroDollars of the past half century. Yes, it's happening under Trump but this trend was happening in any event, Trump or not.
 Start with the gold price over the past 5 years. On the chart, you'll notice the upward trend in gold prices that began in mid-2022 during the Biden administration; in fact, it occurred not long after the US government seized and froze massive amounts of Russian sovereign wealth, at the time locked up in Treasury bonds. That is, the US weaponized its currency, its banking system, and even its underlying basis of government finance.
 In response, the world reacted as one might imagine; central banks bought gold, the price of which has moved from $1750 to the recent $3500 level, a double in under three years. And don't be misled, it was central banks that bought large blocks of metal. Gold's big move was not due to retail buyers down at the coin shops, nor hedge funds, banks, family offices, etc.
 For three years, central banks unloaded Dollars and derisked their long-term holdings. This reflects their collectively negative future perceptions of the US, its economy and strength. Frankly, it doesn't matter that Trump is now President. Central banks were buying gold in 2022 when Trump was battling state and federal prosecutors who wanted to toss him into jail.
 That is, Trump had nothing to do with what kicked off the 2022 upward move in gold prices, a rising tide on which we're now floating. Yes, Trump's recent on-again, off-again tariff policies have created confusion. His budget and spending priorities are still in formation. But that's not what elevated gold to $3500 last month.
 Gold didn't spike up because the metal is somehow shinier or denser, or because the future of the US economy looks brilliant. Gold moved up along trend lines that are three years in the making.
 The bottom line is that many people who control vast amounts of wealth realize that America's fiscal and monetary house is totally dysfunctional and unsustainable. The US budget is broken, the national debt is unpayable, the interest will kill the Treasury account.
 Will gold keep going up? Yes, of course, it's hard to see why not. Own gold or you'll live to regret it.
 Sure, expect pullbacks along the way, certainly during market sell-downs and especially if/when there's a crash. We may again see gold under $3000, but not for long. Some things are bigger than one President and his term in office. The US is over a century getting into the current mess, and we'll be many decades digging out. You had better own some gold as it all plays out."
2025-05-01,"Title:Silver Ratio Dive Bombs vs. Gold
Article:Might silver's low price to gold signal a surge ahead...?

 NO REVERSAL yet in the Silver/Gold ratio, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole, flipping the more common Gold/Silver Ratio on its head, the better to measure silver in terms of the less useful 'safe haven' precious metal.
 In fact, quite the contrary as the ratio makes its 5th day fading after a spike last week.
 The Silver/Gold ratio, in other words, remains extremely depressed. That in itself is not a big deal. It's a normal consolidation of the spike.
 But the nominal silver price, which had been conspicuously strong above its 50-day moving average despite the correction in gold and the miners, is slipping said level.
 If that is an indication of things to come, the sector correction should continue and other areas in commodities/resources could come under renewed pressure.

 A reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio would trigger a positive market for commodities/resources.
 The question is, will the recent dive bomb in the silver price vs. the gold price prove to be a pivotal event, as it did in 2020? Will a reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio come from this drop?
 If so, given relatively less downside intensity than 2020, I'd expect the upside to be highly tradable, but more moderate (sorry my silver buggish friends).
 (By the way, above, and outside of the P-51 Mustang, the Junkers JU87 'Stuka' dive bomber was this WWII fighter dork's favorite of the era. It's a bomber, but work with me here. It was so awkward and clumsy.)
 Silver, with more cyclical industrial utility than gold, would lead if inflationary pressures build up and/or renewed enthusiasm against a coming recession/bust were to manifest.
 Further implications would be for strength in the precious metals miners, despite a currently in-process healthy pullback, and further weakness in the US Dollar, which has been bearish for the entirety of Trump's term.
 As a side note, USD is due for a bounce or rally. But ""due"" implies a time variable.
 Meanwhile, the TSX-V index, home of the most speculative Canadian commodity/resource related stocks, has ticked a new high for its bottom/upturn cycle. The 'V' seems to think silver will take over from gold, potentially providing a backdrop for wider commodity participation.
 Only time will tell if this will play out, but it's interesting goings-on in a macro stimulated by an awful lot of geopolitical input."

Article:Gold bar and coin investment hits fresh record in No.1 consumer...


              
           


A SURGE in China's gold investing demand saw sales of bars and coins overtake jewelry in the first 3 months of 2025, according to new data from the China Gold Association.
           

              
           

             The January-to-March period includes the key Chinese New Year holidays, now the world's heaviest household gold-buying festival, beating India's autumn festival-of-lights, Diwali.
           

              
           

             China's 
            gold coins and retail investment bar purchases totalled 138 tonnes according to Monday's CGA data, rising 29.8% from Q1 last year.
           

              
           

             Demand for gold jewelry, in contrast, sank 26.9% year-on-year by weight to less than 135 tonnes during the first quarter of 2025.
           

              
           

             China's household investing in small bars and coins overtook jewelry purchases last spring as well, when 
            2024's surge of Chinese gold trading coincided with global prices jumping to new all-time highs at $2400 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             Both China's domestic and global gold prices have since risen by more than 1/3rd again, peaking at $3500 this April as global stock markets sank in the face of returning US President Donald Trump announcing massive 'Liberation Day' trade tariffs on goods imported into the USA.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Suppressed by 
            high gold prices, demand for gold jewelry continues to be weak,"" says the government-mandated Chinese gold trade body in 
            its Q1 report.
           

              
           

             ""[But] the complex and ever-changing geopolitical situation and economic uncertainty have further highlighted the hedging and value-preserving function of gold. Private investment demand for gold bars and gold coins has grown rapidly and substantially.""
           

              
           

             By value, and calculated using the Shanghai Gold Exchange's 3-month average, jewelry demand was virtually unchanged in January-to-March from the first quarter of 2024, reaching ¥90 billion based on the CGA's weight data.
           

              
           

             Gold coin and bar demand in contrast leapt 77.9% year-on-year to a new record above ¥92bn, equivalent to $12.7bn.
           

              
           

             China's gold-backed ETF trust funds also saw heavy inflows, the CGA notes, with the quantity of bullion needed to back their shares in issue swelling by 1/5th.
           

              
           

             Dominating the Asian market for 
            gold ETFs but still only a fraction of the sector worldwide, China's gold ETFs have 
            since continued to grow rapidly in April as both Chinese and global gold prices ran to new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             ""Bank gold trading volume has also increased significantly,"" says China Business News, with smartphone gold trading apps a focus for ""gold fever"" according to other Chinese news sites and social media posts.
           

              
           

             ""We're seeing day-trading behavior typically associated with speculative stocks now appearing in what was traditionally considered a conservative investment,"" says Dr.Liu Feng, a finance professor at Peking University.
           

              
           

             ""Transaction sizes have decreased while frequency has increased,"" says Australian mining news and analysis site Discovery Alert, ""hallmark signs of retail rather than institutional participation"" with the Shanghai Gold Exchange now seeing trades of less than 100 grams account for 3/5ths of all transactions, up from 35% in 2023.
           

              
           

             Over the last 2 years, the Yuan price of gold has risen by 77.6%. That's taken the SGE price of 100g up from ¥44,300 (then equal to $6,410) to ¥78,200 (now $10,750), equal to 3 months' 
            average disposable income in Shanghai, the country's highest-wage city.
           

              
           

Borrowing to trade gold has become ""a hot topic"" on Chinese social media according to the 
            Shenzhen Business Daily.
           

              
           

             Banks are ""intermittently"" showing physical gold coins and small bars as ""out of stock"", says China Business Network, with branches in Shenzhen requiring would-be buyers to book an appointment online or through the bank's smartphone app.
           

              
           


              Separate estimates for China's Q1 gold investment and jewelry demand are due out Wednesday this week, when the gold mining industry's London-based World Gold Council issues its global 
             Gold Demand Trends report for January-to-March.
            

               
            

              Using data gathered by specialist analysts Metals Focus, the WGC's total figure for Chinese household demand lagged the CGA's total number by almost 7% for 2023 and 2024."
2025-04-21,"Title:The Reality of Trump's Coal Economics
Article:Fossil fuels below 50% of US electricity output...

 BETWEEN raising and lowering tariffs on imported goods, President Donald Trump made time to sign an executive order aimed at reviving America's ""beautiful clean coal industry"", writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 The order outlines an ambitious strategy to reclassify coal as a critical mineral, reopen federal lands to mining, fast-track environmental reviews and provide federal support for coal-fired electricity and coal exports.
 The move comes at a pivotal time. Demand for electricity is surging as the US seeks to reindustrialize and build out new infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, electric vehicles (EVs) and high-performance computing.
 According to S&P Global, the US will see greater electricity demand growth in the next decade than in any ten-year period in history.
 
 Shares of Peabody Energy − the largest US coal producer, responsible for mining over 104,000 short tons in 2023 − closed up 9.21% on the Tuesday of Trump's big tariff crash bounce.
 That was the company's best one-day increase since 6 November 2024, the day after Trump won his second term. Over the longer term, however, Peabody's stock has plummeted, losing close to 60% of its value since Election Day.
 
 I admire the President's focus on strengthening US energy security. Reliable, affordable power is the bedrock of economic growth and national competitiveness. While I understand his intent, I believe the long-term investment case is moving in a different direction − and it's one that leans heavily toward renewables.
 Coal is often described as a powerful energy source, and indeed it helped build the industrial age. But today, coal is struggling to compete on cost. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for new coal plants is more than double that of solar, wind and natural gas, according to BloombergNEF. And that's before factoring in the environmental and public health costs of coal extraction and combustion.
 The simple truth is that coal is no longer the cheapest or cleanest option.
 
 The market knows this. Coal's share of power generation in advanced economies has been in steady decline since it peaked in 2007, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
 In the US, coal fell below 15% for the first time ever in 2024, and the trend is accelerating. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) projects that the remaining 115,000 megawatts (MW) of coal capacity could be shuttered by 2040. Nearly a quarter of the existing US coal fleet is already scheduled to retire by 2029.
 Many of the plants still online are operating far below capacity. Reopening closed plants, or extending the lives of aging ones, is highly inefficient. Maintenance costs increase with age, and many units are now over 50 years old. The last large coal plant built in the US came online in 2013, and since then, the pipeline has run dry.
 It's no secret that the global energy makeup is transitioning. Coal generation hit a new record high in 2024, largely due to growth in emerging markets, but even in China and India, two of the world's largest coal consumers, ambitious plans are underway to increase cleaner energy. China led the world in solar additions in 2024, while India is scaling up renewables to meet its growing energy needs.
 The US saw coal consumption fall 4% last year, on top of a 17% drop in 2023. Meanwhile, renewables are setting new records. Just last month, US wind and solar generation hit an all-time high of 83 terawatt-hours (TWh), while fossil fuels' share of the electricity mix fell below 50% for the first time ever.
 It's clear where the wind is blowing. I believe this trend represents an attractive investment opportunity.
 Renewable capacity additions around the world surged by 25% last year, led by solar and wind. Solar alone is expected to account for more than half of all new generating capacity in the US this year, with my home state of Texas leading the way. More than a third of all new solar panels is expected to be installed right here.
 What's even more compelling is that renewables are now cheaper not just than building new coal plants − they're cheaper than operating most existing coal plants. According to Energy Innovation, 99% of US coal plants could be replaced with new solar or wind at a lower cost.
 Again, I agree with President Trump that AI and data centers will be massive energy consumers in the coming years. As executive chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, I should know. Between now and 2030, electricity consumption by data centers alone is set to more than double to an estimated 945 TWh. Pinning our hopes on coal to meet those needs is a backward-looking solution, I believe.
 Coal may see a temporary boost from regulatory relief, and some investors may profit in the short term. But in the long run, I think the writing is on the wall. The global transition to cleaner, cheaper energy is well underway. Investors who want to stay ahead of the curve should follow the data and the money."
2025-04-15,"Title:US Trade: The Real Story
Article:Ignore the Harvard men...

 PETE NAVARRO is in the news, writes Bill Bonner at The Daily Reckoning.
 He is believed to be the 'architect' of Trump's tariff policies. Fox:
 ""White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on US imports would not be enough for the administration to lift its new levies announced last week. 'Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters,' Navarro said on CNBC's Squawk Box.""
 Say what?
 Even with zero tariffs Vietnam would still be subject to 'reciprocal' charges from the US? How could Vietnam eliminate the 'non-tariff barriers?' Make sure its currency doesn't go down against the Dollar? Change its tax policies so they do not encourage exporting?
 Would it have to give up what Adam Smith called its 'comparative advantage' − cheap labor − and raise wages to the US unionized standard, with all America's labor protections, over-time pay, holidays, and pensions?
 Will oil rich nations have to compensate for having cheap energy? Cold nations will have to pay a penalty for not needed A/C? Will warm ones need to apologize for their bananas?
 White House experts don't actually analyze any of those things. They just look at trade volumes. So, the only way they will know if Vietnam is not 'cheating' is if the balance of trade is even.
 By this formula the US was a cheater from 1875 to 1971...it ran trade surpluses in all those years. It had a very efficient, advanced economy. Should it have been punished for that?
 It was only after Nixon changed the world's money system that the deficits began...and never ended. The new 'fake' Dollar − that the US can effectively 'print' at will – is the cause of America's chronic trade deficits, not NTBs.
 The real story: after 1971, the US could buy what it needed with its inexhaustible new money; it didn't need to compete.
 Navarro is said to have a PhD in economics from Harvard. This makes us very suspicious of Harvard's standards. But Harvard has figured prominently in US history. Usually disastrously.
 In theory, the role of a Harvard education – we get this first-hand from sharing our marriage bed with a Harvard grad for the last 41 years – is to discipline the mind so it thinks with rigorous logic, and furnish it with enough literature, history and science to give it something to think about.
 How then does a man like Pete Navarro end up with a PhD from that august institution? Perhaps its standards have slipped?
 A bastion of privilege, power and positivism, Harvard cultivates a pernicious weed – the person who believes he can use his brain to know what others should do...and use the government to make them do it. Sprouting from seed in Cambridge, the weed spreads...and soon has covered the ground all the way to the Potomac.
 Trump was looking for an economic advisor. His son-in-law reportedly found Navarro's book (perhaps then on the remainder table, along with our forgotten classic ""Empire of Debt"").
 In 'Death by China' the author frequently quotes another Harvard guy, Ron Vara. The only problem is that there is no Ron Vara. He is Navarro's made-up alter-ego. In effect, the 'Death by China' theme is supported by two Harvard men – one fictional, both delusional.
 And now word on the street is that Ron Vara is butting heads with Elon Musk. Here's Politico:
 ""In the early hours of Saturday morning, Musk took to his social media platform X to launch an apparent attack at the President's senior trade counselor, taking jabs at Navarro under a video in which he explained the Trump administration's logic in levying tariffs during a CNN appearance. The Department of Government Efficiency head replied to another user's comment on the video lauding Navarro's explanation, writing of the economist: 'He ain't built shit'.""
 Then, Elon's brother joined the scuffle. Business Insider:
 ""Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of Elon Musk, said on Monday that President Donald Trump's slate of reciprocal tariffs would be like imposing a 'permanent tax' on US consumers.""
 The Musk team and the Trump/Navarro Team are not on the Same Team. Musk represents real economic interests...Trump is politics incarnate.
 Tariffs are a political move...part demagoguery, part cupidity. They make politicians more powerful as they get to choose who pays what to whom. And they make a few insiders richer as they favor some industries over others. But ultimately, they weaken the economy and make everyone else poorer.
 Eventually, the two teams are going to come to blows. And maybe sooner than later. Newsweek:
 Musk's open criticism of White House policy is the first time that the relationship between himself and Trump has appeared to be strained.
 Musk:
 ""A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing. Results in the ego/brains>>1 problem.""
 More to come..."
2025-04-13,"Title:Forget the Fed, Don't Fight the Yield Curve
Article:Too late already. As always...

 The BOND market's yield curves imply a dovish Fed to come, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 But the Fed will sit on its ample behind for as long as it takes for it to finally act on the message.
 Eventually the Fed will be dragged into action; dovish action. Much like the Fed was compelled, despite its tardiness, to finally fight inflation with hawkish action on the last cycle, as we noted in real time back in that phase.
 The effects of the inflation problem created by the Fed and government in 2020 could have been less severe had the Fed gotten off its ass and addressed the problem sooner. Instead, it held off in paranoid fashion until it was sure the asset bubble in equities, which it was blowing, was in full flight.
 Was this political? I can't comment. But the inflation was birthed under Trump and it was sustained way too long under Biden (with Janet Yellen riding in the side car as Treasury secretary).
 Fast forward to today. CME Group's FedWatch tool − which I have come to realize is not the skilled forward prognosticating entity many think it is (it all too often reacts to events and indications in real time) − sees a 70% chance of a Fed Funds rate hold in May. Although it also sees an 87% chance of a cut by one or two basis points in June.
 On April 7th we noted that the Yield Curves were painting the Fed ""behind the curve"". That was due to the 10-year-minus-3-month curve lagging the 10yr-2yr. On April 9th we reviewed the Yield Curve steepener, indicating an economic bust in the not too distant future.
 Proof, you demand? Here it is.
 Historically, Yield Curve steepeners have never failed to bring on recessions to one degree or another at some point, usually after the steepener has expressed itself for several months. The current steepener need not necessarily bring on a recession just yet. But it is very likely coming. The shaded areas on the chart were the recessions of yore.
 
 The yield curve anchored by the 3 month T-bill is more heavily influenced by the Fed's status (holding), and the curve anchored by the 2 year Treasury note is more subject to a (relatively) freer bond market.
 But while the Yield Curve anchored by the 2-year Treasury Note continues on its steepening way, it is dragging the 10-3 chart directly into the fight and thus, it is dragging the Fed into the fight.
 The concept of short-term Treasury yields declining in relation to longer-term Treasury yields (the definition of a curve steepener) means gathering risk-off sentiment in the markets (well, that's been obvious even to those who don't know what a yield curve is) as capital flies toward the safest liquidity in short-term Treasuries and T-bills.
 This is not a discussion about gold, the ultimate risk-off asset in times of liquidity stress. Gold is and has been just fine, when it was languishing below 1100 per ounce. a few years ago and when it is booming to new highs today. It is insurance and safety in a way that bonds, the debt of sovereign nations at economic war, are not.
 Insofar as we are discussing bonds, this is the kind of pressure that will drag the Fed into action, probably whenever the current stock market rally (favored view is that it is a bear market rally) ends."
2025-04-10,"Title:Some Confirmation Bias
Article:Plus some initial forecasts for Trump 2.0...

 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 2.0 – this time, with real tariffs – has just made landfall, says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 The market focus (aka projectile vomiting) has primarily been on stocks, but like other commentators, we suspect the real story is taking place in the bond market.
 Here is investment consultant Jeremy McKeown's take, as at 7th April 2025, via Linked-In:
 ""Asian markets fell high single-digit percentages overnight as trade war fears increased over the weekend.
 ""Safe havens include the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and gold, all relatively resilient.
 ""Everything else is being torched.
 ""Trump cheerleaders from last year, such as Bill Ackman, have condemned the Trump tariff policy, and even Scott Bessent's mentor Stan Druckenmiller spoke out against it.
 ""The Donald remained unphased, saying he hadn't checked his 401(k) this weekend and compared his policy to necessary medicine.
 ""While the headlines focus on the global traded goods sector, a more meaningful analysis might be on the capital and liquidity flows these tariff moves have set in motion.
 ""As Bessent has said, he is the US's biggest bond salesman, comparing his most pressing job to securing the pilot doors on US commercial aircraft before 9/11. While Ackmann and Druckenmiller have capital at risk that, like others, is being liquidated, Bessent worries about the Treasury 10-year yield and the federal debt burden.
 ""What is clear is that this phase will pass. However, portfolio risk adjustments are necessary.
 ""The narrative for the recovery is still in production; it will centre on a collapsed oil price, lower interest rates, an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, some DOGE successes and massive supply-side reforms, including evidence of inward investment into the US economy.
 ""Of course, none of this is sure to work; otherwise, investors would be happy to hold their nerve. After all, human nature fears loss twice as much as gains; the adjustment can continue for some time.
 ""The new administration has achieved its objective of removing the Trump Put. It needs to collect funds into its safe-haven Treasuries before it executes a pivot back to risk.
 ""However, every stage of this process is fraught with danger.""
 In an earlier post from the weekend of April 5th/6th, Jeremy made the following comparison:
 ""This is America's Brexit. This is when global investors re-assess their belief in American Exceptionalism, or at least the price they are being asked to pay for it. As with Brexit, rational economic man cannot comprehend the degree to which some are prepared to take short-term pain for their longer-term ambition. In this case, the price the US administration is prepared to pay to restore manufacturing jobs to Detroit and the wider US rust belt. This is MAGA 2.0 in action and damn the torpedoes!""
 We agree. The original Brexit vote marked the point at which British blue-collar workers issued a definitive vote of no confidence in the globalist experiment, complete with offshoring, a hollowing-out of traditional industry, and unwanted mass migration, known as the European Union.
 Predictably, this vote was ignored by the so-called elites in London and Brussels. Trump 2.0 may prove a harder nut to crack.
 Trump doesn't (personally) have to worry about re-election, so he can spend some quality time as a wrecking ball of change, and seizing the nettle of the US' unsustainable debt load. Whether by accident or design, and probably the latter, tariff chaos helps lower US sovereign borrowing costs in a year when roughly $9 trillion will mature or need to be refinanced.
 We happen to think that the damage done to US sovereign creditworthiness and credibility by the Biden administration egging on the freezing of Russian foreign reserves was and is irreversible: that particular genie is not going back in the bottle.
 So we remain of the view that the future involves a concentration on real assets as opposed to the illusion of fiat ones. So in turn we are more than happy to keep the faith with regard to gold, silver and sensibly priced miners, notwithstanding the elevated volatility that Trump 2.0 has injected into the markets.
 Here is what the retired wealth manager Clive Thompson, again via Linked-In, expects. Irrespective of some perhaps inevitable confirmation bias, we also tend to agree:
 ""Tariffs! You feel you should DO something? Read this first. This is a step-by-step guide to what we can expect for stocks, bonds, the economy and gold.
 1) America imposes tariffs. 2) Some foreign nations respond with retaliatory tariffs. 3) Stocks fall; recent purchases show losses. 4) Worst hit are exporters to the US, US importers, and high P/E growth stocks. 5) US sellers shift money into deposits, money-market funds, T-Bills, and T-Bonds. 6) Foreign sellers do the same with domestic equivalents (eg, gilts, OATs, Bunds). 7) Gold and silver hold gains thanks to central bank buying. 8)""Buy-the-dip"" investors sell gold to buy stocks. But stock rallies are brief. 9) Nervous foreign nations reduce US Treasuries, buy more gold, undeterred by price. 10) Prices rise, wages don't. Everything costs more. 11) With limited funds, people cut spending on both US and foreign goods. 12) Global consumption drops. Economies contract. Stocks are falling. 13) Some businesses fail. 14) Many see reduced profits or slower growth. 15) Asset allocators, analyzing losses, see gold would've improved portfolio Sharpe ratios. 16) Portfolio managers begin adding gold. 17) Layoffs rise. Unemployment climbs. A global recession follows. 18) Perversely stocks are rising strongly from the bottom. Stocks are already anticipating central bank stimulus. 19) Slowing economies reduce tax revenues, partly offset by US import tariffs. 20) Governments borrow more to cover shortfalls and rising social costs. 21) Central banks blame consumer price rises on a ""one-off"", not underlying inflation. 22) They lower interest rates multiple times to try and boost economies. Longer term Treasury yields remain stubbornly high. 23) With fewer surplus Dollars from lower exports, foreign nations buy fewer US Treasuries. 24) Americans buy some, but only at higher yields. Treasury prices fall, yields rise. 25) Higher yields raise debt servicing costs. 26) The Fed becomes lender of last resort, prints money to buy T-Bonds − like in 2008 − 2011 and 2020–2023. Foreign central banks follow. 27) We have global QE. 28) More money boosts economies. Stocks rise. Gold soars.""
 In a financial world experiencing genuine chaos and wild tectonic shifts, there is the possibility that the secular bull in the monetary metals and real assets has only just begun.
 We can live, quite happily, with that."

Article:Gold/Silver Ratio just topped 100 recession level...


              
           


NOBODY does tariffs bigger or better than Donald J.Trump, 
            writes Adrian Ash in this note sent to BullionVault users last Friday, updated (where needed) for today.


              
           

             Trump's trade tax economics are so big, so beautiful...
           

              
           

             ...albeit (and wisely) leaving 
            gold and silver bullion exempt from the 'Liberation Day' tariffs...
           

              
           

             ...that foreign governments are speechless. Almost.
           

              
           

             ""Incomprehensible,"" say Switzerland and Germany.
           

              
           

             ""Bullying,"" says China.
           

              
           

             ""Extremely grave,"" says Japan.
           

              
           

             ""Irrelevant,"" 
            says Russia.
           

              
           

             As for business and media, ""It's a lot to try and absorb,"" 
            says one UK exporter.
           

              
           

             ""It's an astonishing act of self-harm,"" says the 
            Financial Times (reprising what it said about the UK's Brexit vote and fretting over the same trade-led recession if not depression).
           

              
           

             ""They used ChatGPT!"" squeals another economics specialist about 
            how Team Trump 2.0 arrived at the figures on that big piece of card he waved at Wednesday's press conference.
           

              
           

             But the Prez himself?
           

              
           

             ""The markets are going to boom, stocks are going to boom, the country is going to boom,"" said a defiant Trump late Thursday, pretty much quoting the Vengaboys, as US tech stocks made their worst 1-day crash since summer 2020's Covid Crisis.
           

              
           

             ""We're feeling good,"" 
            added his VP J.D.Vance the same day.
           

              
           

             ""It could be worse in the markets.""
           

              
           

             And lo! It is.
           

              
           




              
           

             Look, gold isn't immune to Trump's tariff crash in the markets.
           

              
           

             If the plunge in risk assets continues (Monday and Tuesday's bounce aside) there's a chance that the price of gold will fall further...
           

              
           

             ...like it did in the first flush of the Covid Catastrophe in March 2020...
           

              
           

             ...or like it really did (in Dollar terms) during 
            the Lehmans phase of the global financial crisis in 2008.
           

              
           

             That's because, as traders liquidate winning positions to cover losses elsewhere, gold will yet again stand out as a big winning position. 
           

              
           

             But as things stand, gold has lost barely 1% in London's bullion market this week from last Friday's record week-end high.
           

              
           

             The contrast with stocks, energy and base metals suggests that gold's safe haven appeal is intact. The contrast with silver also says that strategic gold buying by central banks and other big players has most likely continued as Trump's tariff threats become reality...
           

              
           

             ...because sovereign investment is something the more industrially-useful precious metal lacks.
           

              
           

             Indeed, silver has crashed to Depression-era lows against gold, with the ratio of gold to silver prices peaking since Trump's Rose Garden announcement above 100...
           

              
           

             ...a level 
            last seen (briefly) during the Covid Crash, and only then for just the second time since the early 1940s, back when the USA was crawling out of a decade-long recession while most of the rest of the world was 
            throwing itself into total war.
           

              
           

             Third time's a charm?
           

              
           




              
           

             Now averaging 90.0 ounces of silver so far in 2025, the price of gold has topped Covid's 2020 economic depression annual average of 89.1, as well as the global recession of 1991's annual average of 89.3, when the ratio touched 100 for just 1 day.
           

              
           

             That speaks to just how awful the economic outlook has become.
           

              
           

Useful stuff? Yours!
           

              
           

Useless safe haven? Buy! Or at least, hold.
           

              
           

             But this spike in 
            the Gold-Silver Ratio is also, so far, driving a surge in silver demand among contrarian investors.
           

              
           

             Net purchases by BullionVault users have now totalled over 12 tonnes inside 6 days since Trump unveiled his big, beautiful tariffs.
           

              
           

             That reverses 90% of last month's net selling, when the Gold/Silver Ratio averaged just below 90. On a daily basis, it's running at 2/3rds the pace of March 2020, when BullionVault users hoovered up a record 96.9 tonnes of 
            the indispensable metal in 1 month.
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, and like gold, silver has seen the price gap in New York futures over London physical collapse after 
            the White House decided to exempt bullion from the Liberation Day tariffs, just like everyone (should have) expected.
           

              
           

             But while 
            the incentive for shipping yet more gold into US Comex warehouses has now dipped below $10 on the most-active June contract...
           

              
           

             ...around half the level you'd expect here in early April...
           

              
           

             ...the gap between London silver and New York's May contract has evaporated entirely, running at precisely 0 cents per ounce as the weekend began and actually going negative today.
           

              
           

             It's important to remember: US investment demand didn't drive the flood of bullion into US storage, now totalling well over 4 years' worth of total US gold demand and 4 years' of US industrial silver demand.
           

              
           

             It was simply a financial-market arbitrage, spurred by the threat of trade tariffs on bullion and now erased by the exemption for gold and silver bars listed in Wednesday's Presidential action.
           

              
           

             To date, it looks like gold is holding firm as that dislocation unwinds. Whereas silver is getting badly hit by speculators rushing to close out their bullish bets on New York futures.
           

              
           

             So the opportunity in silver, in other words, may have longer to run. If it turns out to be an opportunity at all, that is...
           

              
           

             ...rather than Trump's 
            
             Voodoo
            
Vengaboy Economics marking the start of something even uglier than the Great Depression or the cataclysm of Covid."
2025-04-08,"Title:Back to 1909 with Trump's Tariffs
Article:Global trade war explodes...

 OUCH, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Global markets are in freefall in response to President Donald Trump's universal 10% tariff on all goods being imported into the US, with as many as 60 countries facing ""reciprocal"" tariffs on top of that.
 When we combine all new tariffs in 2025 so far, including the raft of reciprocal tariffs announced last Wednesday, we're looking at an average effective rate of 22.5%, according to Yale's Budget Lab.
 That's the highest such rate since 1909 − the same year that President Howard Taft proposed the idea of an income tax to Congress.
 
 As I have pointed out before, tariffs are a type of tax paid for by domestic import-export companies, who often pass the additional cost on to consumers. This can turbocharge domestic inflation.
 Tariffs can also lead to full-blown trade wars, as we saw in the federal government's previous attempts to raise revenue through the taxation of imported goods.
 The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, enacted in 1930, is widely believed to have exacerbated the effects of the Great Depression, as global trade tanked a whopping 65%. A few decades prior, then-Representative William McKinley's tariff act triggered retaliation from other nations, leading to higher prices for US consumers.
 (If you need to brush up on your Smoot-Hawley history, I recommend the famous ""Anyone? Anyone?"" scene in 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off.)
 As was the case then, we're already seeing retaliatory tariffs. China announced that it will impose a 34% duty on all goods imported from the US. If this weren't enough, automobile imports face a steep 25% tariff. Trump claims he ""couldn't care less"" if foreign manufacturers raise prices for US consumers, and from the looks of it, they may need to − and significantly so, in some cases.
 Mitsubishi, for instance, will need to increase the price of its vehicles by more than 20% here in the US to offset the new levy, according to estimates by CLSA.
 The manufacturer expected to fare the best under this tariff regime is Tesla, whose supply chain is well-integrated in the US. More than 62% of the company's facilities are located domestically, with approximately a quarter of its suppliers also based in the US, according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, fewer than half of Ford's facilities worldwide are currently located in the US.
 This could be constructive for Tesla, whose stock has lost over half of its value since its peak in mid-December, making it one of the worst performers of the year so far. The carmaker's quarterly sales fell a significant 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due mainly to political backlash against CEO Elon Musk.
 When it comes to new home purchases, bad economic news could be good news. Mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 4% on Friday due to concerns about the trade war. Bond yields generally fall when prices rise.
 Granted, home prices in the US are still hovering near record highs, but current homeowners may be able to refinance sooner than expected.
 Lower yields are also good for gold. Because it's a non-interest-bearing asset, gold starts to look more attractive as yields fall, especially when inflation remains historically elevated, as it is now. The 10-year yield is nominally 4.1% right now, but when you factor in the 2.8% headline inflation rate from February, the real yield is closer to 1.3%.
 If yields fall further or if inflation jumps higher due to tariffs, we may end up with negative real yields, which have historically been bullish for gold prices.
 The yellow metal is trading down as it's swept up in the broader selloff, and I believe investors should strongly consider buying these dips. Gold just notched its best quarter since 1986, ending March at $3123 per Troy ounce, and there could be further upside momentum."
2025-04-06,"Title:Spanners, Wrenches, Steepener and Gold
Article:Cue gold's perfect macro to strike...

 A MAN sits in the White house, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 A different kind of man. A man who does not like diplomacy or going along and getting along with his global counterparts. He likes throwing spanners and monkey wrenches all around the macro.
 There may one day be revealed a positive outcome to this, through negotiations. But on the face of it, nobody wins a tariff war. Least of all the biggest consumerist nation on the planet.
 Ignore the media panic. It's all noise. It's real, but for the sake of where we are going – and have been indicated to be going for over a year now – it is noise. Recession signals kicked in when yield curves steepened and de-inverted. Always disregard the media's view on yield curves, which in 2023 was that the deep inversion meant imminent recession. The media harvested many eyeballs with that ill-conceived fear campaign as the economy remained firm and the ""boom"" side of the boom/bust continuum, well, continued.
 It's the subsequent curve steepener that gets ya. We married other indicators to the yield curve view in 2024 for a clear picture of an oncoming recession, economic counter-cycle and waning of confidence. These are primary considerations for a bullish fundamental view of the counter-cyclical gold mining sector.
 I used the Macrocosm (the larger the planet, the more important the fundamental consideration for gold stocks) for all too many years to illustrate why a proper and sustainable macro backdrop was NOT in place for gold stocks. For much of the last year it has increasingly confirmed, rather than denied a positive backdrop for gold mining.
 From 2004 to 2024 the economy was boosted by inflationary policy-making more often than not. And every downturn (most dynamically, in 2020) was met with balls out policy. Hence, Jupiter was never allowed to engage beyond quick events, as policymakers reliably sprang into action to mop up the situation with interest rate and bond market manipulation, the mechanics of money printing and inflation.
 
 Saturn came into alignment as yield curves aborted their deep inversions and began to steepen in 2023.
 Then last year, they de-inverted (an economic boom runs with a flattening toward or to inversion, a bust runs with a steepener) and the coming economic down cycle came closer into view. Saturn fully engaged when gold's ratio to the last inflated man standing, the S&P 500, busted upward just recently.
 The Gold/Silver ratio is a wild card as silver can sure lead the precious metals complex. But speaking purely as a fundamentalist, gold rising in silver terms is more aligned with proper gold mining fundamentals, since silver has much more cyclical/industrial utility than gold.
 All the other planets are in fine form as well. A couple notes:

 Some planets should be larger (but I had to work with the art I had). Specifically, Stagflation, which is a very viable outcome of a global trade war.
 Cyclical Inflation and China/India Love Trades are provided because there were two tiny little planets that needed to be assigned a level of importance. That level is minuscule and is really just for comic relief, especially when you think about promotional interests out there touting these elements as serious gold stock fundamentals to their herds.
 The bottom line is that we are now in the Macrocosm, some 12 years (+/-) after I came up with the pictorial view of what we would look for to be real fundamental gold mining bulls. It is fully engaged.

Gold miners (GDX) had been a card carrying member of the broad stock market rally until the election slammed the counter-cyclical sector on Trump economic optimism. As the realities of the initial destructiveness of a global tariff war become more widely known, the counter-cyclical sector has rallied while the cyclical stock market has tanked. Makes sense, folks.
 Don't over-think it. The gold mining case dearly needed gold to outperform the stock market and that is what is happening. By extension, so too are the miners now outperforming the stock market.
 
 Using the monthly chart of HUI, we have noted a painfully volatile bull market that began in 2016. You may recall that back then, by mid-year the initial launch was doomed because silver was leading gold, then commodities and stock markets. It was an inflationary move for the macro. WRONG setup! Silver bugs led the charge and the whole cacophony topped out that summer, after we noted the degrading fundamentals as the pumpers pumped.
 Since then Huey has ground its way to a low in 2018, a high in 2020, a low in 2022 and voila, here we are on a wave 5. It is likely that HUI will pause or pull back here at or above resistance. Our minimum target has been to make a higher high to 2020's 373. The operating target of 500 may not be the ultimate target. It's just been the objective we've had since bottoming out at '4'.
 Unlike in 2016, the proper backdrop is in play. What we have developing now is a deflationary situation. Why, just look at Treasury bonds, which I've held and increased as cash equivalents, rising nominally and paying income, as illustrated in NFTRH each weekend. The inflation hysteria blew out in 2023.
 
 I do expect the 30-year Treasury yield ""Continuum"" (another of my indicators that has a nickname) to find support prior to the next phase of inflation. But first, a deflationary liquidity episode despite or maybe because of the man throwing wrenches all over the place. Later will come the next inflation phase, and it will likely be of the Stag variety. In other words, economically corrosive.
 Above is the state of the Continuum, which I expect to decline as the Fed weakens and the macro contracts over the coming months. Take note of the red trend lines that had so well resisted the yield for decades. It was busted in 2022 and has now turned up. A decline in the 30-year yield to approximately that level (roughly the 3.5% area) could be all she wrote for the deflation play before the next and more painful inflationary phase engages.
 Gold mining stocks are counter-cyclical. A counter-cyclical backdrop was indicated to be engaging last year, but the Biden administration's predictable fiscal operations kept the macro picture intact into the election. This was a major theme we carried all though 2024, right into November, after which the theme was that Trump would be left with an unwinding macro.
 I just did not know about how many spanners and monkeys he was planning to throw around to help it along. NFTRH is locked in on events that are in play because they are what we have anticipated and patiently awaited. You can trust me to call what I see, not what I want to see or worse, what you may want to see.
 Finally, I am able to call the macro in a favorable way for gold stocks. The going will be volatile, but we are in a new macro, one that is finally aligned for the gold stock sector."
2025-04-01,"Title:Gold Investing Snaps 6 Quarters of Profit-Taking Amid Trump's 'Perfect Chaos'
Article:President's volatile US policy drives gold to new record prices...


              
           


GOLD's latest run of fresh record prices has failed to dent 2025's rebound in private demand to invest in physical bullion, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault. 


              
           

             The price of 'safe haven' bullion rose 19.4% across the first 3 months of this year, 
            gold's strongest quarterly price increase since Q3 1986 in US Dollar terms. Gold also set 20 new all-time highs, the most in any quarter since summer 1979's record count of 22.
           

              
           

             But rather than selling more gold than they chose to buy, private investors as a group snapped 6 calendar quarters of profit-taking in gold to grow their combined holdings on BullionVault, albeit by only 86 kilograms (0.2%) to 44.2 tonnes.
           

              
           

             Coupled with the precious metal's latest price jump, that took the value of BullionVault clients' gold investments – all securely stored and insured in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or most popular Zurich – to a new record of $4.4 billion (£3.4bn, €4.1bn, ¥663bn), higher from New Year's Eve by 19.5% (+15.9% in GBP, 15.1% in EUR, 14.0% in JPY).
           

              
           

             Already the best-performing asset of the 21st Century to date, gold is surging as Trump 2.0 turns what was left of the US-led world order on its head. The 
            US President's tariff strategy and his increasingly volatile stance on Russia's war against Ukraine are proving the perfect chaos for new record gold prices, stronger even than the Covid catastrophe of five years ago.
           

              
           

             The precious metal thrives on geopolitical uncertainty, economic stagflation and falling stock markets. Trump is delivering all three.
           

              
           




              
           

             Like net demand by weight, the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of sentiment which tracks the number of buyers against the number of people choosing to sell – also rose to its strongest quarterly reading since spring 2023, averaging 54.5 between January and March and rising 0.2 points from the final 3 months of last year.
           

              
           

             Compared to Q1 last year, when 
            the Gold Investor Index set a record quarterly low of 50.5, the index has risen by 4.1 points, its sharpest four-quarter increase since the Covid Crisis of 2020.
           

              
           

             Any reading on the Gold Investor Index above 50.0 signals more buyers than sellers using BullionVault. The index set a monthly low of 47.5 last March as gold crossed above $2100 per Troy ounce for the first time, 
            spurring record-heavy profit-taking among gold investors.
           

              
           

             But with gold ending Monday almost $1000 higher, the Gold Investor Index read 54.6, exactly in line with its long-term average and down by 1.7 from February's leap to a 45-month high.
           

              
           

             So while the pace of gold's gains is rightly making headlines, 
            the upturn in gold investment demand remains very measured to date. Gold's latest run of fresh record highs continues to attract new buyers. But rather than any kind of mania, gold is still recovering from last year's low demand and profit-taking. Its appeal, like the price, could yet have much further to run if Trump's policies tip the stock-market correction into a crash.
           

              
           

             The number of new accounts opened to invest in physical precious metals on BullionVault last month slipped 4.0% from the near-4 year high seen in February. That still put it 40.5% above the prior 12-month average, led by strong growth in France, Italy, the UK and Germany.
           

              
           

             Silver prices also rose sharply in Q1, increasing by 15.5% in US Dollar terms – the fastest quarterly gain since Q4 2022 – and setting new all-time highs for UK Pound and Euro investors on a quarterly-average basis.
           

              
           

             But in contrast to gold, silver continued to meet net selling by private investors, with BullionVault users cutting their combined holdings by 13.8 tonnes since New Year (-1.2%) to the lowest by weight since December 2020 at 1,142 tonnes.
           

              
           

             By value, BullionVault clients' silver holdings rose 14.2% across Q1 to a new month-end record of $1.2 billion (£967m, €1.1bn, ¥187bn). But the Silver Investor Index, again tracking the number of buyers against sellers, halved February's 2.2 point rise in March, dropping back to 50.8 and putting the quarterly reading at 50.8.
           

              
           




              
           

             Down 1.8 points from the end of 2024, that was still 1.4 points above last New Year's record quarterly low for the Silver Investor Index, and it marks a positive balance of buyers over sellers. But only just.
           

              
           

             Trump 2.0, in short, means so far that 'safe haven' beats industrially-useful. Because while gold is finding rising and strong new demand to buy, silver demand is much softer."
2025-03-27,"Title:Gold $3000: Never More Expensive or Valuable
Article:Inflation-adjusted gold price beats Jan 1980's peak...


              
           


HOW HIGH is too high for the price of gold, or its real value?
             asks Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             First, let's ignore 
            everyone – and 
            there are 
            lots of them – claiming that gold is still under-valued simply because it hasn't yet matched the inflation-adjusted 
            gold price peak of 21st January 1980.
           

              
           

             Inflation is a monthly data point, and gold that day – spiking to $850 per Troy ounce – topped that month's average price by 25%. Whereas on a month-average basis, gold this February was worth $100 more than its New Year 1980 level in real, inflation-adjusted purchasing power terms. That was even before it broke the $3000 per ounce level in March.
           

              
           

             Gold, in other words, has never been more expensive, nor higher in real value.
           

              
           

             But does anyone ever fret about that happening to, say, the stock market? Even though the cost of buying the S&P500 price index has more than doubled in real terms from its huge Tech Stock Top of 2000...?
           

              
           




              
           

             As for the real gold price – adjusted in our chart above by the US Consumer Price Index – it's now $600 higher than Jan 1980 if we use the core PCE index instead (the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation). 
           

              
           

             Or using headline PCE (which doesn't strip out such minor cost-of-living stuff as, umm, food and fuel) gold already broke Jan 1980's monthly high back in summer 2011, peak of gold's financial crisis bull market.
           

              
           

             It's not just the Dollar gold price. Same goes for all other investors and savers in all other currencies, too. Not least here in the UK. With bells on.
           

              
           

             The longest-surviving currency in the world, the Pound has never fallen so low in terms of gold bullion, and gold has never been worth more in real inflation-adjusted terms...
           

              
           

             ...not across 8 centuries of available purchasing power data.
           


               
            


             Crunched here with a big dose of salt, today's value tops even the 15th Century's bullion famine in Europe and England's domestic catastrophe of the Wars of the Roses.
           

              
           




              
           

             Again, was 
            gold in UK Pounds only a ""buy"" until it matched those late medieval highs? Is its new record peak a reason to sell?
           

              
           

             If investors using BullionVault think so, it's only at the margin so far.
           

              
           

             Net-net, users across the 175 countries we currently serve have liquidated 85 kilos since 
            gold on 14 March 2025 first crossed through $3000 per Troy ounce. And while 
            such profit-taking in gold might sound like a lot...
           

              
           

             ...banking close to $9 million in less than 2 weeks, in fact...
           

              
           

             ...it's barely a scratch on 
            how much gold investors continue to hold, at very low cost, insured inside secure each client's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich...
           

              
           

             ...now worth a record above $4.2 billion.
           

              
           

             How come? Price in currency terms or real purchasing power is only one reason to invest in gold. Or so BullionVault users keep telling us.
           

              
           

             This New Year, in 
            BullionVault's 2025 customer survey, just over 1-in-3 respondents (34.1%) named ""Currency debasement + inflation"" as their No.1 motive for investing in precious metals.
           

              
           

             Very close behind yet again (this time on 30.1%) came ""Diversification, to spread risk from shares, bonds, property etc."" Which makes sense. Because as long-time readers of Gold News or BullionVault's 
            Weekly Update emails know with a yawn, 
            gold has repeatedly risen when the stock market sinks.
           

              
           

             So, how over-excited is gold in terms of productive business assets today?
           

              
           




              
           

             No doubt you've heard of 
            the Dow/Gold Ratio.
           

              
           

             It aims to track the value of US corporate equities in terms of bullion. The ratio simply takes the current index level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and divides it by the current price of gold per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             The DJIA, however, is 
            a flawed index to say the least. So our chart above uses the S&P500 index instead, a 
            much broader (and far more robust) stock-market measure of US-listed companies.
           

              
           

             In effect, this ratio chart shows you the price of buying corporate America in terms of the shiny but 
            mostly 'useless' precious metal. And our chart also shows you the price of gold in terms of the S&P500 as well...
           

              
           

             ...simply reversing the maths, and thereby presenting the same thing upside down...
           

              
           

             ...the better to see where stocks peaked and troughed in terms of gold, and vice versa.
           

              
           

             Now, as you can see, gold peaked in terms of US stocks back in January 1980, with one ounce equal to a massive 6.1 of the S&P500 index on average that month (and spiking to 7.6 on Monday the 21st, history fans).
           

              
           

             Stocks in terms of gold then peaked in July 1999 and again in August and September the following year...
           

              
           

             ...averaging 5.4 ounces with 1-day peaks to 5.6 and 5.5 ounces right around the S&P's cash-price top of the Tech Stock Bubble on 24 March 2000. (Happy 25th anniversary, by the way.)
           

              
           

             Whereas today? 
           

              
           

             Gold right now equals only 0.5 of the S&P500 index...
           

              
           

             ...well above 
            gold's Millennial lows beneath 0.2...
           

              
           

             ...but pretty much bang in line with the past 10 years' average...
           

              
           

             ...and less than half its long-term average of 1.1 across the past 55 years since 1970.
           

              
           

             No, none of these numbers mean much by themselves. You certainly can't (or shouldn't) try to trade them day-by-day as a signal for getting into stocks and out of gold, or vice versa.
           

              
           

             Nor does our 3rd chart above mean that gold prices can't or won't tumble from here. $3000 is a big number. Gold got there in double-quick time. When it last crossed a 4-figure threshold, 
            gold took 2.5 years to finally stop falling back through it.
           

              
           

             But in the big sweep?
           

              
           

             Yes, fund managers and advisors who never tip gold are 
            suddenly paying attention. Yes, the metal is 
            making headline across the mainstream media. And yes, consumer demand is collapsing in the face of these new all-time highs, with 
            households across Asia choosing to sell and raise cash.
           

              
           

             But those fund managers and advisors have barely begun allocating money to gold. The headlines come as Western investors remain flat net-net rather than rushing into a mania. And Asian demand – we think – is slowly transforming, edging away from bracelets and trinkets towards investment bullion as a store of wealth in the same way that Western household demand has been transformed so far this century.

             Meantime, and like the ever-prescient Gary Tanashian says in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole, ""Viewing the gold price in a vacuum, 
            some may think there is a bubble in gold. But that is far from the case"" in terms of both the stock market and investor participation right now.
           

              
           

             That said, one other thought for today.
           

              
           

             Anyone tells you ""Gold is being suppressed! Its price should be much higher!"", ignore them. Or if you feel you must engage, show them the first 2 charts above...
           

              
           

             ...and remind them that 
            across the 21st Century so far, gold is the best-performing asset by far for any investor anywhere...

2025-03-21,"Title:A Bubble In Gold?
Article:Nope. Not by a long way...

 VIEWING the gold price in a vacuum, some may think there is a bubble in gold, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 The gold price is, after all, doing this...
 
 But a bubble in gold? No.
 Just last week the gold price ticked our target of $3000+, which was established in 2020 as gold topped out and began its Handle-making phase and pattern consolidation, after making a higher right side high to its massive and bullish Cup pattern.
 Is this round number target (it was actually the Cup's measurement) a stop sign? Maybe, for a while. Maybe not. Targets are objectives, not earth shattering conclusions, and bull markets do not go straight up.
 Aside from gold's nominal price, I have frequently presented this chart of the gold price relative to the S&P500. This shows who has really been the recipient of official (Fed and government) inflationary policies since 2011, and who has not.
 
 There is no bubble in gold, as compared to the SPX.
 But in looking through nftrh.com's extensive Links page, I reacquainted myself with Macrotrends, a helpful website that holds a lot of ratio charts of various markets. It's a nice visual nerd fest. Below is one that goes well with my assertion in the chart above.
 A bubble in gold? Hardly, as compared to the bubble in Monetary Base, which is a way of saying the bubble in monetary policy. I have been assigning the real bubble dynamics to monetary and fiscal policy, with the stock market simply being bubble beneficiary #1.
 Gold, on the other hand...Palookaville.
 
 A bubble in gold?
 Here is how Macrotrends describes the ratio.
 
 Aside from making my long-standing point that gold is not primarily about inflation (as they've chronically inflated money supplies for decades), the chart tells us that the current bull market in gold is only just getting started.
 My assertion is that the break in the Continuum's decades-long disinflationary downtrend (which gave license to ongoing and chronic inflationary policies by Fed and government) is indicative of policymaking that will be handcuffed relative to recent decades, in its ability to rescue asset markets in ""business as usual"" fashion.
 
 It is not hard to imagine that the nominal gold price could move significantly higher, even if the Gold/Monetary Base chart above gets nowhere near the 4.8 level noted by Macrotrends."

WHEN your central bank hurts the economy, it's good, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault in this view sent to Weekly Update readers on Tuesday and now updated post-Fed.


              
           

             Painful, but good. Or so central bankers always say. 
           

              
           

             But if your elected government does it? Then it's bad, pure and simple.
           

              
           

             Or so the anti-Trump media keep saying. Maybe the markets are saying the same with 
            gold up above $3000 per ounce.
           

              
           

             ""The proposition that Trump's policies might hurt the economy isn't liberal propaganda,"" 
            bleats MSNBC.
           

              
           

             ""Last year, Elon Musk literally predicted his and Trump's economic policies 
            would crash the economy.""
           

              
           

             Such whining isn't new. The 'liberal media' began 
            hyperventilating about Trump 2.0 causing a recession as far back as 2023.
           

              
           

             And lo. Now the MAGA White House agrees with them!
           

              
           

             ""Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, has said Mr.Trump's policies are 'worth it' 
            even if they cause a recession,"" gasps the 
            New York Times.
           

              
           

             ""Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, has said the economy may need a 'detox period' after becoming dependent on government spending.
           

              
           

             ""And Mr.Trump has said there will be a 'period of transition' as his policies take effect.""
           

              
           

             A little pain, so much gain. Right, America?
           

              
           




              
           

             US voters may have backed Trump's MAGA platform in November. But US consumers are suddenly gloomy about MAGA-nomics.
           

              
           

             Very gloomy. Very 
            suddenly.
           

              
           

             That, at least, is what the University of Michigan's first survey report for March 2025 said last Friday.
           

              
           

             Just ahead of that news, 
            gold broke $3000 for the first time in history (if not yet the last).
           

              
           

             Longer-term, and on a 5-year horizon, the level of US consumer confidence has gone in the opposite direction to the price of gold...adjusted for US inflation...almost 80% of the time since 1978. (Our chart above inverts the real price of gold, the better to show the connection.)
           

              
           

             So more gloom *should* be great for gold. And hurrah! Here come Trump, Bessent, Lutnick and Musk to destroy jobs and growth.
           

              
           

             ""Amid signs of investor unease, the 
            Trump administration insists it aims to help Main Street, not Wall Street,"" says the 
            Washington Post...
           

              
           




              
           

             ""...but the erratic pace and tone of Trump 2.0 is taking a toll on the stable economy the President inherited...
           

              
           

             ""...denting growth prospects and leaving Americans more downbeat than they have been in years.""
           

              
           

             Boo to Trump, in other words. Re-shoring factory jobs and cutting the federal debt might sound great long term. But don't try any shortcuts. You might hurt the economy.
           

              
           

             And that tactic belongs to the central bank!
           

              
           

             ""There will be times when the Fed takes unpopular actions that cause short-term economic pain,"" 
            explains a political scientist like he's pulling a tooth.
           

              
           

             ""However, given the institution's influence over long-term economic stability, shielding it from political pressures is crucial to preventing the implementation of short-sighted policies that could lead to prolonged financial harm.""
           

              
           

             Got that? Central banks must cause recessions sometimes. It's vital that politicians don't try to stop them.
           

              
           

             Or so central banks keep saying. Y'know, kinda like 
            US courts are now whining that they shouldn't get over-ruled by the elected Government either, citing something called 'the constitution'.
           

              
           

             ""Fed's Powell Signals US Recession May Be Price to Pay"" for cutting inflation, said Bloomberg in September 2022.
           

              
           

             ""Fed needs a recession to win inflation fight,"" said an academic study in Feb 2023, a paper which senior Fed officials tried to ""quibble"" with at a seminar day that month, before agreeing ""that policymakers should accept that disinflation 
            is likely to be costly"" in terms of jobs.
           

              
           

             ""No exit ramp for Fed's Powell until he creates a recession,"" agreed CNBC in March 2023, quoting yet another economist repeating the central bankers' consensus.
           

              
           

             Never mind they were wrong. The highest US interest rates in more than 2 decades 
            coincided with inflation dropping sharply (although not as low as the Fed's 2.0% target) while failing to provoke a recession.
           

              
           

             But that's not how it's meant to go. The way that monetary policy is supposed to work, capping or curbing inflation, is by hurting the economy. Or so everyone agrees. It puts people out of work, thereby cooling consumer and industrial demand...
           

              
           

             ...taking the heat out of inflation. Which is all for the good, in the long run. Never mind if it costs you work or your business.
           

              
           

             Whereas with Trump...?
           

              
           




              
           

             Wednesday saw the Federal Reserve...led by 'high-rates' Powell...leave overnight interest rates unchanged while unveiling its latest forecasts for inflation, unemployment, the economy, and interest rates.
           

              
           

             Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve also issued its new 'dot plot' forecasts for where committee members expect US interest rates to end 2025. On average, they left that prediction at 3.9%...
           

              
           

             ...down 0.4 points from today...
           

              
           

             ...and the same forecast which the Fed's dot plot gave back in December, when it 
            hiked that prediction by half-a-point from September's guess.
           

              
           

             Simply put, rates are going to stay higher than the Fed thought on the eve of the election, and the cost of borrowing is also going to stay higher than both inflation and GDP growth, even though the Fed now thinks that the pace of US economic expansion will weaken (what with Trump in the White House and all) while it also thinks inflation will accelerate (what with Trump in the White House and all).
           

              
           

             No surprises for guessing the President's reaction to this inflation-growth stand off...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...April 2nd being 
            D-Day for Trump's raft of import tariffs on goods from pretty much every country he hasn't yet hit, plus extra tariffs on those already hit.
           

              
           

             ""He was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy,"" 
            said Trump about Powell back in 2018, mid-way through the real-estate celebrity's first term in the White House.
           

              
           

             ""It's turned out that he's not...I'm very unhappy.""
           

              
           

             15 months later, the same moan, even as the Fed began cutting interest rates.
           

              
           

             ""People are VERY disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,"" Trump said. ""The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning.""
           

              
           

             No such vitriol just yet. And to be clear: Gold hasn't cared much about Fed policy over the past couple of years.
           

              
           

             High rates failed to crush it. Falling rates failed to send it soaring anywhere close to 
            the boost which gold got from China's mini-mania last spring or 
            the approach of Trump's re-election last autumn.
           

              
           

             What's more, gold's run of fresh record highs has come as US investor demand for gold has gone AWOL, failing to rebound like Western European flows have started to do.
           

              
           

             But now that Trump has returned, he's fighting against unelected bureaucrats while smacking the political-and-economic consensus square in the face.
           

              
           

             And whatever your vote, a government that 
            openly argues with its central bank (never mind the courts or the media) pretty much demands that you buy gold 
            to protect yourself.
           

              
           

             I mean, just ask Turkey."
2025-03-20,"Title:How Hedge Fund Investing Exploded
Article:What began as a hedge became high risk...

 IT IS SAID that, in ancient Rome, triumphant generals returning home would parade around the city, writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.
 While crowds would gather – no doubt attracted by the prospect of bread and circuses – a slave stationed at his rear would whisper into the general's ear ""Memento Mori...Respice post te hominem te memento.""
 In other words: ""Remember that you, too, will die. Look to the time after your death and remember that you're only a man.""
 The medieval period is particularly rich in the memento mori in art. This correspondent has a (plastic) skull on his desk at home given at some fintech conference a few years ago for some reason. The point being, like that of the Roman slave, to remind us of our own mortality, and at the same time to remind us to make the most of the limited time we have on this earth.
 To resort to Latin for a second time: sic transit gloria mundi. How quickly the glory of the world passes away. Seize the day.
 Clients of the Tampa-based hedge fund OptionSellers.com were granted their own lesson in the transience of human affairs back in 2018, when the president of the company went onto YouTube to apologise for blowing the fund up after some ill-judged speculations in the oil and natural gas markets.
 We know neither James Cordier nor his former business, OptionSellers.com, so we can't tell whether his tears on the video are crocodilian or absolutely genuine. But we would make the following observations.
 The term 'hedge fund' used to mean something. It meant that high net worth investors sought a hedge against the inherent risk of traditional financial markets (ie, stocks and bonds) by diversifying into a form of investment vehicle that attempted to mitigate that risk. 'Hedge funds' did not start out as speculative investment vehicles, far from it. The original hedge funds were, as their name implies, looking to hedge risk, not to add to it.
 But as the hedge fund community grew in size, a seemingly endless number of greedy chancers jumped on board, attracted by the opportunity to charge clients both a 2% annual fee on assets under management and, typically, a 20% share of any positive performance on top. Just the 2% (the so-called ""carried interest"") would make any reasonably sized hedge fund manager rich, irrespective of their subsequent returns. The 20% performance share would, however, ensure riches beyond the dreams of avarice for the luckier high stakes gamblers out there.
 Volatility in the oil and natural gas markets is nothing new. What James Cordier refers to as the ship swamped by a rogue wave has happened on innumerable occasions before. See, for example, Amaranth.
 Amaranth Advisors, at its peak, was a hedge fund that had $9 billion under management. Although the fund had started out as a specialist in a strategy known as convertible arbitrage (which typically involves the purchase of convertible bonds and the simultaneous sale of related common stock), by 2005 the fund had shifted its focus onto energy trading and the natural gas market, influenced by its Canadian trader Brian Hunter.
 There's just one thing you need to know about the commodities market. It's volatile. Hunter speculated wildly in the natural gas market and ended up losing $6.5 billion.
 Long story short: hedge funds have morphed over the last 30 or so years from a relatively low risk way for wealthy private investors to diversify their portfolio risk into a Wild West of entirely unconstrained strategies ranging from conservative to ultra-aggressive, and in which the principle of 'hedging' and portfolio insurance has been cast to the winds. Given the 2% and 20% model that some hedge fund managers still use, you can hear the sound of the world's smallest violins playing just for them.
 There are no such things as 'rogue waves' in the financial markets. Or rather, if there are, then the traders blindsided by them have no fundamental understanding of the inherent wildness of markets.
 The requisite book for interested readers is Benoit Mandelbrot's The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets. The following extract is from our own book Investing Through The Looking Glass, which devotes almost an entire chapter to Mandelbrot. Investors – especially those engaging with the commodity markets – are strongly advised to consider the following of Mandelbrot's observations.
 Rule 1: Markets are riskier than we think. And certainly riskier than conventional financial theory thinks. Price movements do not happily track the bell curve. Extreme price swings are not the exception. They are the norm.
 Rule 2: Trouble runs in streaks. Or as Shakespeare put it, ""When sorrows come, they come not single spies / But in battalions!"" Market turbulence does not arise out of a clear blue sky and then disappear. It tends to cluster. A wild market open may well be followed by an equally desperate full trading session. A chaotic Monday may well be followed by an even more chaotic Tuesday.
 Rule 3: Markets have their own personality. The father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, famously created the manic depressive character Mr Market to account for the stock market's constant oscillations between greed and fear. But when individual investors, institutional fund managers, hedge funds, day traders and sovereign wealth funds come together in a real marketplace, a new kind of market personality emerges – both greater than, and different from, the sum of its constituent parts.
 Mandelbrot suggests that market prices are determined by endogenous effects specific to the inner workings of those markets, rather than by exogenous, external events. For example, his analysis of cotton prices during the last century showed the same broad pattern of price variability when prices were unregulated as they did in the 1930s when cotton prices were regulated as part of Roosevelt's New Deal.
 Rule 4: Markets mislead. In Mandelbrot's words, ""Patterns are the fool's gold of financial markets."" The workings of random chance create patterns, and human beings are pattern recognition experts. We see patterns even where none exist and financial markets are especially prone to statistical mirages. Following from this, bubbles and crashes are inherent to financial markets and ""the inevitable consequence of the human need to find patterns in the patternless.""
 Rule 5: Market time is relative. Just as the market has its own personality, so it has its own time signature. Professional traders often speak of a fast or slow market, depending on their assessment of volatility at the time in question.
 In a fast market, things like market-, stop- or limit orders have limited utility. Prices don't necessarily glide smoothly within narrow ranges. Sometimes they gap down or leap up, effortlessly vaulting beyond price limits presumed to protect portfolios from ruin.
 Traditional economists – if they've thought about the financial markets at all – have tended to treat them as a kind of closed system that obeys rigid and pre-set natural laws. Mandelbrot showed that the financial markets are altogether wilder than that. Another class of economists would recognise the inherent unpredictability of financial markets and the broader economy, and give them both the respect they deserved – the so-called Austrian School.
 Far from trying to maximise returns for our clients, we are trying to do something far subtler: participate as much as possible in the upside potential of the investment markets, while attempting to limit the downside as far as practicable. To this extent our investment objective is asymmetrical. We're not interested in simply tracking the market – if we assume, as it is for most people, that ""the market"" is essentially the market for common stocks. We're far more interested in absolute returns than market-relative ones. Unfortunately for all of us, most fund managers don't think that way.
 Don't allow exploded hedge fund managers to control the narrative. Only by understanding the risks inherent in investing (and in speculative trading) do we have a chance of navigating the squalls to come, and of our portfolios surviving them. A third of a century of working within the financial markets has convinced us that our greatest enemy is ourselves; more specifically, our genetically inherited 'fight or flight' response honed over hundreds of thousands of years has limited application in financial markets that mankind has only experienced over the last two centuries or so. Our brains have not yet had time to evolve to cope with the psychological trauma of market risk or of suddenly realised financial loss.
 At a time when many markets are struggling to find technical support, notably Big Tech stocks, and there are multiple political threats gathering on the horizon, it's worth bearing in mind that there are two component parts to equity investing. There's the underlying business which investors have fractional ownership of, and then there's the stock market, which will go wherever it wants. As equity investors, we should be most concerned by the underlying performance of the companies we own, not by the daily meanderings of the stock market. In the context of great 'value' opportunities, the only real purpose of the stock market is to create bargains for our consideration from time to time.
 Unfortunately, the underlying performance of most companies is only reported by the financial media on a quarterly basis, if that. But at the very least, it seems madness to be led by the daily gyrations of the stock market when it's the company's own profits and revenues and cash flow that actually dictate its market value over the medium term.
 Charlie Munger's famous quote about not caring when Berkshire Hathaway stock lost half its value is a typically hard-nosed articulation of this point. But he happened to be right. Equity investing can lead to terrific longer term wealth generation, but it requires a steely attitude and a willingness to buck the mood of the crowd. Not everybody has those characteristics. But then, not everybody is going to make money from their equity investments. The stock market has a tendency to shift money and profits from weak hands to strong ones.
 To paraphrase Charlie Munger, if you can't stand the heat, don't stay in the kitchen. But if you choose to leave the kitchen, chances are you will end up in the poorhouse."

Article:What is gold most used for...


              
           


IT’S OFTEN thought that gold’s value is arbitrary, or that it’s “just” decorative.
           

              
           

             But there are good reasons behind the enduring use of gold in the financial system across thousands of years, and its endurance for just as long as a luxury material for jewelry.
           

              
           

             Now, increasingly, gold’s properties of durability, malleability and conductivity are seeing the industrial uses of gold increase as new technologies develop; from aerospace to sustainable energy to computing to healthcare. Here are some of the main uses of this surprisingly versatile metal.

 Investment and finances


               Gold has long been considered a cornerstone – and sometimes the “standard” - in investment and finance, mainly due to its scarcity, resilience and stability. No longer used as a literal currency, gold still provides a store of value and can be used as an investment to hedge against inflation and economic downturns. Investors particularly turn to gold during periods of economic instability, as it tends to preserve value more predictably than other asset classes. When inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, gold often retains its worth.
             

                
             

               Central banks play a crucial role in this dynamic, maintaining substantial 
              gold reserves as part of their monetary policy. These reserves serve as a financial cushion and a source of liquidity in times of crisis. The presence of gold in the reserves can enhance trust and confidence in a country's economic stability. For an individual, the possession of vaulted bullion can provide similar confidence. Investment gold held by central banks takes the form of 400oz (12.4kg) bars with a minimum fineness of 99.5%.
             

                
             

               Unlike stocks, which can be highly volatile, or bonds, which are susceptible to interest rate fluctuations, gold offers a tangible asset that is not directly tied to the performance of companies or governments. While stocks and bonds can yield higher returns in a bullish market, gold has continued to be a popular option for diversification, risk management, and long-term security and has been the 
              best performing asset so far this century.

 Aerospace


               Gold is an increasingly valuable resource in the aerospace industry, owing to its unique properties and versatility. One of its primary applications is in the creation of reliable electrical connectors and bonding wires, where the metal’s conductivity and resistance to corrosion ensure that electrical connections remain stable and effective under the harsh conditions of space, where other metals might degrade.
             

                
             

               Gold is also used in coating aerospace components to enhance radiation shielding. In the vacuum of space, spacecraft are exposed to intense solar radiation, which can damage sensitive instruments. Gold's reflective properties help mitigate this by bouncing off harmful rays, protecting onboard equipment. The metal is also used in visors in astronauts’ helmets to provide UV protection.
             

                
             

               In thermal control systems, gold’s ability to reflect infra-red radiation is crucial in managing the temperature of spacecraft, allowing instruments to operate within their optimal ranges. This is particularly vital for missions involving satellites and space probes, which encounter extreme thermal variations. As more satellites are placed into orbit, the requirement for gold – as an indispensable element in the advancement of space technology - increases.
             


               
            
 Electronics


               Gold also plays a pivotal role in the production of electronic items. As with many other industrial uses of gold, the metal’s conductivity and reliability is key, allowing the seamless flow of electric current and ensuring efficiency in electronic circuit boards: the power behind the world’s laptops and smartphones.
             

                
             

               Gold's resistance to corrosion makes it an ideal choice for manufacturing connectors, switches, and relay contacts. Unlike many other metals, gold does not oxidize, ensuring long-lasting and stable connections. This is essential for devices that require high precision and reliability, such as computers, smartphones, and medical equipment.
             

                
             

               Gold is also used in the production of advanced microchips and semiconductors, where thin layers of gold plating are applied to silicon wafers to enhance the performance and longevity of the components.
             

                
             

               As gold does not corrode, it can be recycled from old devices to aid sustainability, estimates for the carbon footprint of recycling gold versus newly mined output vary from 1/20th to as low as 1/600th. Researchers have calculated that the cost of retrieving gold from used computer motherboards is 50 times lower than the value of the metal recovered. As technology continues to advance, the demand for gold in this sector is likely to remain strong.
             


               
            
 Dentistry and medicine


               Gold has been used within dentistry for centuries – the first ever printed book on dentistry, from 1530, provides advice on treating tooth decay, recommending cleaning the cavity and filling it with gold leaf. There is also evidence that gold wire was used to treat teeth in Ancient Egypt. By the early twentieth century, gold was the standard material used for dental fillings, implants and crowns.
             

                
             

               Gold’s malleability allows dentists to precisely shape it to fit a patient's teeth. Despite the advent of newer materials, gold remains a preferred choice for many dental restorations due to the reliability and longevity resulting from its resistance to corrosion.
             

                
             

               In medicine, gold plays a crucial role in diagnostics and treatment. Gold nanoparticles are employed in various medical applications, including targeted drug delivery and imaging techniques. These nanoparticles can be engineered to bind to specific cells or tissues, allowing for precise treatment of conditions such as cancer. Additionally, gold is used in rheumatoid arthritis treatments, where compounds like sodium aurothiomalate are administered to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression.
             

                
             

               Gold also plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of biomedical sensors - monitoring physiological conditions, detecting diseases, and guiding medical treatments - due to its excellent conductivity and ability to form stable and reactive surfaces. These properties have led to its use in the booming wearables market, as well as in more specialized medical technology.
             


               
            
 Jewelry


               Gold has been revered for its beauty and rarity, making it a symbol of wealth and status across cultures and epochs. Ancient Egyptians crafted magnificent gold pieces for pharaohs, while Indian weddings often feature intricate gold jewelry, signifying prosperity and blessings. In Western cultures, gold has been associated with milestones such as weddings and anniversaries. Its appeal seems to transcend national boundaries, making gold a universal emblem of prestige.
             

                
             

               The purity of gold, measured in karats, significantly affects its value and wearability. Pure gold is 24 karats, but its softness makes it less practical for everyday jewelry. Consequently, gold is often alloyed with other metals to enhance durability and allow it to take different forms, shades and shapes. Commonly used alloys include 18-karat gold (75% pure) and 14-karat gold (58.5% pure). Higher karats indicate higher purity and value, but lower karats provide greater resilience and affordability.
             

                
             

               With growing awareness of environmental and social impacts, ethical sourcing has become crucial in gold jewelry production and other gold metal uses. Responsible practices include fair mining conditions, minimizing ecological footprints, and supporting local communities. Certifications like Fairtrade and the Responsible Jewelry Council ensure that gold is sourced sustainably and ethically, allowing consumers to make informed choices that align with their values.
             


               
            
 Recognition


               “Gold medal” and “going for gold” are synonymous with success, and gold has long been revered as a symbol of victory and prestige. Its shine, rarity and expense make it a coveted material for recognizing outstanding achievements. In sports, gold medals and trophies are awarded to winners, most famously at the 
              Olympics, where the metal clearly outranks silver and bronze on the winners’ podium.
             

                
             

               Beyond sports, gold is widely used in military and civilian honours. Medals and badges crafted from gold are bestowed for acts of bravery, exceptional service, or notable contributions to society. These items serve as tangible reminders of their accomplishments and sacrifices, to be worn with pride and passed down through generations.
             

                
             

               Psychologically, 
              gold is associated as a reward with luxury, wealth, power, and excellence beyond the commonplace. The allure of gold as a symbol of achievement continues to inspire and reward those who excel in their endeavours.
             


               
            
 Food and drink


               Gold has no odour or flavour and is chemically inert. So, why is it increasingly an ingredient in food and drink? Edible gold leaf is used by some chefs to increase the visual appeal and prestige of gourmet dishes. Thin sheets of gold leaf now adorn chocolates, pastries, and even sushi, steaks and cheeseburgers. Gold-infused coffee, tea, and spirits are also increasingly popular, adding a touch of opulence to everyday indulgence – at a price.
             

                
             

               As gold is biologically inert and passes through the digestive system without being absorbed, it has no nutritional value, but does add a visually striking element to a dish. Gold-enhanced food and drink can provide a unique visual spectacle and caters to those seeking to indulge in a lavish treat. The use of gold as a marketing tool in high-end culinary experiences underscores its role in enhancing the perceived value and sophistication of products, and as more money is spent on luxury dining, the use of gold as an adornment has increased.
             



                
             
 Future uses of gold


                Technological advancements could allow for various future uses of gold, not all of them predictable. Gold nanoparticles are at the forefront of medical innovation, and are being explored for their potential in targeted drug delivery systems, where they can transport medication directly to cancer cells. Additionally, gold-enhanced nanotechnology is aiding in the development of advanced diagnostic tools that can detect diseases at an early stage, offering hope for more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.
              

                 
              

                Gold is emerging as a valuable component in the push towards sustainable energy, where nanoparticles are being integrated into fuel cells, increasing their efficiency and extending their lifespan. Similarly, gold is being used in the production of solar panels, enhancing electrical conductivity and overall performance.
              

                 
              

                The metal is also paving the way for breakthroughs in quantum computing. Its conductive properties make it an ideal material for qubits, the fundamental building blocks of quantum computers. Furthermore, gold's unique attributes are being harnessed in various futuristic technologies, including advanced sensors and communication devices.
              

                 
              

                Gold's future applications could extend far beyond its traditional roles, positioning it as a key material in medical, energy, and technology advancements. Its contributions are set to help shape the future, driving innovation and sustainability across multiple sectors.
              



               
            
 Uses of gold FAQs


What is gold used for in jewelry?



Gold has been used in jewelry for thousands of years primarily due to its appearance and natural lustre that doesn’t diminish over time due to gold’s inertness and resistance to tarnishing. Pure gold is relatively soft and easy to craft into delicate and intricate pieces and can also be combined or alloyed with different metals to change its colour and hardness.




What is investment grade gold?



The global wholesale gold investment market, centred in London deals in the London Good Delivery gold bullion bar. This London Good Delivery bar weighs 400 troy ounces - about 12.4 kilograms - and is about eleven inches long. It is stamped on the top (the larger face) with the manufacturer's name, the weight, and the assayed purity. The minimum specified fineness must be 99.5% pure gold, but improvements in the refining process mean that Good Delivery bars now reach 99.99% purity or higher.

2025-03-18,"Title:Gold Up, Inflation Next
Article:Same thing, in truth...

 WHEN the price of gold rises – in other words, when more money is needed to buy an ounce of gold – that usually means that the Dollar's value has decreased, writes Nathan Lewis of New World Economics, quoting his 2022 book Inflation: What It Is, Why It's Bad, and How To Fix It in this article first published at Forbes.
 Daily price movements may not be significant. But, if the price goes up and stays there for an extended period, or if it fluctuates but the general trend is up, that signals a downturn in the value of the Dollar.
 When we first wrote this in 2022, it took about $1800 to buy an ounce of gold. Today, it is more like $2900. That implies an $1800/$2900 = 0.621 or a 38% decline in Dollar value over that period.
 Prices will eventually adjust, over a period of years, to the new, lower value of the currency, with some prices moving faster and some moving slower. ""All things being equal"" (they never are but it is a good principle), we should expect a $2900/$1800 or 61% rise in prices of goods and services going forward, compared even to the inflation-boosted prices that we have had to get used to in 2022-2024.
 Compared to prices in 2018, when it took about $1200 to buy an ounce of gold, we should expect a $2900/$1200 or 141% increase in nominal prices. Doesn't seem like much fun, does it.
 This is why we say ""you can't devalue yourself to prosperity."" No country ever got rich with a weak currency. They get rich with a stable and reliable currency, which means: a currency of unchanging stable value.
 You would have to increase your nominal income by 141% just to break even. Maybe more than that, on an after-tax basis. Even if we do accomplish this, eventually, what it would mean is that we broke even, over a period of perhaps ten years. Instead of getting richer over ten years, we just made it back to flat. In other words, stagnation.
 This is basically why the Latin American countries never get anywhere. They are always just catching up to the chronic depreciation of their currencies.
 This might be confusing to some people, especially those with ""Monetarist"" leanings, and also those with ""Keynesian"" leanings – between them encompassing 90%+ of all formally-trained economists.
 The ""Monetarists"" are concerned with ""money supply"". They have a sort of narrative which goes like this:
 Expanding the money supply leads to more money chasing fewer goods, leading to rising prices. It is actually a pattern common throughout history, related to inflationary wartime finance. But, that has not been the common pattern since the Bretton Woods international gold standard era ended in 1971.
 Instead, what we tend to see is: A currency loses value, for whatever reason. Often, there is no particularly unusual ""expansion of the money supply"" going on, or any pressure from governments to somehow finance deficits with the printing press. It doesn't fit the Monetarist narrative at all – which is why they can't figure out what's going on.
 Later, as the economy reacts to this decline in currency value, nominal prices and nominal GDP tend to climb. Central banks typically ""accommodate"" this greater nominal GDP with a proportional increase in base money supply.
 During the 1970s, the whole world suffered from dramatic ""inflation"". The value of the Dollar fell from $35 per ounce during the 1960s, to around $350 per ounce during the 1980s and 1990s. It was a 10:1 or 90% decline in the value of the Dollar, compared to gold.
 Commodity prices, and prices for everything else too, verified that the decline in the Dollar vs. gold reflected a real decline in Dollar value. Oil rose from $3 a barrel in the 1960s to around $20 in the 1980s and 1990s.
 But, there was no particular ""expansion of the money supply"" going on during that whole decade. It wasn't much different than the gold standard era of the 1960s, or the disinflationary ""Great Moderation"" of the 1980s and 1990s. Government deficits were relatively small, and ""printing press finance"" was nowhere to be seen.
 During the 2000s, another major decline in the value of the Dollar vs. gold took place. From an average of about $350 per ounce during the 1990s, it fell to about $1200 in the 2012-2019 period – roughly a 4:1 decline. Commodity prices again soared higher, confirming that the Dollar's real value was indeed declining. A barrel of oil went from an average of about $20 in the 1990s to $60-$100 afterward.
 But, during this period, the base money supply grew at its lowest rate of the previous fifty years!
 I bring this up because we are again seeing the same pattern. The ""inflation"" of 2022-2024 was preceded by a gigantic increase in the base money supply of central banks, as a response to the Covid outbreak. This did amount to direct government financing, as governments ran gigantic deficits, issuing bonds that were effectively bought by central banks. It fit the Monetarist (or ""Austrian"") narrative well.
 But today, we are seeing another big decline in the Dollar's value vs. gold, with very little expansion – even some contraction – in central bank base money supply.
 This will again confuse the Monetarists and Austrians (they are easily confused), but we should recognize that this is actually a common pattern, just as we saw in the 1970s and 2000s.
 But, that's why we had to write a book about Inflation."

Article:Comex gold price breaks $3000, just like the hot-money bet...


              
           


SO the PRICE of GOLD is already through $3000 per ounce on Comex gold futures and London bullion 
            
             is barely 50 cents away right now
             has broken it too,

             Cue much excitement in the market 
            and the media. Just like we saw at $1000 in 2008 and $2000 gold in 2020.
           

              
           

             Thing is, getting to those levels gave the gold price a bad case of 'watched pot' both times. And once the gold price in Dollars broke through, it edged back...and then took a while to get there again and hold it.
           

              
           

             Eighteen months for $1000 gold. Three-and-a-half years for $2000.
           

              
           

             The $3000 level is nothing special in itself. But big round numbers have fired up the market only to spook it twice in the past. Might the same happen again?
           

              
           
 $1000 gold

             Gold flirted with $995 for 2 weeks in March 2008 before finally topping the $1000 level on the Monday morning after US investment bank Bear Stearns collapsed.
           

              
           




              
           

             But gold traded with a $1000 handle for just 3 days before the Fed's fire blanket smothered fears of contagion. Which showed up with Lehman's failure that September. It boosted the Dollar and 
            sucked speculative credit out of all markets, including gold.
           

              
           

             The price fell hard in USD (while setting new ex-Dollar highs). Then, as QE and zero interest rates fought to stem the collapse in world equities, gold traded back below $1000 for the next 18 months before decisively breaking that level.
           

              
           

             In fact, after the Bear Stearns' top, bullion prices took 369 trading days to get there again, only to flip $10 above and $10 below before finally taking out the $1000 level on the last day of September 2009 and never looking back.
           

              
           

             Well, not quite. Gold fell as low as $1045 six years later.
           

              
           
 $2000 gold

             Despite jumping 7-fold during the Tech Crash and then global financial crisis, gold missed $2000 by $80 at its 2011 peak.
           

              
           

             Bullion then took 9 years to get near that level again, when Covid sent gold prices soaring...
           

              
           

             ...because lockdowns crushed the price of useful stuff (oil futures briefly went sub-zero), whereas the ultimate safe haven was and is supremely useless for anything much beyond storing wealth and value.
           

              
           

             Perfect for the prison planet of 2020.
           

              
           




              
           

             Gaining 1/3rd from the first Wuhan cough of late November 2019, gold hit $2000 per ounce in early August 2020, but stayed there for only 4 sessions.
           

              
           

             Priced in Dollars, gold then lost $70, bounced to $2008, but took another 388 trading days to get there again...
           

              
           

             ...a feat it managed for only 2 sessions as Russia pushed towards Kyiv in its all-out invasion starting February 2022.
           

              
           

             From there, it was another 266 days before gold broke $2000 again, holding that level for almost 2 weeks before flipping below, and above, and then below 3 times in spring 2023 amid the 'mini crisis' in US tech-sector banking. 
           

              
           

             Gold then kissed $2000 goodbye yet again that May. It waited a further 132 trading days to top it in the November, only to flip and flop some more, and then finally rise above it...
           

              
           

             ...before dropping $10 below on Valentine's Day 2024...
           

              
           

             ...and then finally, FINALLY, moving to have and hold $2000 from that day forth. So far.
           

              
           
 $3000 gold

             Gold priced in Dollars began last year at $2100 per ounce, and it came into 2025 at $2600.
           

              
           

             So its year-to-date rush is dramatic, repeating most of 2024's record Dollars-per-ounce gain inside 10 weeks.
           

              
           

             What's more, and rushing higher as Donald Trump delivers exactly the policy chaos he had promised in the US election, gold set 10 new all-time Dollar price highs in February. That matches the 1-month count of <gulp> Sept 2011.
           

              
           

             But markets move opinions, of course, and bank analysts are now rushing to revise their 2025 gold price forecasts higher, if only from $3000 to $3100 for the more bullish forecasters.
           

              
           

             The speed of gold's ascent means that private investors sound equally 'meh!' with the New Year forecast from BullionVault users now looking all-too doable at $3070. That seemed a much bigger stretch when we asked back at $2600.
           

              
           

             Fast forward to mid-March and $3000 gold is just a heartbeat away (at pixel time). Which is right where the hot money wants it.
           

              
           

             Gold's hottest hot hotties love gold options, of course, because if they call it right, then each $1 staked a Comex bet can become many more. 
           

              
           

             The most active contract is now April. And can you guess what the single heaviest strike-price is by far for April Calls?
           

              
           

             Yep, $3000 per ounce. As of Thursday night, that bet accounted for 6.7% of all open Call options in Comex gold derivatives, followed by $3050 with 4.3% of open interest.
           

              
           

             In fact, more than 2-in-5 April Calls are for strikes at $3000 or above. Whereas would-be sellers now holding Puts have staked less than half-a-percent of their Open Interest at $3k or above.
           

              
           

             So what happens now that April gold futures have touched and moved up through $3000 per ounce? 
           

              
           

             The hot money's biggest bet has paid off, and those happy-clever traders will no doubt want to close their Calls and bank their profit. And if the history of $1000 and $2000 gold gives any guide, the metal might then struggle to stay there, at least at first.
           

              
           

             But does history apply here in 2025's Trumpian world?
           

              
           

             Yes, the 5 silliest words in finance always claim that ""Things are different this time"". But they really might be for gold right now.
           

              
           

             First, 
            gold has only just returned to favour among Western investors, rather than breaking $3000 amid an investing mania. Second, the crisis which investment cash is trying to protect against has barely begun.
           

              
           

             Trump uncertainty and fear mean that US stocks have so far lost only 10% from their record high of just 1 month ago. He's still got the best of 4 years in the White House. And on a 5-year horizon, as we never tire of repeating, 
            gold has always been higher when the S&P500 index has lost value. Well, very nearly.
           

              
           

             Sure, things could be different this time. But if 
            the US trade war now raises the cost of living while hurting growth like everyone expects, then the resulting stagflation will provide the perfect backdrop for investing in gold.
           

              
           

             Meantime, here's to $3000 gold and the furious re-writing of analyst forecasts it will provoke."
2025-03-12,"Title:Gold Mining Stocks Suck
Article:Gold +50% since 2011, miner stocks down 50%...

 THIS IS a response to an article on gold stocks I read, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Be aware that the writer, at Gold-Eagle, does have 22 years of fact, of proof on his side.
 His argument is that gold stocks suck, to put it technically. Those 22 years of ignominy are not to be taken lightly.
 In his Gold Stocks: Fantasy vs. Reality, Kelsey Williams points out what all gold bugs know: How bloody terrible the miners have performed vs. their product.
 So this response is not criticism. It is, however, a response with more color than just the cold hard historical facts.
 Our all-everything chart shows the fact of the matter. I am not going to over-talk it. For that you can reference Friday's article on the subject. But the ratio between the HUI Gold Miners stock index and the price of gold itself has been Ignominy-Central since 2004 and, as I noted in my article, that is for good reason.
 Gold miners should have under-performed, given the macro we had. And they did.
 
 Now, I have no bone to pick with Mr.Williams, but his article appeared just after mine, which presented the potential of a view opposite his. So why not check his assumptions?
 He starts off noting the period I noted, as well. That was 2001-2004.
 ""Alas, that three-year period of super success for gold stocks compared to gold was followed by 22 years of declining performance, thus far.
 ""The current gold stocks-to-gold ratio is 0.11, just slightly above the 0.10 mark touched in 2024, and prior to that in 2015.
 ""The reality of the decline in the ratio from 0.60 down to 0.10 is exacerbated by the fact that not only are gold mining stocks underperforming gold bullion on a long term basis, they are net losers over the past 14 years, even in the face of a sharply higher gold price.""
 Mr.Kelsey is giving us the history of it, which any committed gold bugs of that era know all too painfully well. What's more...
 ""Since the peaks for both gold and gold mining stocks in 2011, the gold price has increased by more than 50% ($1900 to $2900); whereas, gold stock prices have declined by 50%.
 ""As far as gold stocks being undervalued relative to gold bullion, well...of course they are. If they continue to underperform so drastically as has been seen, then how could they not be undervalued?
 ""Those who claim that gold stocks are undervalued mean that their prices have not gone up as much as expected, and, therefore, should increase substantially to make up for their failure to meet expectations. Good luck with that.""
 Again, history and the talk of gold stock bugs crying ""value"" is similar to when silver bugs cry ""value!"" because simply the Silver/Gold ratio is so depressed, based on distant historicals. That is not the way to measure value, so Mr.Kelsey is correct there as well.
 'Cheap' is a better word than 'value' in these cases.
 ""There are a host of reasons to not own or invest in gold stocks, except on a short-term, very speculative basis.
 ""They are underfunded operations (in most cases), subject to a host of external risk factors including labor strikes, shut downs, nationalization, etc. The biggest risk factor for most investors is the continuation of historical long-term underperformance, coupled with the risk of outperformance on the downside.
 ""The biggest declines in gold stocks come when gold and/or stocks in general fall precipitously. That has been shown clearly with gold stocks versus gold 1980-2000; and with gold stocks versus stocks in general (most recently in 2020 and 2022).
 ""Earlier this year, I included gold stocks on my list of five investments to avoid in 2025. The reason for that warning is that I believe the risks outweigh the potential rewards. I still do.
 ""If anything has changed, it is that the risks are greater now than at the time I wrote the article.""
 Again, he is citing what has been. He cites facts. These are facts I have been aware of for many years. Gold stocks sucked for a majority of the 2004-2024 period.
 Where I take issue is that he extrapolates the 2001-2022 macro into the future. There are no macro-fundamentals mentioned. No major chances in the macro backdrop. No conditions like gold now strongly out-performing the cyclical macro since 2022.
 For most of the 2004-2024 period this was not the case and hence, gold stocks had leverage alright; negative leverage.
 
 However, I am not a robotic or automatic thinker. I am a rational and hype-averse thinker, but not set in stone with it. I am also a ""what if?"" thinker. As in, what if the blow out in the 30-year US Treasury yield ""Continuum"" which I have watched for years actually meant something as I thought it did at the time (2022) and still do?
 What if it meant an end to the era of inflationary Fed policy AKA business-as-usual, circa 2003-2022...?
 
 What if that, in combination with the 2001-2004 factors shown on my first chart above and in Friday's article 2001: A Historical Odyssey For Gold Stocks, we have a macro suited to that most unexpected of occurrences, an out-performance by gold mining stocks vs. their product, developing?
 If this happens it will have taken the investing world by surprise, as Mr.Kelsey's article implies. If it happens as I think it very well may, it could be for another short 3-year phase or something longer. I do agree that gold mining positions should always be trades rather than investments. But a trade can last days and great trade can last years.
 An interim caveat to my view would be if the broad markets tank bearish for real and the gold bugs flip and lead the tank-o-rama. That is another past fact as illustrated by Kelsey Williams. So there are risks. There are always risks in all investments.
 But risk vs. reward is a thing too, and I like the RvR in a sector that almost nobody thinks will ever perform and yet has ever more beneficial macro-fundamentals developing behind it.
 The bottom line is my response is written by someone who abhors those who week after week, year after year have written bullish things about gold stocks. They are what we call promoters. Cheerleaders.
 But I have presented facts of my own that lend color to the situation. Color that asks us to at least try not to be on autopilot where a potential big winner of a trade is concerned.
 I have shown reasons why it could well be different this time. Fundamental reasons. The HUI/Gold ratio has not yet gotten off the ground, but it is something I am watching for."
2025-03-07,"Title:Silver Investing 'Goes Mainstream' at Record Ex-Dollar Prices
Article:The Economist magazine spots silver supply deficit...


              
           


With SILVER PRICES setting fresh record highs outside the US Dollar, investing in the precious metal ""is inching towards the mainstream"" reports 
            The Economist magazine as leading analysts forecast a wide deficit of supply to meet global demand for the 5th year running.
           

              
           

             Yet another new record for silver industrial demand will help offset weaker jewelry purchases – dented by silver's strong price rise – according to analysis from specialist consultancy Metals Focus for the Washington-based Silver Institute.
           

              
           




              
           

             Like silver's industrial and other productive uses – led by ""ongoing structural gains in green economy applications"" such as 
            silver's solar energy technology – silver bullion investing is forecast to rise 3% by weight in 2025, the Silver Institute says. Because ""as Western investors adjust to new price levels, fresh investment is expected to improve, and profit-taking will also ease.""
           

              
           

             Mining output will rise 2% and scrap recycling will rise 5% on Metals Focus' outlook, 
            cutting the gap between total supply and global demand by 1/5th but ""still sizeable historically"".
           

              
           




              
           

             Setting its highest annual average price since 2012 at $28.20 per Troy ounce last year, silver bullion set a new all-time annual high in UK Pounds and the Euro at £22.10 and €26.13.
           

              
           

             Silver in February then set a new month-average nominal high in Pounds Sterling at £25.68 –topping April 2011 by 1 penny – and set its highest Euro-equivalent average since the historic peak of New Year 1980 (based on the Deutsche Mark conversion rate) at €30.91 per ounce.
           

              
           

             That still left the precious metal far below those tops after accounting for inflation, at barely 1/3rd the month-average value of January 1980 in real terms.
           

              
           

             For 2025, twenty-four of the 25 analysts entering their silver-price prediction into this year's 
            LBMA Forecast Survey are bullish. The other projects that silver's average price will match 2024's decade record in Dollar terms and also foresees an intra-year peak above $40, almost 25% higher than current levels.
           

              
           

             ""Silver is to outperform all precious metals in 2025,"" says the LBMA survey's most bullish silver forecaster, strategist Nicky Shiels at Swiss bullion refining and finance group MKS Pamp.
           

              
           

             Predicting an average price of $36.50 per ounce – higher than silver's nominal 2011 record of $35.11 – Shiels points to ""synchronised central bank rate cuts, a more supportive China and US macroeconomic backdrop, still strong solar demand, and ultimately a lower US Dollar."" 
           

              
           

             Priced in the Dollar, silver has so far averaged $31.32 in 2025, and it's currently averaging £25.11 in Sterling and €30.08 in Euros.
           

              
           

             Silver also set a new annual record in Indian Rupees last year, with a fresh month-average high of 900 INR per 10 grams in February.
           

              
           

             Yet despite the industrially-useful precious metal's new price highs, Indian silver imports have jumped says Metals Focus, up 37% in January from 12 months before to the heaviest New Year inflows since at least 2008.
           

              
           

             Boosted by last summer's 
            surprise cut to silver (and gold) bullion import duty, ""This was fuelled by continued strength in investment demand,"" says the consultancy, forecasting in its latest India Focus Monthly that the subcontinent's investing should ""remain robust"" even as higher prices dent jewellery and silverware demand.
           

              
           

             For silver investment, the ""widening gulf between supply and demand 
            looks likely to keep the frenzy going,"" says this week's 
            Economist magazine, now with more than 1 million subscribers worldwide, noting the 
            recent dislocation between US Comex futures and London bullion prices.
           

              
           

             BullionVault users as well as 
            AI silver forecasts for 2025 are strongly bullish, predicting year-end Dollar prices as high as $36 per Troy ounce ."
2025-03-04,"Title:Gold Investing Jumps as Trump Chaos Deepens
Article:Most new bullion buyers in nearly 4 years...


              
           


GOLD INVESTING has leapt as Trump 2.0 delivers exactly the policy chaos which the new President promised in the US election, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault.


              
           

             The safe haven's latest surge to new record prices is seeing sentiment, demand and new accounts openings jump to multi-year highs on BullionVault, taking the value of securely-stored gold owned by investors using our 24/7 service above $4.0 billion for the first time (£3.2bn, €3.8bn, ¥606bn).
           

              
           

             With the number of new investors rising last month to the highest count since May 2021, the total number of people starting or adding to their gold holdings on BullionVault rose 33.6% from January's figure, while the number of people selling gold across the month fell 17.0% despite gold's new record prices offering fresh profits.
           

              
           

             Together that raised the 
            Gold Investor Index by 3.6 points – the strongest rise in 10 months – to 56.3, its highest reading since October 2022.
           

              
           

             The Gold Investor Index tracks the balance of gold buyers versus sellers each month, starting in 2009. It set a decade peak of 65.9 in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic went global, and it fell to a record low of 47.5 last March as gold's rising price spurred heavy profit-taking by existing owners.
           

              
           

             Any reading above 50.0 would signal that the number of buyers perfectly matched the number of sellers across the month.
           

              
           




              
           

             What's spurring this jump?
           

              
           

             Western investors are joining emerging-market central banks in buying gold as an all-weather hedge. Traders in all markets are now watching Truthsocial more closely than monetary policy.
           

              
           

             Volatility is also helping. Gold prices swung around 6% in all major currencies last month, offering longer-term holders the chance to book a profit before buying the dip alongside new investors.
           

              
           

             Priced in the Dollar, 
            gold set 10 new record high prices in February, matching the count of September 2011 – peak of the 'safe haven' metal's global financial crisis bull market – with the most since October 1978's record monthly count of 12.
           

              
           

             In Euro and UK Pound terms, gold also continued its run of new all-time highs, extending 
            2024's record count of new gold price highs in terms of those currencies.
           

              
           

             BullionVault finds 9-in-10 its 110,000 customers in Western Europe and North America. From here in Hammersmith, West London, our regular investor surveys say that BullionVault users typically hold four-fifths of their investable wealth in other assets besides precious metals. New Year 2025's survey showed that 
            geopolitics now tops the list of gold price drivers, overtaking monetary policy for the first time since Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine began in 2022.
           

              
           

             New users funding their account last month to buy bullion for the first time rose 22.4% from January's count and jumped 62.5% from its 12-month average to the biggest figure since May 2021.
           

              
           

             That was led by the UK (up 80.9% from its 12-month average to the most since March 2021), Germany (up 89.3% to the most since March 2022) and the USA (up 137.4% to the most since April 2023).
           

              
           

             So the upturn in European gold buyers 
            which we've seen and reported since the eve of the US election in October continues spreading to US investors, but from a lower base historically. 
           

              
           

             Also note that, worldwide, this jump in bullion demand remains far from a gold rush right now. While February brought the most first-time buyers to BullionVault in almost four years, that number was less than half the peak of either the Covid Crisis in August 2020 or the global financial crisis in September 2011, when gold's then-record prices set what proved to be a longer-term top.
           

              
           

             By weight in February, and net of customer profit-taking, BullionVault's 24/7 marketplace witnessed the strongest gold investor demand since June 2023 at 0.2 tonnes.
           

              
           

             More than reversing January's net outflow, that demand saw the total quantity of BullionVault clients' gold – all securely stored and insured in specialist warehouses in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich – rise to a 3-month high above 44.1 tonnes. Up 0.4% from January's 4.5-year low, client gold holdings increased 1.1% to the 9th new all-time record of the past 12 months, rising above $4.0 billion for the first time.
           

              
           




              
           

             After falling below 50.0 in January to signal more sellers than buyers for the 5th time in 12 months, the Silver Investor Index rose 2.2 points to read 51.9 in February.
           

              
           

             By weight, however, BullionVault users were net sellers of silver, cutting their holdings as a group for the first time in 4 months and liquidating almost 5 tonnes as the more industrially-useful precious metal set new month-average records in UK Pounds and most other non-US currencies outside the Euro. That took total client holdings down 0.4% by weight to 1,151 tonnes worth $1.1bn (£915m, €1.1bn, ¥173bn).
           

              
           

             Precious metals investing, in other words, currently favors the safe haven of gold over the industrial-growth story of silver. But while that matches the geopolitical and economic outlook as Trump 2.0 turns eight decades of Western military and trading alliances on their head, investor sentiment is positive towards both precious metals as they trade at new all-time record prices."
2025-02-19,"Title:So, About That Fort Knox Gold Thing
Article:No, Mr.Bond. I expect you to audit...


              
           


SIXTY YEARS AGO, just as the fictional 007 was thwarting Auric Goldfinger's plan to empty Fort Knox and take America's gold to Soviet Moscow, the US Treasury feared a very genuine loss of its real gold reserves, writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.
           

              
           

             ""My God, this is the time...
           

              
           

             ""If everyone wants gold we're all going to be ruined, because there is not enough gold to go around.""
           

              
           

             So said US President John F.Kennedy to then-chair of the Federal Reserve, William McChesney Martin in 1962.
           

              
           

             The Cold War risked getting very hot amid the Cuban missile crisis, and gold's role as the ultimate asset of national power was being challenged by plutonium. But for monetary power, it remained the ultimate currency, and while America's giant hoard had already shrunk from its World War 2 peak, the mid-1960s saw almost one-half of all the gold ever mined sitting inside government vaults.
           

              
           

             What put it there? What kept it locked up?
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Fear, Mr.Bond, takes gold out of circulation and hoards it against the evil day.
           

              
           

             ""In a period of history when every tomorrow may be the evil day, it is fair to say that a fat proportion of the gold dug out of one corner of the earth is at once buried again in another corner.""
           

              
           

             So says Colonel Smithers of the Bank of England to double-oh!-seven in Ian Fleming's 
            Goldfinger (1959). The monetary facts were more prosaic, but the real-world crisis was no less dramatic.
           

              
           

             Back in the third quarter of the 20th Century...back before 
            the 'end of history' marked the 'end of gold' for European central banks enjoying the victory of Western capitalism over Soviet communism...the almighty Dollar supported the world's entire monetary system under the Bretton Woods Agreement signed as the US-led Allies pushed towards Berlin in 1944.
           

              
           

             Every other major currency was valued in terms of the greenback, and gold in turn backed the Dollar. Or rather, it backed 25% of the dollars in issue, as per the Federal Reserve Act.
           

              
           

             So it was only by holding either gold or dollars (or better still, lots of both) that sovereign governments could hope to settle their international spending and debts with each other.
           

              
           

             ""Gold and currencies backed by gold [became] the foundation of our international credit,"" as Bond is briefed by Smithers in 
            Goldfinger.
           

              
           

             ""We can only tell what the true strength of the Pound is, and other countries can only tell it, by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency.""
           

              
           

             Sitting atop this system...the ""Gold Exchange Standard"" as it's sometimes known...the US Dollar clung onto its position as the world's No.1 currency thanks to the sheer size of US national gold reserves. They'd risen three times over between the mid-1920s and the defeat of Japan 2 decades later, hitting more than 20,000 tonnes by the late 1940s.
           

              
           

             At its peak, America's nationalized gold reserve – the single greatest gold hoard on Earth – accounted for almost one-in-four-ounces ever mined in world history. But being the King makes it tough to sleep some nights, and for most of the Bretton Woods period, from the end of WWII until 1971, Washington tossed and turned.
           

              
           

             Because if the US gold reserve fell, transferring real wealth overseas, it risked taking the Dollar's position as ""top dog"" along with it.
           

              
           

             ""We now have $21 billion worth of refined uranium and plutonium,"" said a desperate Dwight Eisenhower at a meeting with his senior White House advisors on 9th November, 1960. ""This has great future value as a source of power,"" not least because it now topped the market-value of America's national gold holdings.
           

              
           

             So ""could it be substituted for gold?"" the President asked, proposing a new bed-rock for US monetary reserves and, therefore, for the world.
           

              
           

             Eisenhower's question – though bone-headed and ""politely dismissed"" as Francis Gavin relates in his excellent 2004 history, 
            Gold, Dollars & Power – was urgent. America's nuclear arsenal already supported its political power. Could plutonium sustain US monetary might as well?
           

              
           

             Well...no. ""The great thing to remember about gold,"" as Colonel Smithers goes on in 
            Goldfinger, ""is that it's the most valuable and easily marketable commodity in the world."" That still holds true today, six decades later.
           

              
           

             Wholesale gold bullion – traded by professional dealers, refineries, bullion banks, central banks, and private investors choosing to use BullionVault – represents one of the world's deepest and most liquid capital markets.
           

              
           

             There is always a ""clearing price"" at which buyers and sellers will trade. Because gold's intrinsic value, the fact that it stores wealth in itself, rather than by deferring that value to some other asset, promise or production, is its only utility.
           

              
           

             Industrial and medical uses barely count against the volume of gold held for its wealth-content alone. Whereas money backed by uranium, crude oil, plutonium or copper would be instantly trumped by their value as industrial assets – rare and valuable items, to be sure, but valued for their productive uses instead.
           

              
           

             Back in November 1960, meantime, Secretary of State Christian Anderson had called that meeting at Eisenhower's White House meeting because the government-owned US gold reserve...
           

              
           

             ...fixed vs. the Dollar at an unchanging value of $35 per ounce since 1933...
           

              
           

             ...was about to slip below $18 billion ""for the first time in many, many years.""
           

              
           

             That was a lot of money in those days, but too little for comfort. Why?
           

              
           




              
           

             As the chart shows, the mid-1960s found 
            America's balance of trade tipping into a deficit.
           

              
           

             It has rarely looked back. Because the USA still gets to pay the world in Dollars... 
           

              
           

             ...and those Dollars ""[are not] an impartial and international trade medium [but] in fact 
            a credit instrument reserved for one state only,"" as French President Charles de Gaulle spat in 1965.
           

              
           

             So France (and Germany, among others) kept demanding gold rather than accepting US Dollars at face value and sitting on paper in payment. That was their right under the post-WWII Bretton Woods Agreement...
           

              
           

             ...a right exercised whenever the supply of dollars looked likely to force a revaluation of its gold backing...
           

              
           

             ...and a right finally lost when 
            Richard Nixon stopped redeeming dollars for gold in August 1971.
           

              
           

             Nixon's decision to 
            float the entire world off gold and onto pure faith alone is often seen as a ""crime"", an affront to fair dealing and honest money which is 
            to blame for, well, everything you can think of. And Nixon certainly stuffed America's creditors, devaluing the Dollar by 100% compared with the promised ratio of $35 an ounce. Runaway inflation then followed as US dollars flooded the world, lacking any ""hard asset"" backing to limit their growth.
           

              
           

             In less than a decade, the gold value of US dollars sank by 96%, pushing the gold price up to a peak of $850 per ounce. Gold has of course gone higher again since 1980, topping $2900 for the first time ever this month.
           

              
           

             But in closing the ""gold window"" at the Federal Reserve – and thereby destroying the Bretton Woods exchange standard – Nixon was only completing a process begun before the First World War started in 1914.
           

              
           

             Yes, Tricky Dicky locked up America's gold reserve from foreign governments demanding hard assets in payment of debt. But more crucially in the great arc of monetary politics, Nixon also pushed US gold farther away from private circulation. Barring the US Treasury's late-1970s sales, in fact, he effectively made those reserves vanish from the face of the Earth.
           

              
           

             ""In the Ian Fleming novel,"" writes 
            Francis Gavin – then a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, now at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies – ""the sinister Goldfinger, ably assisted by Pussy Galore, plotted to steal the American gold supply from Fort Knox.
           

              
           

             ""The movie [of 1964] added an interesting twist to the book's improbable scenario...Goldfinger tells agent 007 that he does not have to remove the gold physically. Instead, he only needs to get inside Fort Knox and install a timed nuclear device supplied by the People's Republic of China.
           

              
           

             ""The bomb would irradiate all the gold inside the building and make it unusable...international liquidity would seize up, and the Western trade and monetary systems would collapse."" It would also make the gold-mad Goldfinger's own personal stockpile of the stuff infinitely more valuable.
           

              
           

             Luckily for the free world, James Bond and Pussy Galore team up at the end of the film to thwart Goldfinger's plan, de-arming the bomb and leaving America's national gold hoard intact.
           

              
           

             But in reality, Richard Nixon achieved nothing less than Goldfinger's evil scheme in August 1971...and without the fruity charms of Pussy Galore as encouragement.
           

              
           

             Nixon's decision to halt the outflow of nationalized US gold kept it both safe and secure from foreign powers, and also safe and secure from free circulation outside of government vaults. In effect it was irradiated, put beyond human reach and removed forever from the world's available stock of physical bullion.
           

              
           

             So what if it's not there?
           

              
           




              
           

             As you might guess from the story so far, all the causes, issues and challenges around America's giant gold reserve aren't very simple.
           

              
           

             But that doesn't mean the richest man in the world can't 
            reduce it all to a meme grabbed from TV cartoon South Park...
           

              
           

             ...hurr-hurr...
           

              
           

             ...nor that stopped-clock clowns can't reply with the 
            equally vacuous yet heart-sinkingly inevitable 2020s' riposte:
           

              
           

             ""Bitcoin fixes this.""
           

              
           

             Oh good grief. How did it come to this?
           

              
           

             ""It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there,"" said the X.com handle of financial scuttlebutt website ZeroHedge on Saturday.
           

              
           

             ""Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974.""
           

              
           

             ""Surely it's reviewed at least every year?"" replied the space-and-electric-car mogul now tasked with 
            
             firing everyone
            
chasing down inefficiency in the US government.
           

              
           

             ""Nope. Let's do it,"" chipped in Republican Senator Rand Paul. His dad Ron has been calling on the feds to allow (if not run) an audit of the US Treasury's alleged gold holdings since, well, forever.
           

              
           

             Whether or not the gold is all there should matter, of course. Elon Musk is hunting out corruption and fraud across the US government. A big hole in the US gold reserves would be bad.
           

              
           

             But really, what use is that gold anyway? 
           

              
           

             ""It'd be nice for the American people to know whether or not the gold is there,"" said Ron Paul in 2010 during one of his regular calls for Fort Knox to be audited.
           

              
           

             Is nice a good enough reason?
           

              
           

             ""The secrecy has given rise to a number of theories about the gold at Fort Knox and other depositories,"" Paul the Elder went on the following year when demanding an audit yet again.
           

              
           

             ""Some people speculate that the gold has been involved in gold swaps with foreign governments or bullion banks, others believe that the gold has secretly been shipped out of Fort Knox and sold, and still others believe that the bars at Fort Knox are actually gold-plated tungsten.""
           

              
           

             Okay. But what level of audit would properly over-turn such chatter?
           

              
           

             An audit alone is meaningless. Paper records have been 
            checked against paper records many times, as recently as 2023.
           

              
           

             No, what you need instead is 
            what BullionVault users get every year...
           

              
           

             ...which is a full inspection and tally-count, checking that all the bars listed on our 
            Daily Audit (which confirms each working day that the sum total of client holdings matches the sum total of bullion listed on the independent vault operators' records) are present, secure, and in sound condition.
           

              
           

             Thing is, because BullionVault users own a lot of gold (and lots more silver, plus some platinum and palladium...now worth north of $5 billion all told), this takes the independent experts we employ on your behalf many, many days to complete. It's not cheap. But as a belt-and-braces process to confirm that your metal is where it should be, in full, it is vital.
           

              
           

             Few competitors bother (especially those who claim to keep metal in their own store-room, rather than using independent specialists for custody to reduce the obvious risk of fraud). Hardly any gold-backed ETFs go to the trouble of having each and every bar checked either. Instead, they do only a 'sample' count and inspection. Which is what the US Treasury got for its Fort Knox holdings 
            last time they were checked too, back in 1974.
           

              
           

             That sampling, of course, was because the USA's apparent gold holdings were (and are) massive, the biggest in the world, well over twice the size of (current, official) No.2 Germany. So a full count and inspection would take a very, very long time. But it might feel important if you want to push ahead and audit every branch of government in full. Most especially if you want all of those 8,133 tonnes of (reported) gold to be ready for sale...
           

              
           

             ...y'know, just in case the end of the world arrives...
           

              
           

             ...or more practically, in case you want to revalue the gold reserve to squeeze a few extra dollars out of the Treasury's arrangement with the Fed.
           

              
           




              
           

             Under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, the Federal Reserve 
            handed ownership of all its gold to the Department of the Treasury.
           

              
           

             In exchange, the Treasury then issued certificates to the Fed for the value of the gold, which the Fed could then give to the Treasury in cash. Neat!
           

              
           

             But the value of this accounting trick remains stuck at the Treasury's 1973 gold valuation of $42.22 per Troy ounce...
           

              
           

             ...the official gold price frozen in time when the US and its allies finally gave up pretending that the Bretton Woods system still existed, two years after Richard Nixon shot it dead...
           

              
           

             ...whereas gold in the open market today commands a price of $2900 per ounce.
           

              
           

             Cue much excitement around revaluing the US gold reserve to raise $747 billion at the stroke of a pen (albeit following a Congressional vote).
           

              
           

             Cue much chatter about what that accounting trick might mean for the market-price of gold...
           

              
           

             ...plus much gasping around how selling some of that gold outright would crash the market. 
           

              
           

             ""For the mark-to-market change to have any impact,"" says one know-nothing rent-a-quote answering the phone to 
            Fortune magazine 
            through the seat of his pants, ""the US would presumably need to sell off some of its gold reserves for cash.
           

              
           

             ""It's going to be like Armageddon if they try to dump any significant amount of gold,"" 
           

              
           

             Oh good grief. Marking-to-market would need zero gold selling, not ""presumably"" or otherwise. It would raise exactly the sum of cash which selling the whole lot at $2900 would achieve, minus the $11 billion already booked under the $42/oz valuation.
           

              
           

             This sounds a smart idea. Smarter by far than stretching the US Mint's authority to spit out 
            a platinum coin with ""$1 trillion"" stamped on its face. Which was the last monetary-metal accounting trick 
            proposed with a straight face by the charlatans, chancers and Fed research team.
           

              
           

             But as our chart above shows, monetizing the US gold reserve at today's prices wouldn't do much to clean up the United States' fiscal mess.
           

              
           

             That's the only real lesson worth noting from the current hoo-ha around America's nationalized bullion stock.
           

              
           

             The biggest hoard of gold in the world...
           

              
           

             ...valued at the highest gold prices in history...
           

              
           

             ...isn't enough to cover 4 months of the gap between the federal US government's income and spending.
           

              
           

             Little wonder gold prices keep going higher, hitting 
            the 11th new all-time gold high in Dollar terms of 2025 already on Wednesday, as foreign creditors and private wealth seek an alternative store of value to American debt.

Article:Will human forecasts or AI predictions prove most accurate for precious metals in 2025...?


              
           


GOLD came into 2025 at new record highs in all major currencies, beating the 12-month price gains in silver, platinum, palladium and most other commodities, plus the stock market, as well as outstripping professional and private-investor price forecasts too.
           

              
           

             While a gold price forecast from artificial intelligence tools (AI) came closest, BullionVault users as a group came ahead of professional estimates, and those investors are now bullish again for the year ahead. Over 1,440 respondents to our latest outlook survey on average predict a price rise in gold to $3070 price per Troy ounce by the end of December 2025.
           


               
            

              At the end of last year, the average price of gold in Q4 was $2644, meaning that our users' estimate for 2024 was only off by 13.6%, much more accurate than the professional analysts polled by bullion market trade body the LBMA, but not as accurate as Google’s Gemini AI forecast.
            

               
            

              The 
             2024 AI gold price predictions and results were so interesting, we decided to repeat the analysis for 2025, extending this AI experiment to add Perplexity, Meta AI and Claude AI to Google’s Gemini and the updated ChatGPT-4 Turbo.
            

               
            

              We tasked these five well known AI tools with predicting the average quarterly prices in 2025 and will compare their forecasts each quarter throughout the year.
            

               
            

              As you can see below, we will also compare these natural language processing tools against the very human forecasts from BullionVault users, as well as from professional forecasters at bullion banks, brokerages and specialist consultancies.
            

               
            

              Who will prove to be the most accurate forecaster at the end of 2025: human investors, human experts, or AI machines?

             Clearly, ChatGPT-4 Turbo and Google's Gemini are far more bullish in their gold price prediction than Perplexity, Meta AI and Claude AI. They're also significantly more optimistic about gold than BullionVault users, who were asked to forecast gold's price at the end of the year.
           


               
            

              Our December 2024 survey of 1,443 precious-metal investors (who say they typically hold 76% of their investable wealth in other assets) found that over 31% believed geopolitics such as the Middle East conflict or Russian/Ukraine war or US-China tensions would have the greatest impact on gold prices from January to the end of December 2025. Government spending and monetary policy were identified as the next biggest factors to impact the predicted gold price (20.8% and 16.8% respectively).
            

               
            

              Will that prove to be useful insight this year? Twice a year we 
             survey investors using BullionVault for their opinions on where precious metals prices will be at the end of the next December, plus what factors will have the biggest impact on those prices.
            

               
            

              For instance, in December 2023, when gold was trading at $2029 per Troy ounce, our survey respondents predicted that the price would reach $2342 twelve months later. That was a little conservative when you consider the gold price averaged $2644 for the month in December 2024 and Google’s Gemini gold prediction was a mere 0.4% out.
            


              
           
 Gold price forecast FAQs:


Will gold prices go up?



Predicting the short-term price of gold is always a challenge, because many factors influence the price day to day, from geopolitical tensions to central bank interest rates, inflation, exchange rates and stock market performance.
In the short to medium term the price of gold rises and falls. However, if you look at the gold price over 10-year periods in USD or GBP, there is a clear direction to the chart and gold has been the best performing asset this century.




What is the gold price forecast for the next 5 years?



Because so many factors influence the price of gold, predicting the next 5 years between 2025 and 2030 is difficult. Even professional bullion market analysts polled by the LBMA rarely get annual price movements right, let alone gold price predictions over 60 months.
Among the factors affecting a gold price projection, geopolitical tensions can create uncertainty, driving investors towards gold as a safe haven. Central bank interest rates impact the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, while inflation affects the purchasing power of currencies, potentially increasing gold's appeal as a store of value. Exchange rate movements impact gold's relative value across different currencies. Additionally, stock market performance often has an inverse relationship with gold prices, as investors may shift between equities and precious metals based on risk appetite. In 2024, for instance, global stock markets rose, with the S&P 500 rising 25% vs gold's 27% increase.
These diverse and dynamic variables shape gold's daily price movements, making short to medium term predictions challenging. Looking back 5 years to February 2020 in either USD or GBP, there were many periods when the gold price fell and then recovered, with a significant and sustained price increase running from New Year 2024 through to today. This illustrates how difficult it is to make gold price predictions over the short term.
However, gold is by far the best-performing asset of the 21st Century to date.




Can gold prices decline?



Gold prices can and will go down as well as up minute by minute. Longer term, if you look at a gold price chart for the past 5 years to 2025, there were periods when the general trend of the gold price was down as well, albeit with short-term spikes. That didn't reverse gold's underlying uptrend in value.
Conversely, within the same time frame, there were periods where the gold price was generally trending upwards yet there were still dips as the gold price dropped over several weeks or months before recovering.
Identifying dips when the gold price falls and spikes can provide opportunities to buy, sell and take profit from trading gold just as in any other investment market.

             As with the gold price, the AI silver predictions gathered by BullionVault generally forecast significant rises by the end of 2025, with ChatGPT-4 Turbo forecasting a potential high for silver of between $46 and $56 per ounce, eclipsing the all-time high of $49.45 reached in January 1980.
           

              
           
 Silver price forecast FAQs:


Will silver prices go up?



There are many reasons to be bullish on the price of silver in 2025. Already the 3rd best performing asset so far this century, silver in contrast to gold finds more than half its demand from industry, where it is used in everything from photovoltaic solar panels to healthcare and electronics in every sector.
Globally, industrial demand for silver set a new record by weight in 2024, and forecasts see that demand remaining strong this year, helping support silver investing prices even amid short-term dips or drops in value.




What is the silver price forecast for the next 5 years?



Because silver has so many industrial uses today but also enjoys a long history as a monetary metal, the outlook for silver prices over the next 5 years will likely be tied to global economic growth as well as the performance of gold prices.
If the growth being forecast for solar energy, electric vehicles, electronics, military and other machinery proves correct over the next 5 years, then silver industrial demand is predicted to grow further, boosting the silver price.




Can silver prices decline?



Day-to-day, silver prices typically behave like gold but with greater volatility, both up and down. That can result in steeper losses of value for anyone investing in silver when the price drops, as looking at a silver price chart will confirm.
Longer term, silver has underperformed the price of gold, perhaps because it doesn't enjoy the demand from central banks which has helped drive the 'safe haven' precious metal higher. But analysts agree that silver's fast-growing industrial demand should continue to support and boost silver prices.
Silver's versatility and value to industry can't be overstated. 25 years ago the biggest use for silver was in photography, however since the incredible rise of digital cameras and mobile phones, the amount of silver used in the photographic industry has diminished by 90%. If there had not been replacement industrial uses for silver, such as in solar panels, it is logical to expect that the silver price would have fallen significantly in line with that key part of demand.

              Looking at the price of platinum, Google’s Gemini's 2025 prediction shows a very wide spread between low and high levels, clearly indicating a lack of confidence in the AI tool's own grasp of the factors influencing the platinum market. While Gemini is hedging its bets on where the platinum price will end 2025, the other AI models have far tighter low-to-high forecasts. Across all the Artificial Intelligence projects surveyed by BullionVault, the consensus forecast is that the platinum price will likely reach $1000 per ounce. 
            

               
            

              BullionVault users concur and also predict the price of platinum will reach $1037 by year end.
            


              
           
 Platinum price forecast FAQs:


Will platinum prices go up?



Platinum prices have lagged gold and silver in recent years, going down harder and failing to go up as quickly. Only a low gain for the price of platinum is now forecast for 2025 by professional analysts. So platinum could offer a contrarian investment.
Dragging on platinum prices in recent years has been the rise of electric vehicles, because the precious metal finds its largest single use in diesel-engine autocats. Yet the actual level of platinum demand from the auto sector has not been going down. That means the drop in platinum mining output could support and boost prices in future, especially if the use of platinum in hydrogen fuel-cell technology continues to grow.




What is the platinum price forecast for the next 5 years?



A platinum price prediction for 2025 or beyond needs to consider how far new mining supply will fall behind industrial demand for the white precious metal, most of all in autos and hydrogen energy. That's because this deficit in platinum supply versus demand is what precious-metals insiders believe will stem its long-term underperformance and boost its underlying industrial and investment value.




Can platinum prices decline?



Like any asset or commodity, platinum changes in price minute to minute, going down or up no matter the underlying price trend. But with the cost of mining an ounce of platinum now so close to the bullion market price, it's worth considering how that could provide a floor to the value of platinum, helping support if not prevent a further decline in platinum prices.

              Does Gemini know something that the other AI engines and BullionVault users do not about the future palladium price? Or is there simply not enough data on the internet regarding palladium for Gemini to be confident about predicting a tighter price range?
            

               
            

              That said Meta AI has clearly used a similar data source to Gemini to forecast the palladium price potentially hitting $1900, which is more than double Claude AI’s incredibly low prediction of ending the year at $900, less than the current Q1 price.

 Palladium price forecast FAQs:


Will palladium prices go up?



Forecasts about whether the price of palladium will go up or down this year are tied to predictions for the level of demand for the precious metal relative to supply. The investing outlook tends to focus on how much palladium's price will be hurt or boosted by the balance of bullion coming into and going out of the market.




What is the palladium price forecast for the next 5 years?



Palladium price forecasts have typically been too bullish in recent years, and the outlook from 2025 to 2030 remains uncertain. Analyst predictions point to 'over supply' in the market relative to demand, mostly for autocatalysts in gasoline engine vehicles.




Can palladium prices decline?



After falling for 2 years running, palladium prices stopped declining in 2024, albeit with the precious metal's lowest annual average price since 2017. Palladium could of course go down further from here, and investing sentiment remains very bearish.

             Referring to Trumpcoin, the technical analysts at Northstar made the following observation:
           

              
           

             ""Up 5,000% then down 50% in 36 hours. I'm really not sure about the wisdom or ethics of putting your name on a thing like this.""
           

              
           

             As one of our regular 'State of the Markets' podcasts, with Paul Rodriguez, we recently had the opportunity to discuss the state of the investment world with longstanding friend Tony Deden.
           

              
           

             Our friend Ronnie Stoeferle of wealth managers Incrementum has been helpful enough to provide an abridged 'bullet point' summary of the conversation, which is published – with Incrementum's approval – below. A link to the original interview then follows.
           

 Unconventional Start: Tony did not begin his career in traditional finance. He studied mathematics and chemistry, and worked as an acquisitions analyst. His entry into finance was driven by a desire to protect a family's capital.
 Learning Through Practice: Tony's knowledge of finance came from reading and practical application, not from formal financial training. He was motivated by a fear of poverty and doing something wrong, rather than by the pursuit of wealth and fame.
 Value Investing Influences: He was significantly influenced by the value investing approach. He also developed an early fascination with economic phenomena, seeking to understand money, interest rates, and how the world operates.
 Focus on Avoiding Errors: Tony emphasizes avoiding errors, rather than focusing on achieving big wins. He believes that understanding why companies fail is crucial. He views deploying capital like playing tennis, focusing on not making errors, rather than scoring goals.
 Human Element in Business: Tony believes the human element is the most significant factor in corporate failure. He prefers investing in mediocre companies with great people rather than great companies with mediocre people. He also looks for factors that contribute to a company's longevity. Critique of the Financial System.
 Markets as a Means: Tony sees financial markets as a means to an end, similar to a vegetable market for a chef. The market itself is not the goal, but rather a tool for finding quality at the right price. He is more interested in the real economy and those who produce goods.
 Rejection of Market-Driven Investment: He finds the investment industry too focused on outperforming markets and satisfying the wishes of those they serve. He thinks the practice is rooted in the needs and expectations of clients and the motivations of those serving them. Tony believes that comparing oneself in terms of money is problematic because people's aims and means differ.
 Critique of Financial Metrics: Tony is critical of measuring everything with money, especially since the nature of money itself is not fully understood. He believes the financial industry uses money as a tool without understanding its true nature. He argues that financial accounts were originally intended for accountability, not valuation.
 Money as Debt: Tony views the current financial system as problematic because money is essentially debt. He also finds inflation a difficult concept even for economists, and believes that the rise in asset prices is similar to the rise in prices of goods.
 Misallocation of Capital: He is concerned that money going to the stock market doesn't necessarily lead to more production or wealth. He believes that the focus on stakeholder capitalism has damaged society, money, and savings.
 Impact of Low Interest Rates: Low interest rates create a culture of speculation, forcing people to seek returns in the stock market, which he sees as a poor measure of economic health. Investment Approach.
 Focus on Companies and People: Tony focuses on understanding companies and the people behind them. He is not interested in simply watching markets rise and fall.
 Key Considerations: He considers three main questions when evaluating a business: Do I understand the business? Do I like the business? What is the motivation of the people behind it?
 Importance of Understanding: He emphasizes understanding the business, its risks, customers, and relevance. He avoids businesses that rely too much on external forces, such as airlines or banks.
 People and Motivation: Tony seeks to understand the motivation of the people behind a business, asking if they own the business with their own capital or through options. He also looks at whether they are in it for the long term and whether they focus on the factory floor or on Wall Street.
 Valuation After Understanding: Tony believes in assessing a business thoroughly before looking at financial accounts. The value is subjective and financial metrics can be misleading.
 Subjective Value: Tony emphasizes that value is subjective and interpreting value in one's own context has helped many make progress.
 Rejection of Formulas: He is against making mathematical formulas out of the notion of value. Economic and Societal Concerns.
 Challenging Environment: Tony views the current environment as very challenging for business owners due to the destruction of money and savings.
 Consequences of Mismanagement: He warns of the consequences of governments inflating away debt and printing money.
 Culture of Consumption: He believes that society has become a culture of consumption, rather than production, and we are eating the seed for tomorrow.
 Universal Disintegration: He sees a universal disintegration in the Western world, and thinks the vast bulk of people are being impoverished. The middle class has been destroyed in the Western world.
 Decline in Birth Rates: He notes the decline in birth rates in advanced economies, as it has become too expensive to start a family.
 Destruction of Money: He suggests that the destruction of money has led to the destruction of society. He points out that, in the past, families could be supported by one income, but that saving is no longer prioritized.
 Need for Failure: Tony believes failure is necessary to bring about a rejuvenation in ideas.
 Loss of Trust: He highlights a loss of trust in institutions, governments, and corporations. Tony believes trust is essential for progress in society.
 Rejection of State Monopoly: Tony believes that money should be independent of the state and have its own substance. He also doubts there will be a reduction in the size of government in the West. Other insights:
 Capital Allocation: Tony highlights the importance of capital allocation decisions for business owners, mentioning that they have to choose between investing in new equipment, hiring more people, or other options.
 Gold: Tony owns gold not as an investment, but because he sees it as having independent value and scarcity.
 Independence, Scarcity and Permanence: The three key characteristics of a successful investment.
 Investment Practice vs. Business: He emphasizes that his work is a practice, not a business. Tony distinguishes between an investment practice, which seeks to do the right thing, and an investment business, which seeks to satisfy the customer.
 Selectivity: Tony says that when selecting people to participate with them, they are very picky, looking for people who share the same values, have earned their wealth, and have a long-term time preference.

2025-02-10,"Title:Silver Investing in the 21st Century
Article:No.3 asset beats platinum + palladium on solar...


              
           


CENTRAL BANKS, investment access, fear, 
            says Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             If you've read our 2 previous notes on the 21st Century so far, you'll know those 
            3 factors made gold the No.1 investment since New Year's Eve 1999. Plus 
            China and India, of course.
           

              
           

             So what about silver or the twin precious metals of platinum and palladium?
           

              
           

             By the start of 2025, silver had risen 493% since New Year's Eve 1999.
           

              
           

             That compares with gold's 819% in Dollar terms...
           

              
           

             ...and it wins silver a top 3 finish across the first quarter of this century, just behind the US stock market.
           

              
           




              
           

             But while gold set its latest all-time Dollar highs last autumn, with ex-Dollar prices hitting new records already in 2025, silver peaked back in 2011 at $50 per ounce.
           

              
           

             Some analysts now see a record year ahead for the 'devil's metal'. But it's still 40% below that all-time high right now.
           

              
           

             What's more, demand from central banks...
           

              
           

             ...a key turnaround in gold's fortunes since Millennium Eve...
           

              
           

             ...can't explain silver's strong 21st Century to date, as Matt Turner of Anglo American noted at 
            the LBMA seminar on this topic I chaired in December. Because no central bank buys silver as a reserve asset today.
           

              
           

             Maybe that explains the performance gap between gold and 
            silver prices?
           

              
           

             Or maybe central banks did help silver, as Matt suggested, because their gold demand helped drive up silver prices by association.
           

              
           

             Either way, 
            the Gold/Silver Ratio has risen, suggesting that investors and consumers since the start of 2000 have sought safety of the yellow metal, driving its premium higher.
           

              
           




              
           

             Reaching 86 as 2024 drew to a close, the price of gold in terms of silver ended the 20th Century at 54, having already risen from its start-1900s level of 35.
           

              
           

             The underlying direction has been higher as well, with the Gold/Silver Ratio averaging 68 over the past 25 years after reading 57 on average between 1975 and 1999.
           

              
           

             But if silver's investment and monetary appeal has looked dull if not tarnished next to gold, its strong and ever-growing tech stories are increasingly important, said Suki Cooper of Standard Chartered at 
            Christmas 2024's LBMA seminar.
           

              
           

             From 
            PV to EVs, defense to AI, silver's industrial demand hit yet another record in 2024, and it looks strong for the next 25 years, too.
           

              
           

             Contrast that with 25 years ago. Back then, photography was the single biggest use of silver. And that industry's silver demand set an all-time record in 1999.
           

              
           

             But from there, photographic demand halved by 2007...it was then overtaken by solar-energy in 2011...and it's now down 90% by weight, tumbling to a barely noticed also-ran among silver's big technological uses.
           

              
           

             Which brings us to the platinum group metals, and the ""death"" of the internal combustion engine.
           

              
           




              
           

             Both platinum and palladium continue to find their largest single use in autocats for reducing harmful emissions from fossil-fuel engines.
           

              
           

             Burning fossil fuels is bad for pretty much everything except oil and gas company profits (and the tax they generate).
           

              
           

             So the world has decided that internal combustion engines must go the way of the horse-drawn carriage and vanish from new car showrooms by 2030. Or maybe 2035.
           

              
           

             Okay, call it 2050. Or failing that, 2060 at the very latest. Or 
            beyond that, so long as you offset all the carbon, okay?
           

              
           

             As it is, the death of the ICE remains 
            a Mark Twain joke more than a fact, because people keep making and buying those vehicles. That means they keep needing autocats too, and those 
            autocats have needed ever-more platinum group metal so far this century, as the chart above from Johnson Matthey shows.
           

              
           

             Yet while 
            platinum prices have gained 106% so far since New Year's Eve 1999, the white metal peaked way back in 2007 above $2200 before slipping and sliding back to around $900 as 2025 began.
           

              
           

             Palladium did exactly the same, but with a very different path. Also starting the new century at $440 per ounce, it rose 105% across the first 25 years of the new millennium in Dollar terms. Yet palladium didn't peaking until 2022, some 15 years later than platinum, and it topped way higher at $3400 per Troy ounce, only to drop back to the $900 level at the end of last year, again returning to match its sister metal's price once more.
           

              
           

             So while the net outcome for Pt and Pd was the same, almost down to the dollar, their paths were strikingly different from each other and also from silver or gold, too. Yet the fact remains that, for ICEs at least, platinum and palladium may have an important lesson for silver:
           

              
           

The PGMs are irreplaceable in autocatalysts.


              
           

             Nothing else does the job so well. And thrifting by scientists trying to reduce the quantity used has hit rock-bottom, actually going into reverse, as higher environmental standards demand higher PGM loadings.
           

              
           

             Now 
            think about silver in solar panels. Lots of people in labcoats are busy trying to reduce if not expel silver from that green-energy technology. But again, to date, silver hasn't been replaced, and thrifting has ground to a halt for now...
           

              
           

             ...also going into reverse overall, as more efficient new cells are developed...
           

              
           

             ...and driving total photo-voltaic demand for the former monetary metal 
            up to fresh record highs.
           

              
           

             As for the PGMs, the cure for low prices might prove to be low prices, because...among scientists at least...research into new uses becomes much more likely when the stuff doesn't cost record-high prices.
           

              
           

             Not the most bullish path forwards to 2050 perhaps, especially not with that 'net zero' deadline sitting somewhere around 25 years in the future and palladium really, really needing to find alternative uses as the death of the ICE maybe becomes a reality at last. 
           

              
           

             Little wonder then that sentiment, right now, is so undoubtedly weak. You know, like it was for gold back at New Year's Eve 1999."
2025-02-07,"Title:Why the Arctic Matters
Article:Vast resources spur geopolitical scramble...


              
           


THIS investment story is unfolding far from Wall Street, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             I recently spoke with Jonathan Roth, founder of ResourceWars.com and a veteran of capital markets. He highlighted an increasingly urgent issue: the Arctic.
           

              
           

             As polar ice caps melt, new opportunities – and risks – are emerging in this increasingly contested region. Nations like the US, Russia and China are jockeying for influence, not only to access the Arctic's vast natural resources but also to secure strategic military and trading advantages.
           

              
           

             Greenland, in particular, is shaping up to be a geopolitical hotspot, and it's no wonder that Trump has repeated his interest in acquiring the island.
           

              
           

             During our conversation, Jonathan emphasized the Arctic's immense resource wealth. The region is home to some of the world's largest untapped reserves of natural resources.
           

              
           

             A 2008 study by the US Geological Survey says that the Arctic holds 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and other fuels – equivalent to Russia's entire oil reserves and three times those of the US.
           

              
           

             Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, is rich in critical minerals essential for modern technologies, including rare earth metals, graphite, niobium and titanium. These materials are vital for everything from smartphones to EVs to military hardware.
           

              
           

             Ice loss in the Danish territory has also exposed significant deposits of lithium, hafnium, uranium and gold. A 2023 survey by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland evaluated 38 raw materials on the island, most of which have high or moderate potential.
           

              
           

             Jonathan also pointed out that Russia has been quietly building its Arctic presence for over a decade. It now has the most significant military presence in the region, with refurbished Soviet-era bases and a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers.
           

              
           

             In 2024, some 38 million metric tons of cargo were shipped through Russia's Northern Sea Route (NSR), a record amount for a single year and a nearly tenfold increase from a decade earlier. The NSR is central to President Vladimir Putin's vision of a shipping lane that rivals the Suez and Panama Canal, but challenges like shallow, ice-filled waters and foggy conditions mean the route has a long way to go before becoming a global sea lane.
           

              
           




             Annual Income of Cargo Transformation Through the NRS in Russia
           

              
           

             The country's Arctic ambitions are about more than just trade. The region is a cornerstone of its strategy to secure military and economic power.
           

              
           

             This poses a significant concern for the US and its allies, especially as climate change accelerates ice melt and opens up new access routes. Russia's dominance in the Arctic could disrupt global trade, heighten geopolitical tensions and undermine US strategic interests.
           

              
           

             While Russia boasts dozens of icebreakers, including nuclear-powered vessels, the US is woefully behind. Jonathan highlighted that the last heavy polar icebreaker built by the US, the Polar Star, was commissioned nearly 50 years ago, in 1976. Meanwhile, the newer Polar Security Cutter (PSC) class of icebreakers, intended to bolster US capabilities, has faced years of delays and budget overruns.
           

              
           




             Number of Major Icebreakers and Ice-Capable Patrol Ships, by Country
           

              
           

             Recognizing this, the US has partnered with Canada and Finland under the ICE Pact to develop a new generation of icebreakers. Finland, which designs 80% of the world's icebreakers, brings valuable expertise to the table.
           

              
           

             Greenland's importance extends beyond its resource wealth. Jonathan noted the island occupies a key position along two potential Arctic shipping routes – the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route. As sea ice continues to melt, these routes could significantly reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the Suez and Panama Canals.
           

              
           

             Greenland is also home to Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule Air Base), a critical US military installation for missile early warning and space surveillance. The base's strategic value is compounded by Greenland's role in the so-called GIUK Gap (Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom) – a naval chokepoint in the North Atlantic.
           

              
           

             Investment in Pituffik has been inconsistent, however, and its importance has waned since the Cold War. Renewed attention to Greenland could help the US counter Russia's growing Arctic dominance and China's ambitions as a ""near-Arctic"" power.
           

              
           

             The Arctic's significance isn't just about resources or shipping lanes. It's about power, influence and the ability to shape the future of global trade and security.
           

              
           

             For investors, the region offers opportunities in sectors like energy, mining and infrastructure. Companies involved in rare earth mining, icebreaker construction and Arctic logistics could see significant growth as nations ramp up their Arctic investments.
           

              
           

             As always, investors should keep a close eye on these developments. The Arctic may be cold, but the race for its riches is heating up."

Article:Worked for America with Stable Money...


              
           


TODAY we are seeing a lot of the institutions and bad ideas of the Post World War II Consensus breaking down and collapsing, 
            writes Nathan Lewis of New World Economics in this article first published at Forbes.


              
           

             Among these is the rather stupid notion that economies should be managed by some combination of currency and interest rate manipulation, and ""fiscal stimulus"" spending that amounts to utter waste, for the simple reason that it has no justification except as ""stimulus"". 
           

              
           

             These are the conclusions of ""Keynesianism"", which has been taught in all universities since the 1940s.
           

              
           

             Note how this is completely opposed to what I've called the Magic Formula of Low Taxes and Stable Money. This is the Formula that enabled the United States to become the wealthiest country in the world, and the same Formula that enabled Japan or China to achieve similar results more recently.
           

              
           

             If the US sadly deviates from this Formula today, nevertheless taxes are Lower, and the currency is more Stable, in the US than in most any other developed country today.

             We see that it takes more and more Dollars to buy an ounce of gold; and also, more and more Euros or Yen.
           

              
           

             This is probably a reflection of a declining value of the Dollar, Euro and Yen themselves, rather than any change in gold.
           

              
           

             The average price of a hamburger in New York City in 1950 was $0.10. Today, it is a lot more than that – and still rising, at a rate that is quite unpleasant to anyone who gets hungry in Manhattan.
           

              
           

             Is there some shortage of hamburgers? Or maybe too many people have a job? (Economists keep telling us that the solution to ""inflation"" is more unemployment.) No, the reason that hamburgers cost a lot more now is because the Dollar lost value during that time – somewhat like the Turkish Lira has also lost value over the past 20 years, producing terrible chronic inflation in Turkey. Not as bad, but basically the same thing.
           

              
           

             Already certain measures of ""inflation"" are ticking up, and already economists are getting ready to tell us again that too many people are going to work and making a living. This is stupid – which is why we had to write a book about ""Inflation"". (Get the new paperback edition, with a new preface.)
           

              
           

             This is not how we used to do things. For most of United States history, we embraced the principle of Stable Money – money that is stable in value. This was exemplified by one of the first Acts of the new Congress, the Coinage Act of 1792. In that Act, it said:
           

              
           

             ""SEC. 19. And be it further enacted, That if any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said Mint shall be debased or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less weight or value...every such officer or person who shall commit any or either of the said offences, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death.""
           

              
           

             If you messed with the value of the Dollar, expressed in terms of gold and silver, you got hanged.
           

              
           

             But today, the value of the Dollar goes up and down every day, and mostly down in the longer term. Various representatives of the Federal Reserve bloviate in public about how it is not really their fault.
           

              
           

             The original principle of 1792, Stable Money, actually became a cornerstone of US policy for the next 179 years – until the Gold Standard was effectively ended on August 15, 1971. The United States, just like all decent countries had done for centuries previous, maintained a stable value for their currency by fixing its value to gold and silver, and then, by 1900, to gold alone.
           

              
           

             In practice, there have always been only two alternatives for currencies: have some kind of floating currency, or fix its value to some external benchmark. Today, more than half of all countries fix the value of their currencies to an external benchmark, most commonly the Dollar or Euro. Sometimes they are not as successful in this as we would like (their central bankers are as dumb as ours), but nevertheless, that is their policy.
           

              
           

             This works for smaller countries, but obviously the United States is not going to fix the value of the Dollar to the Euro or the Mexican peso. The only ""external benchmark"" of practical use is gold – just as an assembly of nations memorably decided at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.
           

              
           

             Jim Grant, one of our best financial historians, has called this ""the Gold Standard and the PhD standard.""
           

              
           

             The United States did not always stick to its Stable Money principles. There was a major episode of floating-currency disorder during the Civil War, and a number of other more minor incidents. But, as long as the United States stuck to the principle of keeping the value of the currency Stable, there was never a problem with ""inflation"".
           

              
           

             They made it all the way to 1950, with a hamburger that still cost $0.10 – probably not much different than in 1850.
           

              
           

             I think that Americans will get tired, pretty soon, of ever-increasing prices accompanied by ever-increasing blame-avoidance by the economic high priests of the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department.
           

              
           

             But simply being dissatisfied doesn't amount to much. You need a solution. There is only one solution that has always worked: fixing the value of a currency to gold.
           

              
           

             Our noble forefathers consented to hang anyone who messed with the currency. Maybe we don't have to go that far today, but it is a nice idea don't you think?"
2025-02-04,"Title:Trump's Fresh Gold Price Records Extend Profit-Taking by Investors
Article:But gold investing draws new buyers too...


              
           


NEW YEAR 2025 is bringing a wave of new investing into physical gold, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault.


              
           

             But existing owners across Western markets continue to trim their holdings, taking profit as a group as the 'safe haven' asset hits 
            fresh all-time gold highs on Donald Trump's return to the White House.
           

              
           

             BullionVault gained more than twice the number of first-time users this January than it did 12 months before. But overall, its customers ended the month owning a little less gold for the 16th month in the past 17.
           

              
           

             The price of gold continued to rise much faster than investors sold. That raised the value of client gold investment – all securely vaulted and insured in each customer's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich – by 7.4% to a new record near $4.0 billion (up 8.6% to £3.2bn, 7.9% to €3.8bn, 5.9% to ¥615bn).
           

              
           

             This extends the pattern of 2024, when 
            record-heavy profit taking by BullionVault users still left their vaulted gold holdings dramatically higher by value. Trump's trade tariffs are just the latest crisis to spur fresh record highs in gold investing prices.
           

              
           

             Indeed, the precious metal has doubled or more for Western investors 
            since the pandemic began five years ago.
           

              
           

             Yet rather than rushing for the exits above $2800 per ounce...
           

              
           

             ...or £2250 or €2700 or even ¥14,000 per gram...
           

              
           

             ...rich-world investors as a group continue to take only a little profit net-net from gold.
           

              
           

             That leaves the bulk of their gold allocation rising in value as a hedge against the new risks and volatility which 2025 has already brought.
           

              
           




              
           

             Using BullionVault's low-cost and award-winning platform, the number of investors choosing to start or add to their personal holdings of securely stored gold bullion edged 3.7% higher last month from December's figure.
           

              
           

             But the number of sellers leapt by 61.5%, hitting a 3-month high with the fastest jump since March.
           

              
           

             Together that knocked 
            the Gold Investor Index down 1.6 points to 52.7, the lowest reading since September and 2.4 points below the near-18 month high hit amid Trump's clean sweep of November's US elections.
           

              
           

             Tracking the number of buyers versus sellers on BullionVault each month since 2009, the Gold Investor Index set a decade peak at 65.9 as the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020. It then set a series low at 47.5 in March last year, signalling more sellers than buyers for only the 3rd time ever with a reading below 50. 
           

              
           

             Helping stem the index's drop was further strength in the number of first-time buyers. January 2025 saw the count of people opening a BullionVault account to buy securely stored and insured gold, silver, platinum or palladium more than double from 2024's exceptionally weak start (up 117.4%). And compared to the 2024 month-average, new account openings ran 40.8% ahead worldwide, led by a rise of 56.0% in the UK compared to the prior 12 months, 64.3% in Germany, and 66.9% in the Netherlands.
           

              
           

             France eased back, in contrast, slipping 11.9% from last year's average monthly pace as its political crisis took a pause between Prime Minister Barnier's resignation and the forthcoming austerity budget.
           

              
           

             The USA remained quiet as Donald Trump retook the White House following November's decisive election win, with the number of first-time US bullion buyers dropping 20.9% versus 2024's monthly average to the fewest since June.
           

              
           

             Silver holdings on BullionVault meanwhile ended January unchanged from December's 3-month high by weight, rising 7.3% by Dollar value to the highest since October above $1.1bn (up 8.9% to £947m, 8.0% to €1.1bn, 5.7% to ¥181bn) as silver prices also jumped like gold, albeit to only 7-week highs at the end of last month.
           

              
           

             Investors as a group chose to sell silver, with sellers outnumbering buyers across the month and pulling the Silver Investor Index down by 3.0 points to 49.7, its 5th sub-50 reading of the past 12 months.
           

              
           

             The spectre of profit-taking, in short, continues to stalk the surging price of precious metals. But those prices continue to rise much faster than investors are choosing to sell."

Article:Economic inflation and falling yields fade...


              
           


PROPERLY defining the current Macro will, by extension, help us properly set strategies for 2025 and beyond, 
            writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.


              
           

             It takes a lot of deep and ongoing work, not guessing or bias-promoting. We do this work in order to end up right on the big swings when the time is right, and to be right along the way in the interim. Charting and stock picking are fun, but only after the real work is done.
           

              
           

             Let's take a look at the 30-year Treasury bond yield Continuum from another angle by way of a chart I just found in my list that we used back in those critical days of early 2020 in gauging the coming inflationary recovery (and future inflation problem). I've marked it up further today in an effort to tell a story.
           

              
           

             My general view of this story is that what people call the ""Everything bubble"" is actually a long-term bubble in monetary policymaking. You can always count on government from either side of the aisle to auto-stimulate through fiscal policies. It has been periodically interrupted by bubble bursts, liquidity events and inflationary recoveries as our policy heroes swing into action. This continuum of invasive policy is ongoing, but in 2022, after the latest and most extreme policy kick-save ever, the bond market rebelled, and today the trend is gone. Poof!
           

              
           

             Now we are left to try to define what comes next after the end of an incredibly consistent and definable trend ended for this macro view.
           

              
           




              
           

             Alan Greenspan kicked off the age of Inflation onDemand back in the relatively innocent days of 2001-2004.
           

              
           

             This represented the start of a multi-decade phase of ever more intense, chronic and intrusive monetary policy in response to any and all market liquidity crises. Ole' Greenie laid the groundwork and Bernanke put it on steroids.
           

              
           

             Aside from the obvious effects of this policy (halting bear markets, resuscitating the economy, manufacturing inflation) the very acts of printing money and spending from an ever-growing bag of debt has created the ongoing and intensifying disparity between the haves (asset owners, who've seen their assets chronically rise due to inflation) and have-nots, who are not part of the investment class and whose paychecks have not nearly kept up with the macro parlor trick known as inflation, which has been inflicted upon society as a matter of...POLICY!
           

              
           

             Among other things, this dynamic – in my strong opinion – created the environment in which most recently the old party was thrown out and the Trump party was given its mandates. I will guess that in 4 years, after the coming inflation and/or economic bust, the reverse may happen.
           

              
           

             With the Continuum of long-term yields having busted its trend to the upside the setup is for Trump/Powell 2 to be more intense and rancorous than Trump/Powell 1, which was pretty damn rancorous (recall Trump's robo-tweeting, berating the Fed chief for not dropping the Funds Rate, despite the Continuum's then in-progress rise to the red EMA trend limiters). We noted at the time that Powell's Fed was going to do the bond market's bidding, not Trump's.
           

              
           

             Powell held his ground until the economy and inflation signals began to ease, when he began cutting rates, a regime that ended with a deflation scare and inflationary response for the ages, in Q1 2020, compliments of that jerk called the Corona Virus.
           

              
           

             Today the bond market is different. Captain Obvious wants you to know that. And it is not different in a pro-Trump way. If anything, Powell will – barring a complete capitulation to the will of the orange man – doggedly respect bond market signals.
           

              
           

             Hence, an economic downturn and market liquidation is almost necessary if markets and the economy are to continue with a semblance of ""business as usual"".
           

              
           

             However, Trump 2 is presenting as a force of nature compared to Trump 1. If this is all presentation and bluster with no real force behind him, Trump will probably have to sit back and eat the Fed's decision to independently manage markets monetary policy-wise. However, Trump has a thing in his pocket called fiscal (ie, governmental, political) stimulative policy, along with a mandate to use it however he, and the houses of Congress he puppeteers, see fit.
           

              
           

             In other words, the Fed could be marginalized in this scenario, leaving our economic fate to a real estate developer used to getting what he wants and used to using credit/debt to get it.
           

              
           

             It is shaping up as an epic struggle (in my opinion) between the bond market (and by extension, the Fed) and government. Most administrations, including Trump 1, eventually wilt before the great and power Fed of Oz. But Trump 2? Is he bluster or is he a force of nature? Real or Memorex?
           

              
           

             These are questions we need to take seriously, anticipate correctly and therefore, strategize by. 2025 may not be as simple as a contrarian bear play, although that is still my favored view. Von Mises wants us to know that there is another option as well.
           

              
           

             For those who want straight technical analysis and straight answers, please pardon my detour above. But it is how I operate. I cannot in good conscience just issue prognostications without doing and showing the work behind it. The summary of the above is that I have not yet decided for myself which way I firmly believe the 2025 macro will go.
           

              
           

             I have a favored plan (hat tip once again to the most reliable contrary indicator on the planet, carnival barker extraordinaire, Contrarian Investing With Jim Cramer). But we must be looking at as many viable possibilities as we can so that we do not operate in a vacuum of bias. I will be right or I will be wrong about the anticipated nearer-term contrarian market liquidation plan, that would come after a perhaps final drive upward in markets.
           

              
           

             The alternative is an inflationary ""crack up"" that becomes ever more intense, with an absolute bull (in a China shop) at the helm of the economy. In that event, things could appear bullish for longer, but also capital would be in flight, probably aiming for real assets relative to paper (stocks, currency, etc). It's a world of increasingly divisive geopolitics and a big time ""grab"" for these things could be in play.
           

              
           

             Maybe a fitting and climactic end to the age of Inflation onDemand, after all."

GOLD for central banks, ETFs and fear, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Those are the top three No.1 reasons why 
            anyone choosing to invest in gold won the 21st Century so far.
           

              
           

             But as we said in the first part of this first-quarter review...repeating a key point from 
            the LBMA's pre-Christmas seminar I chaired...let's not forget private demand in China. Or India.
           

              
           

             I mean, over the past 25 years of gold investing, how could you? Least of all when 
            New Year's Day in China just saw 
            gold prices in India hit new all-time highs?
           

              
           




              
           

             Ask any analyst or gold investor and they'll tell you:
           

              
           

             Demand from the citizens of gold's giant Asian consumer nations has grown over the past quarter century.
           

              
           

             But see how it mirrored private demand from the G7 economies of Europe, the USA and Japan? Who knew that?
           

              
           

             Time was, some pundits called the world's 2 most populous nations 'Chindia'.
           

              
           

             The term was coined in the early 2000s by Indian politician and columnist Jairam Ramesh. He 
            urged China and India to cooperate, rather than compete, to accelerate their inevitable re-emergence as world-leading economies after 3 centuries of Western dominance.
           

              
           

             Ten years later, Ramesh called his idea of 
            Chindia ""still vibrant"". By then, it had also become a topic of policy and intellectual debate for Chinese and Western academics and policymakers, plus a much blunter target for US marketing gurus and 'how to' books to help you exploit these new ""megamarkets"".
           

              
           

             Chindia has since become a romcom movie (set in the USA), and last year it was 
            used against Ramesh himself in a row over New Delhi kowtowing to Beijing!
           

              
           

             But 2 decades ago, this chimera also proved useful to Western investment analysts, especially in precious metals. Because while 
            India had long been the No.1 gold consumer nation, China was catching up fast.
           

              
           




              
           

             See where China's private gold demand overtook India?
           

              
           

             See how that's where it stopped tracking the Dollar gold price, too? It leapt most dramatically when Chinese households and investors seized on 
            the gold price crash of 2013...
           

              
           

             ...coincidentally the last time that Chinese horoscopes celebrated the Year of the Snake.
           

              
           

             Let's park that for today. Because for gold so far this century, the word Chindia meant something important which didn't need nuance or understanding, so long as it kept buying gold.
           

              
           

             Which it did. Most of all when the West did not.
           

              
           

             By weight, private-sector gold demand in the G7 rich-world economies grew or fell together with demand from Chindia in only 11 of the past 32 years, barely 1/3rd of the time.
           

              
           

             Across the first half of that period (shown in our first chart above) that figure read 50%, but it sank below 19% in the second half. And last year, 2024, was the first time in almost a decade that gold demand among households and investors in both Chindia and the G7 grew together. (Or so our guesstimates reckon today.)
           

              
           

             Taken apart, in contrast, China and India show strong co-movement in their private gold demand. Their purchases have grown or fallen together by weight in 16 of the past 25 years (64% of the time) with barely a break between 1998 and 2007 or 2013 to 2022.
           

              
           

             By weight, however, China's private-sector gold demand has outrun India every year since the big price crash of 2013. Or so the best available data say.
           

              
           

             On that, please note:
           

              
           

 Demand for jewellery isn't counted the same way as demand for coins, bars or gold ETFs. Trinket purchases are gross of reselling (ie, scrap) whereas the 'investment' category is net;
 There isn't any freely available or reliable recycling data for jewellery, not country-by-country. So like the World Gold Council (who publish the data now gathered and crunched by specialists Metals Focus we're using above), our charts and analysis lump gross jewellery in with net investment. Sorry;
 All private-sector gold demand in China ultimately starts on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the only legal route for bullion to enter private circulation. But India's government has no such pinch-point (or stranglehold) and cross-border smuggling makes the true size of private-sector demand ultimately unknowable. Indeed, smuggling explains how gold prices inside India have consistently run below the global price plus India's import duty and GST sales tax;
 Maybe more importantly, these figures don't include private-sector demand for vaulted gold bullion either. That has almost certainly leapt in China during its real estate, stock market and bank interest rate slump (now entering its 4th year). But it doesn't show up anywhere in hard data; indeed, the gold sitting on commercial bank balance sheets has actually shrunk, most likely because China's financial slump means investors now want to own allocated bullion (such as you buy and sell on BullionVault) rather than holding a mere promise which underwrites the bank, not the investor's portfolio;
 On top of all this, the numbers and charts above do not include central bank demand. Partly that's because we're focusing on private-sector demand, and partly because the 'true' figures for the People's Bank are contested and unknowable. Very possibly, they account for some of the gap between heavy imports and visible demand.


              
           

             That said, so might China's commercial bank holdings, allocated to 'gold accounts' for Chinese investors. And central bank buying might not make much difference to the big picture anyway.
           

              
           




              
           

             Remember, the idea of Chindia was simple, meaning stupid and blunt.
           

              
           

             It matched the early 2000s' 'commodity supercycle' or 'BRICS' marketing spin spun out by Goldman Sachs, and it enjoyed the same impetus too. Because oil prices, cheap exports and gold prices were all driven higher...or so the story goes...by the sudden switch to runaway capitalism by formerly communist/socialist Chindia.
           

              
           

             That switch saw over a billion people released from poverty. One of the first things they chose to buy with their new disposable income is gold. Or so the story goes.
           

              
           

             Yet as our chart above shows, the proportion of Chindia's soaring economic output which was spent on physical gold actually fell into the 21st Century...
           

              
           

             ...before recovering its early 1990s' levels as the Western banking sector's ""global"" financial crisis saw gold prices surge...
           

              
           

             ...only to drop back again across the past decade or so.
           

              
           

             Yes, the value of cash spent on gold by China and India has jumped since the turn of the Millennium. But it hasn't grown as fast as their GDP. Across the past 33 years, in fact, the first two 11-year stretches saw Chindia spent 0.68% of their joint economic output on gold, but that has fallen to 0.51% across the past 11 years.
           

              
           

             Bottom line? China and India have played a huge part in 
            gold's success as the 21st Century's No.1 asset class so far. But they could've been bigger. And odds are, long term, that they will be...
           

              
           

             ...whether or not the proportion of income and wealth they spend on gold rises...
           

              
           

             ...as Chindia's GDP continues to grow both in cash terms and relative to the early 21st Century's rich-world economies."
2025-01-31,"Title:Truth and Investing
Article:Price matters, even when distorted...


              
           


TRUTH, said the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, is tough, 
            writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.


              
           

             ""It will not break, like a bubble, at a touch; nay, you may kick it about all day like a football, and it will be round and full at evening.""
           

              
           

             In a quote attributed to Mark Twain, if you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything. So the only real question remains: for investors, can there be more than one truth?
           

              
           

             We're not sure there can be. There are clearly various styles of investing, just as each and every one of us has a different personality, needs, objectives, and fears. But fundamentally, we think most of us are probably after more or less the same thing:
           

              
           

             Decent, inflation-beating returns, probably allied with some form of income, and without incurring too much downside risk and notably the risk of ruin.
           

              
           

             To any value investor, the one fundamental truth is the price. The market price of any traded security is dictated every day between willing adults, buyer and seller. But there is no compulsion to accept that price. If we don't like the price on a given day or hour, we can always wait for a better one, or look for something else.
           

              
           

             It cannot be said too often: the most important characteristic of any investment you make, be it property, stocks, bonds or anything else, is the price you pay when you first buy it. Overpay, and you are likely to regret it. Buy it cheaply, and you will likely do well.
           

              
           

             The French scientist Blaise Pascal once suggested that all of humanity's problems stem for our inability to sit quietly in a room alone. He was more right than he could possibly have known – especially in a world of digital connectivity, smartphones, the wireless internet, and 24/7 social media.
           

              
           

             The problem for the 21st century investor is no different to the problem for the 17th century physicist: too many distractions, almost all of them triggered by our own essential curiosity and inability to sit still.
           

              
           

             Which is why we now find ourselves increasingly drawn to the Stoics. We don't remember being taught anything about them at school. We suspect we first came across them during The Silence of the Lambs when Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) alludes to Marcus Aurelius:
           

              
           

             ""Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature?""
           

              
           

             The Stoic approach to life can be summed up in Reinhold Niebuhr's Serenity Prayer, which has been adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous:
           

              
           

             ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.""
           

              
           

             There is much utility and wisdom in that short phrase – for investors as for everybody else.
           

              
           

             After 35 years of working in the capital markets, the principles of investing seem, if anything, to get simpler by the day. The most important drivers of return in portfolio construction are asset allocation and then security selection.
           

              
           

             Asset allocation is ""simply"" finding the optimal (or perhaps satisficing) mix of different types of investment types to ensure you have a sensibly diversified portfolio. It makes sense to own assets that aren't correlated to each other, and yet which all offer the potential – based, in almost all cases, on the truth of price – for decent returns over the medium and longer term.
           

              
           

             For us, those asset types are 'value' stocks; systematic trend-following funds; and real assets, notably assets related to the monetary metals, gold and silver.
           

              
           

             Except as a source of liquidity, both cash and bonds no longer feature materially in our portfolios given their comparatively low yields relative to their credit risks, and our expectations of an uncomfortable inflationary future not experienced since the 1970s.
           

              
           

             The one common thread that links everything within the portfolio is that we want them to be at least somewhat resistant to a market crash. In the case of the equity component, while we can't immunise everything against ""crash risk"", we can at least ensure we don't consciously overpay for investments, and we can also try to ensure that they possess what Ben Graham famously described as a ""margin of safety"" that will, to some extent, possibly insulate them against grievous market falls.
           

              
           

             And don't expect all of these types of assets to work all of the time, because life's not like that, and neither are the financial markets.
           

              
           

             Trend-followers, for example, made pretty heavy weather of things during the years of ZIRP. But that wasn't a huge concern, to the extent that their ""crash-proofing"" credentials weren't realistically required when equity markets essentially delivered the goods.
           

              
           

             Security selection, again, should be driven primarily by the truth of price. In the world of listed equities, for example, we favour companies run by principled, shareholder-friendly managers who are also expert at allocating their own corporate capital (ie, deciding whether it is best spent on corporate acquisitions, or on stock buybacks, or on dividends), and where the shares of those companies are not obviously trading at any great premium to their inherent net or book value.
           

              
           

             But the emotional and psychological challenges stay with us. Inasmuch as the politics and economics of our time influence the investment debate, you could plausibly argue today that the challenges are more extreme than they have been for several generations. The Covid crisis alone has lifted up a giant rock in the middle of our political and media culture, and we doubt whether anyone anywhere much likes what has been revealed scuttling around underneath it.
           

              
           

             The re-election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of Elon Musk as a social media icon, have sent twin unconventional wrecking balls into the world of both domestic and international political protocol. The global financial crisis (now almost two decades ago, though we live with its aftermath still) has ushered in wholly unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing (QE), zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and negative interest rate policy (NIRP) which many of us found wholly morally questionable but nevertheless massively distorting upon asset prices.
           

              
           

             Which is where the Stoics come in. If we're frankly unable to change the things that concern us (the woke mind virus; the economic insanity of 'net zero'; foreign wars) then it makes more sense to concentrate on the things that we can change – which is not just our investment choices and our investment strategy, but also how we choose to respond to those external world events.
           

              
           

             In many cases, as the likes of Rolf Dobelli have suggested, the best response to those things, particularly those things brought to us by the news media, is simply to ignore them – or, even better, never even to be troubled by them in the first place. The essayist and trader Nassim Taleb claims never to read newspapers or to watch news, on the basis that if anything truly important is going on, he'll always find out about it through friends, say, at a drinks party.
           

              
           

             Drawing on extraordinary investing facts highlighted by the US market analyst Michael Batnick a few years ago:
           

 The less you look, the better off you'll be. Tracking your portfolio returns in real time will be injurious to your mental health.
 When you were born trumps just about everything else in the significance not just of your investing experience but your investing outlook as well.
 Cash flows are better than commodities. (But own both. And own real assets anyway.)
 The stock market is not the same as the economy.
 You can calculate everything yet still not know how investors are going to feel. In other words, focus solely on the truth of price, and let other people worry about the ""macro"".
 And we strongly recommend buying a copy of Ryan Holiday's The Daily Stoic.


             These are dark times, and being able to draw on tried and tested psychological sustenance is an absolute godsend."
2025-01-31,"Title:Commodity Market Returns: Update
Article:2024 review for copper, gold, silver...


              
           


AT THE START of every year, we publish our popular Periodic Table of Commodity Returns, 
            says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             This interactive graphic details the gains and losses across the commodities market. Gold stood out as a bright spot in 2024, delivering one of its best annual performances in over a decade, while industrial and agricultural commodities faced significant challenges.
           

              
           

             Up an eye-popping 27.2% last year, gold's performance made clear its enduring role as a safe haven. Central banks continue their aggressive purchases, seeking diversification in an increasingly uncertain global economy. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures and a growing US deficit further boosted the appeal of the yellow metal, helping it outpace the S&P500 in 2024.
           

              
           

             On a year-over-year basis, the average annual price of gold has now advanced 84% of the time this century, notching 21 positive years out of the past 25 years. For the second straight year in 2024, gold was the best performing commodity. 
           

              
           




             Average Annual Gold Price Has Advanced 84% of the time this century
           

              
           

             Silver also posted strong gains in 2024, climbing 21.7%. I believe the metal's outlook for 2025 is even brighter.
           

              
           

             Industrial demand for silver, fueled by its critical role in solar panels and electrification, is expected to set new records. Its dual demand as both a precious and industrial metal places silver in a position to outperform gold in the year ahead.
           

              
           

             But the global manufacturing sector, a bellwether for commodity demand, ended 2024 on a weak note. The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI dipped further into contraction territory in December, falling below its three-month moving average and signaling declining output and new orders.
           

              
           

             This weakening trend points to a sluggish start for 2025, raising concerns about the demand for key industrial commodities such as copper, aluminum and nickel.
           

              
           




              
           

             China, the world's largest consumer of metals, was an unexpected bright spot as its manufacturing sector showed modest expansion. However, the broader outlook remains cautious, with business sentiment reaching a three-month low.
           

              
           

             Commodities tied to clean energy and electrification showed resilience in 2024, despite the global manufacturing slowdown and President Donald Trump's roll back of ""green"" agenda items. Copper and aluminum posted gains of 2.2% and 7.7%, respectively, supported by demand from renewable energy projects, electric vehicles (EVs) and grid modernization efforts. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) reported robust growth in clean energy deployment last year, with solar installations up 35% and energy storage installations surging by 76%.
           

              
           

             Meeting the exponential demand for metals critical to the energy transition will require significant investment in exploration and production. Ernst & Young (EY) projects that achieving global net-zero goals will necessitate 41 million metric tons of copper annually by 2050, a massive target given the lack of substantial new mining projects.
           

              
           

             According to S&P Global, only 14 new copper deposits were discovered between 2014 and 2023; that's significantly lower than the 75 new discoveries that were made between 2004 and 2013.
           

              
           




             Major copper discoveries have declined over the years
           

              
           

             While energy transition metals show promise, other commodities faced sharp declines in 2024. Natural gas prices plunged nearly 71%, weighed down by mild weather in Europe. Agricultural commodities also struggled, with wheat and corn falling 40.9% and 28.8%, respectively.
           

              
           

             Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, saw a significant drop of 21.8%, reflecting temporary oversupply and slowing demand growth in China. And the outlook for 2025 presents several headwinds for commodities.
           

              
           

             Trump's plans to expand fossil fuel production and eliminate EV mandates may slow progress on the energy transition. Proposed tariffs on China and other trading partners could further disrupt global trade, potentially reducing demand for industrial and energy commodities. Wood Mackenzie warns that these protectionist measures could shave 50 basis points off global GDP growth, with significant implications for oil and gas consumption.
           

              
           

             Interest rate policy adds another layer of complexity. While the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in 2025, the pace of easing may fall short of market expectations. Higher rates for longer could weigh on economic activity and dampen demand for raw materials.
           

              
           

             Despite the challenges, long-term opportunities remain abundant. Gold and silver are likely to retain their appeal as hedges against uncertainty, while metals like copper and nickel stand to benefit from ongoing investment in electrification and clean energy infrastructure. 
           

              
           

             The Periodic Table of Commodity Returns highlights the cyclical nature of markets and the importance of staying informed. As 2025 unfolds, investors can position themselves to weather the challenges ahead and seize opportunities in the next phase of the global economy."
2025-01-30,"Title:Tech Bubble Bursting, 1920s Edition
Article:Happened then, ready now...?

 IN THE 1920s Radio Corporation of America (RCA) was the hottest stock in the world, writes Jim Rickards at The Daily Reckoning.
 Radio was cutting-edge tech, and RCA was dominant in the sector. The company was the largest manufacturer of radio sets and operated the largest broadcasting company, NBC. They owned key patents and had attracted many of the country's best engineers.
 In 1921 RCA shares traded as low as $1.50 (split-adjusted). By 1929 RCA rose to a peak of $549. A 352x return.
 At its highs in 1929 RCA was trading at a P/E of 72x. Speculation had driven the price far beyond rational levels.
 The bubble popped in 1929, and by 1932 RCA shares were trading at $15. That's still a 10x return over 11 years, but the majority of investors had bought in at much higher prices. The use of margin borrowing was commonplace, and added fuel to the fire (sound familiar?).
 Of course, we also saw a similar mania during the dot-com bubble. Cisco, Intel, and a few other tech leaders soared to unimaginable heights, then crashed back down to Earth.
 You could say RCA was the Cisco of the Roaring '20s. And possibly the Nvidia of its time.
 Is DeepSeek the pin today?
 China's new AI model DeepSeek R1 has the potential to be the pin that pricks the AI bubble. But it hasn't happened yet.
 On Monday, Jan. 27, Nvidia shares fell 17% after the market had digested China's AI developments. Shares then rebounded by almost 9% before losing half that rally on Wednesday.
 I don't know if this Chinese AI model will be the catalyst that ends the AI mania. But the bubble will inevitably end.
 The market is poised for a crash, it only requires the right catalyst. Something frightening. A bank run, financial crisis, war, or even an AI breakthrough from our primary competitor.
 Whether this latest Chinese AI model is that catalyst remains to be seen. But the 17% one-day drop in Nvidia shares does demonstrate that this market is easily spooked.
 The rise of AI in America has severely concentrated market risk. Even before the AI boom, markets were already heavily tilted towards big tech.
 Today it's far more pronounced. Anyone investing in the S&P 500 has more money in the Mag 7 stocks than they do in the bottom 400 companies put together. These 7 big tech firms make up about 34% of the entire S&P 500.
 This is what happens during bubbles. A handful of companies dominate the market.
 Make no mistake, these periods are driven by real advances. But they inevitably get out of control. It has happened with every major technological development. Railroads, internet, crypto, and now AI.
 Anyone who has studied manias can clearly recognize the signs. Problem is, it's difficult to know exactly when it will end. But judging by the market's recent action, we're getting closer.
 If you own almost any American stock market index, you likely have plenty of exposure to Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and the rest of the Magnificent 7.
 Now is not a time to jump into these names as the tech sector remains vulnerable. I much prefer to buy areas the rest of the market is ignoring. Gold, silver, miners, oil and gas, residential real estate. Hard assets.
 Despite all the hype around this tech cycle, we are still entering a hazardous monetary period. The US and much of the world have entered into debt spiral territory. Once debt/GDP broaches 120%, as it did recently in the US, it almost always leads to a debt or monetary crisis. Even in a best case it leads to a prolonged period of slow growth, which is also poison for stocks.
 AI is powerful, but it cannot save us from mathematics. So if you don't have any, go buy some hard assets. The easiest place to start is gold and silver. I suggest that everyone should have 10% of their portfolio in these assets. They remain the ultimate diversifiers."
2025-01-25,"Title:Operation Contain China, Status Failure
Article:Biden handed China the AI keys...

 AMERICAN A.I. companies are feeling the heat over the past month, writes Adam Sharp for Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 China is catching up. In some areas, they are even surpassing the US in artificial intelligence. It may seem hard to believe, but it's true.
 Chinese companies DeepSeek and ByteDance recently released models which are on par with the best models from top US companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.
 Here's what legendary venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen had to say about DeepSeek's new R1 reasoning model:
 ""Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen - and as open source, a profound gift to the world.""
 This Chinese model is ""open source"" meaning anyone can freely use it in their own applications. And it costs 1/10th to 1/30th as much as the equivalent US models.
 Yes, that's right. China is now ""dumping"" cheap, high-quality AI access on the world, as they have similarly done with steel, cars, rare metals, and thousands of other products.
 On top of all this, these new models are about 95% cheaper to build compared with top American models.
 The implications are massive. In the long run, this could threaten not just American AI software companies, but also NVIDIA. If cutting-edge models can be trained with 5% of the previous hardware requirements, what does that mean for GPU sales going forward?
 How did we get here?
 Two words: Joe Biden.
 The damage his administration caused to American AI efforts will echo for the next decade. President Trump is already working to reverse the damage, but this will take time.
 The first thing the Biden admin did was attempt to strangle America's AI industry. Marc Andreessen has said that in a meeting on the AI industry, Biden officials told his venture capital firm the following:
 ""Don't fund AI startups. That's not something that we're gonna allow to happen...
 ""AI is going to be a game of 2 or 3 big companies working closely with the government...We're going to protect them from competition, control them, and dictate what they do.""
 Biden (or his handlers) wanted an AI industry they could control completely. The admin issued AI ""safety"" executive orders designed to limit competition. Fortunately, Trump has already repealed these EOs, but they set us back for 2+ years.
 In a 2022 effort to contain China's AI advancement, Biden cut off the country's access to high-end NVIDIA GPUs, which are (were) the only suitable hardware to build and run AI applications with.
 These tech sanctions have backfired spectacularly. We cornered China and gave them only one way out: innovation. It appears they have met the challenge.
 They learned to build cutting-edge AI applications without high-end NVIDIA GPUs. As a result, they can now build models for a tiny fraction of the cost we do.
 Fortunately the bulk of their breakthroughs are ""open source"", meaning we can learn from and incorporate the designs into future work.
 But if we had simply let China have access to top NVIDIA chips, these breakthroughs probably wouldn't have happened for years. They wouldn't have needed to. And NVIDIA would have sold a LOT more chips. Now China has its own competing chips, and is making the most of its hardware by maximizing efficiency.
 Necessity breeds innovation, and Biden gave China all the necessity it needed. This proves, yet again, that sanctions on big developed countries almost always backfire.
 Now we find ourselves in a difficult spot. As I mentioned, Trump is already working to address these challenges, and I believe he will eventually find success.
 But we can no longer pretend that China is behind on AI. That era is over. The project to contain their development has failed. It's time to strike a deal with China, and I continue to believe it will be one of Trump's top priorities.
 In response to these Chinese breakthroughs, Trump is launching the $500B StarGate project with OpenAI, Oracle, Softbank, and others.
 Hopefully this project will take the lessons from Biden's China mistakes to heart. We need to be more efficient with our chips. We can no longer rely on brute force to dominate artificial intelligence.
 The wakeup call has arrived. We can no longer underestimate China's AI sector. American companies will have to step up, and release new cutting-edge products (even if they are unsure about issues like safety).
 Things are about to get very interesting."
2025-01-24,"Title:Cramer's Contrarian Trump Call
Article:Unwitting king of big calls strikes again...

 CONTRARIAN INVESTING is simple, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 When the herd thinks one thing, you think the other. And there is no greater tender of the investing herd than Financial TV star Jim Cramer.
 His inverse record of correct market calls is amazingly accurate. This is not just me poking fun at a cartoon character on the TeeVee. It is me (and many others) having observed this man's record in action, over many years. He's got a TV show, after all. He's got to give his viewers what they want: red meat.
 Boo effing ya! ""Unbridling the Bull"" indeed.
 CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday told investors there will be a shift in Wall Street's focus, from the actions of the Federal Reserve to those of President Donald Trump.
 ""We're now looking at the changing of the guard from Powell to Trump,"" he said. ""It won't be easy, as one's a pretty predictable guy and the other's a wild card.""
 Jim Cramer told ""investors""...ah, Cramer told a particular herd that thinks it can tune in to a sensational TV show and gain something of value. ""Investors""? Yes, I am sure that Dalio, Tudor Jones and Druck were riveted to their seats in rapt attention.
 What the clown prince of contrarian investing is actually saying – in terms that his audience can understand – is that governmental fiscal policy will largely replace Federal Reserve monetary policy. It's just that the word ""Trump"" is so dynamic, emotional and to some, exciting, that Cramer and the network he performs on will of course put it in those terms.
 ""It feels like we may be back in the world that I remember, a world where the Fed only plays a role at extreme moments,"" he said. ""A world where we don't have to guess and guess and guess their next move, or even listen to what the regional governors are saying, because it won't be that important in the margins.""
 The above is actually a good point he's making. However, it is not as simple as that. In fact, the bullish implications of Trump are the basis of why a contrarian investing opportunity (an opportunity to go the opposite way of the herd and its predominant perceptions) is likely (IMO) in development, because Trump is so pro-business.
 The previous administration did all it could to pump the system to new heights of debt and mal-investment. Interest rates have lurched back upward on the back of that and the stated policies to come from the Trump administration. Oh and there's this...the Fed still matters. Oh yes it does. We'll see the degree to which it matters when Trump launches his first volley of verbal bombs at Jerome Powell.
 Here I disclaim that I too wish we lived in a world without a monetary central planning authority. But I am dealing in the world we have, not a Utopian world.
 Hearken back to late 2018 when long-term Treasury yields were busting upward to test the upper bound of our then resistance limits (monthly EMA 100 & 120, now supportive limits) on the Continuum (30yr Treasury yield) as Trump constantly hectored the Fed chief to drop the Fed Funds rate. Powell all but ignored him.
 
 If history (eg, 2018) repeats, the Fed will bow to its true master, the bond market. Not its new (would-be) master, Trump.
 Back in 2018 Trump messed up his timing, because he attacked Powell as yields were rising and the Fed was following bond market signals. After that came the decline (from the limiters) as was usual during the Continuum's decades of trending down.
 Today, the situation is much worse, from a bond market perspective. My view is and has been that no matter Trump's pro-business, pro-economy intentions, the macro is stressed to a coming reversal point. Maybe after a big time clean-out, Trump 2 will take hold to positive economic effect.
 In other words, there is no denying that deregulation, tax cuts and maybe even some aspects of tariffs would be positive for corporations. The stock market is made up of...corporations. But we are talking interim here. An interim where perceptions are unified in one direction after that direction has already been in play since the 2020 mini-crash. It is in play with a host of negative macro internal conditions and indications.
 Now the play is on a popular TV cartoon show. Just sayin'."
2025-01-16,"Title:ChatGPT vs Gemini Gold Price Predictions 2024
Article:Did human forecasts or AI predictions prove most accurate for precious metals in 2024...?


              
           


AFTER GOLD had a strong end to 2023, BullionVault users were also bullish for 2024, with over 2,000 survey respondents on average predicting a price rise to $2342 price per Troy ounce by the end of December 2024.
           

              
           

             We'll see how accurate that forecast proved in a minute. Because with gold racing higher early last year following that bullish price prediction, it got us thinking.
           

              
           




             Like gold, global stock markets had also risen sharply in 2023 and hit new all-time highs in 2024, led by shares related to artificial intelligence such as Nvidia. So, what did some of the world's most popular AI tools (ChatGPT and Google's Gemini) think of gold and the wider bullion market this year?
           

              
           

             On 23 February 2024, we asked the two natural language processing tools to predict the prices of gold, silver, platinum and palladium over the next 4 calendar quarters. We could then compare those AI forecasts against the very human forecasts from BullionVault users, as well as from professional forecasters at bullion banks, brokerages and specialist consultancies.
           

              
           

             Below, we've compiled the 2024 price predictions from those AI tools, BullionVault's investor community, professional gold market commentators, and the actual quarterly price outcomes.
           

              
           

             Who proved to be the most accurate forecaster at the end of 2024: human investors, human experts, or AI machines?
           

             
           
How accurate were AI precious metals price forecasts in 2024

             In general, Google’s Gemini price forecasts for 2024 were closer to the actual 2024 quarterly average bullion prices than ChatGPT predictions. 
           

             
           

             Across all 4 quarters Gemini’s price predictions were on average closer to reality for gold, platinum and palladium than ChatGPT. 
           

             
           

             However, when predicting 2024 quarterly silver prices ChatGPT’s forecasts were slightly more accurate than Gemini’s. 
           

             
           

             As you’ll see from the charts below, when trying to forecast palladium prices for 2024 ChatGPT clearly referenced incredibly bullish data and ended up predicting prices that ended up being more than double actual prices. 
           

             
           

             See below more detailed commentary for each individual metal.

Last updated on 2 January 2025. Data for 30 December 2024. Source: ChatGPT, Gemini and LBMA


              
           

             Clearly, ChatGPT and Google's Gemini were far more bullish on gold than BullionVault users, never mind 
            the LBMA's panel of analysts, who were asked to forecast gold's annual average price across the year. 
           

              
           

             Our New Year 2024 survey of 2,002 precious-metal investors (who say they typically hold 85% of their investable wealth in other assets) found that a quarter (25.0%) believed monetary policy such as interest rates and quantitative easing or tightening would have the greatest impact on gold prices from January to the end of December last year. This was closely followed by geopolitics and government spending (22.0% and 20.8% respectively).
           

              
           

             Would that prove to be a useful insight? Twice a year we 
            survey investors who've chosen to use BullionVault for their opinions on where precious metals prices will trade on the next New Year's Eve. We also ask them what factors will have the biggest impact on those prices.
           

              
           

             In December 2022, when gold was trading at $1800 per ounce, BullionVault's survey respondents predicted that the price would reach $2012 twelve months later. Not too bad when you consider the gold price averaged $2029 for the month last December.
           

              
           

             The following Christmas we asked them to forecast where gold prices would then end 2024. This time, on average, they predicted $2342 per ounce, some 10% below the final price of the year but much closer than most professional analysts had guessed.
           

              
           

How did AI gold price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?

              Gemini's high and low quarterly average price predictions for gold in 2024 were far tighter than those for ChatGPT and when examining Gemini' s average quarterly price forecast compared to the actual prices, Gemini predictions only varied by 1.7% compared to the actual average quarterly gold price over the year. 
            

              
            

              However, if you only look at the Gemini predictions for the last 3-quarters of 2024, the variance vs the actual average prices drop to 0.4%, indicating that Gemini's 2024 quarterly gold price forecast made back in February was quite accurate and certainly closer than the LBMA analysts' forecast or BullionVault's users predictions.

              Again in silver, AI predicted significant rises in the price by the end of 2024, with ChatGPT forecasting a potential high for silver of $40 per ounce. That would have marked a new record year-end price, albeit some way short of the all-time highs near $50 reached in January 1980 and April 2011. 
            

               
            
How did AI silver price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?

              ChatGPT got closer than Gemini in estimating silver bullion's price over 2024, although as the chart above shows, ChatGPT had very wide spreads between high and low quarterly prices. On average over the 4 quarters ChatGPT predictions on average varied by 8% compared to the actual quarterly average prices. 
            

              
            

              BullionVault's users predicted that the silver price would end the year at $29 per ounce which was more bullish than the LBMA analysts' annual average prediction of $24.80 and even more accurate than ChatGPT's projection.

              Unlike its prediction for gold, Gemini's platinum price forecast for 2024 seemed a little more conservative and less bullish. However, ChatGPT 'thought' that platinum prices could go significantly higher.
            

               
            
How did AI platinum price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?

              ChatGPT's price predictions were wildly out compared to the actual quarterly average platinum price. But looking more closely at the chart above, this was due to the extremely bullish nature of the upper price in its forecasted range. 
            

              
            

              Gemini quarterly price estimates for platinum only varied by 1.0% versus the actual price outcomes over 2024. Combined with its Q4 forecast's midpoint being less than $10 higher the final average Q4 price, Google's AI tool's estimates were more accurate than both BullionVault users and the LBMA analysts' forecasts.

              Did ChatGPT know something that the LBMA's 25 expert analysts did not? Or was there simply not enough data on the internet regarding palladium for our two AI tools to predict such widely different prices?
            

               
            

              Whatever the reasons, clearly ChatGPT got very confused when making its predictions in February 2024.
            

               
            
How did AI palladium price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?

              Gemini's price predictions were closer that its AI competitor but still on average 21.5% different to reality over 2024. 
            

              
            

              BullionVault's users didn't do too badly, with their end-year price forecast coming second to the LBMA analysts' annual average forecast for the 2024 price.

2025-01-13,"Title:Debt Ceiling's Kabuki Comeback
Article:Trump 2.0 brings same plot, new twist...


              
           


As TRUMP PREPARES to take office, the tired old ""Debt Ceiling"" Kabuki Dance plays on, 
            writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.


              
           

             Yes ladies and gentlemen, it's that time again. Time for the Kabuki dance that government puts on every so often when an inconvenient limit to the debt the government can push into a bag that is already stuffed with $35 trillion in legacy debt needs to be addressed.
           

              
           

             We citizens can sit back, be entertained, and be expected to believe this is sound business as usual. The US economy has a right to grow unabated, you know. And this right is supported by both sides of the political aisle.
           

              
           

             Look at GDP vs. debt beginning at the dawn of the age of 
            Inflation onDemand (2000, courtesy of the great Maestro, Alan Greenspan). Back then, the debt was half of GDP. Over the years, our dependence on debt leverage has steadily increased to the point where today it is significantly higher than GDP.
           

              
           

             Government wants to increase the debt limit yet again. And they will. The theme (rationale, pipe dream, fantasy) is probably along the lines of sweeping tax cuts meaning that a productive economy will naturally address the debt, allowing pay-down after more debt funds said ""productive"" economy.
           

              
           

             Okay, a lotta moving parts there, guys. But have at it, I guess.
           

              
           

             Since when have Republicans become the primary instigator for such action? The Republican party I thought I used to know was pro-business, pro-economy, sure. But it was also pro-fiscal responsibility, at least on its public face.
           

              
           

             Now, it is far from that, not even pretending it wants to do the right thing, fiscally. Where are daddy and junior Paul, by the way? At least they are conservatives, in action as opposed to words.
           

              
           

             Trump is a businessman. He has used debt in myriad ways to both grow his businesses, and in astutely managing bankruptcy laws, sustain his businesses. America is gonna be great again.
           

              
           

             But that greatness will only go as far as the debt market – the bond market – allows.
           

              
           




              
           

             The bond market has thus far allowed. But currently it is doing this to long-term interest rates.
           

              
           

             Let's remember that fiscal and monetary inflators of yore had a continuum of declining yields at their back until 2022. Today's bunch have no such beneficial macro backing.

2025-01-10,"Title:AI Boom Boosts US Energy Demand
Article:Massive gains for utility stocks in 2024...


              
           


U.S. STOCKS rose again in 2024, delivering a second consecutive year of gains exceeding 20%, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors, as investors embraced cooling inflation, falling interest rates and the prospect of lower corporate taxes under a second Trump administration.
           

              
           

             The last time the S&P 500 achieved two or more straight years of +20% growth was during the late 1990s, when the internet boom fueled market optimism.
           

              
           

             Much like those high-flying days, 2024 saw tech stocks capture investors' imaginations. This time, though, it was the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) that drove enthusiasm.
           

              
           

             Among the top five best-performing S&P 500 stocks, two (Palantir and Nvidia) are directly tied to AI, while two others (Vistra and GE Vernova) benefit indirectly through increased energy demand.
           

              
           

             United Airlines, the fifth-best stock, is reportedly integrating AI to streamline operations like notifications and pilot rebooking, but investor excitement appears largely centered on the recent travel boom and United's $1.5 billion share buyback program.
           

              
           




              
           

             AI dominated headlines and the stock market in 2024, pushing companies like Palantir and Nvidia to triple-digit growth.
           

              
           

             Palantir, which specializes in data analytics and AI platforms, saw a massive 340% surge in its stock price, making it the best performing S&P 500 stock of 2024. Its work with the Department of Defense has been particularly impactful. Major contracts, such as a $480 million deal for its Maven Smart System and a $401 million follow-on contract for its data-gathering Vantage platform, highlight Palantir's expanding role in military applications.
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, 
            Nvidia benefited immensely from its position as the dominant supplier of graphics processing units. The Santa Clara-based company – whose technology powers data centers around the globe, with its GPUs enabling AI applications and Bitcoin mining – generated a jaw-dropping $35 billion in revenue in the third quarter alone as demand for its hardware has soared. As of 6 January 2025, Nvidia was the world's second-largest company by market cap, valued at $3.7 trillion.
           

              
           

             Utilities, the lowest-performing S&P 500 sector in 2023, rebounded strongly in 2024, reflecting a major shift in electricity consumption as AI, electrification and decarbonization drive demand. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) predicts that global electricity use could rise as much as 75% by 2050.
           

              
           

             This is good news for providers like Vistra and GE Vernova, the number two and number four best performing S&P 500 stocks of 2024.
           

              
           

             Vistra, which joined the S&P 500 in May of last year, saw its stock price skyrocket by 261% in 2024. The company's natural gas and nuclear power plants are well-suited to meet the reliability and scalability needs of data centers. Strategic agreements with cloud computing giants like Amazon and Microsoft to supply power at premium prices further bolstered its financial performance.
           

              
           

             GE Vernova, General Electric's energy spinoff, also saw remarkable growth in 2024, with its stock rising 150% after going public in April. The company's gas turbines have seen strong demand as providers seek to address the growing energy needs of data centers.
           

              
           

             Vernova's involvement in renewable energy projects – such as the $2.75 billion wind energy agreement in Australia, signed a year ago – further cements its position as a leader in the sector. The GE spin-off has projected sales of $45 billion in 2028, up from previous estimates of $43 billion.
           

              
           

             United Airlines represented a different investment narrative in 2024: the resurgence of post-pandemic air travel. Shares of the Chicago-based airline soared 135% last year, marking the carrier's best year ever since going public in 2006.
           

              
           

             Air travel surged in 2024, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reporting screening a combined 900 million+ passengers at US airports, the most on record. United capitalized on this trend in 2024 by operating its largest-ever domestic schedule and greatly expanding international routes.
           

              
           

             Eye-popping passenger volume certainly turned heads, but it was the company's massive $1.5 billion share buyback program, announced in October, that truly boosted investor sentiment.
           

              
           

             On a slightly different note, the correlation between gold and the S&P 500 reached an unprecedented 0.91 in 2024, meaning that the two assets moved in tandem almost 100% of the time throughout the year.
           

              
           

             Gold has historically shared an inverse or low correlation with stocks. That's precisely why many investors favor gold.
           

              
           

             Take a look at the period from the mid-80s to early-90s. Gold prices were largely agnostic to what equity prices were doing, making the metal an ideal diversifier.
           

              
           




              
           

             Granted, we've also seen periods of sustained positive correlation (check out the entire 2000s decade), but we've never seen such a strong relationship between the two asset classes as we did in 2024.
           

              
           

             So what gives?
           

              
           

             First, global central banks have begun a coordinated monetary easing cycle, cutting interest rates to stimulate economic growth. This has created a favorable environment for both stocks (as borrowing costs declined) and gold, which, as a non-yielding asset, has historically thrived when interest rates were low.
           

              
           

             Second, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty have persisted, driving investor demand for safe-haven assets like gold while also supporting equity markets through increased government spending on defense, cybersecurity and infrastructure.
           

              
           

             Third, shifts in asset allocation strategies appear to have played a role. Investors increasingly sought diversified portfolios, blending traditional assets like stocks and bonds with alternative investments such as gold and Bitcoin to hedge against inflation (which, despite falling, remained elevated in 2024). I believe this likely contributed to the tighter correlation between gold and S&P 500 stocks."
2025-01-08,"Title:Trump 2.0 Will End Today's Currency Wars
Article:Well, that's the plan apparently...


              
           


THERE has been a lot reported in recent days about the return of currency wars, 
            says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             With Trump 2.0 about to begin, let's review his last term and what to expect in the second.
           

              
           

             Trump badly bungled his transition after first being elected president in 2016. He was not ready with a long list of loyal appointees. Many of his senior appointments such as Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, and John Kelly as Chief of Staff secretly disliked Trump but accepted their roles as so-called ""adult supervision"" around the supposedly reckless Trump.
           

              
           

             They thwarted his agenda. That backstabbing came on top of the large number of Obama holdovers in the Deep State who saw themselves as a ""resistance"" movement.
           

              
           

             Trump is doing a better job of preparing for a second term as president, but the resistance is not sitting still either. As reported in the 
            Washington Post, Politico, the 
            Wall Street Journal, Yahoo Finance and other outlets, Trump is working on a secret plan to devalue the US Dollar. The goal would be to cheapen US exports and thereby help the US balance of trade and create exported-related jobs.
           

              
           

             But critics say that this will only increase US inflation as Americans have to pay more for their imported goods using cheaper Dollars. The critics also say that other countries will retaliate against the US by cheapening their own currencies (that's the essence of a currency war) and no country will be any further ahead. In fact, the entire world will be worse off.
           

              
           

             Before looking more closely at what's actually going on, some basics about a currency war should be explained. The first rule is that the world is not always in a currency war. The periods from 1944 to 1971 (the original Bretton Woods era) and from 1987 to 2010 (the period of the Washington Consensus) were times of currency peace. This contrasts with 1921-1936 (Currency War I), 1967-1987 (Currency War II), and the current period since 2010 (Currency War III).
           

              
           

             The second rule is that when we are in a currency war, they can last for fifteen years or longer. It comes as no surprise that the currency war that commenced in 2010 is still going strong 14 years later in 2024. And that points to another key aspect of this debate.
           

              
           

             The currency war being written about today by the media is not a new currency war. It's the same one that has been going on since 2010. We're simply in a new phase or a new battle.
           

              
           

             It is true that cheapening your currency can import inflation. Sometimes that's a legitimate policy goal if your country has been suffering from deflation. That's obviously not the case in the US today.
           

              
           

             It's also true that cheapening your currency can export deflation as trading partners pay less for your goods. That's what China was doing to the entire world from 1994 to 2010 and that's why the US launched a currency war in 2010 – to fight back against disinflation and borderline deflation caused by cheap Chinese goods.
           

              
           

             Currency wars can also shift jobs overseas and destroy domestic manufacturing as the terms of trade shift based on changing currency values. Retaliation is always waiting right around the corner in any currency war. The US Dollar hit an all-time low in August 2011, which was consistent with the US goal of trying to import inflation.
           

              
           

             But Europe struck back, and the EUR/USD cross-rate crashed from $1.60 to $1.04 as a result. So, it is correct that no one wins a currency war, and everyone is damaged in the process due to volatility, uncertainty, and the costs of conducting the war.
           

              
           

             So, are the critics right that Trump has a secret plan to devalue the Dollar? And are they right that this new stage in the currency war will bring inflation and hurt the US economy?
           

              
           

             The critics are wrong and don't understand what Trump is actually trying to do. Trump is not trying to start a currency war; he's trying to end it once and for all.
           

              
           

             In the first place, no president has the power to unilaterally devalue the Dollar. That might have been possible under the gold standard or some standard of fixed exchange rates, but that has not been the state of the world since 1973.
           

              
           

             Exchange rates fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates, industrial growth, exchange controls, central bank interventions, capital flows, tax rates and many other macroeconomic variables. But the idea that the president can just wave his hand and devalue the Dollar is false.
           

              
           

             Far from the reckless, inflationary process the media claim, Trump's actual plan is based on the highly successful model developed by James Baker for Ronald Reagan and implemented in the Plaza Accord of 1985 and the Louvre Accord of 1987.
           

              
           

             After the severe economic recession of 1982 and Paul Volcker's policy of moving interest rates to 20%, inflation in the US was finally reigned in. Inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980, to 6.1% in 1982, and then 3.2% in 1983. Investment in the US went on a tear. US real growth was 16% from 1983 to 1986. Everyone wanted Dollars to invest in the US and the Dollar boomed reaching an all-time high in 1985.
           

              
           

             Finally, the Reagan administration decided the US Dollar was too strong and was hurting US exports and jobs. Treasury Secretary James Baker convened a meeting of the finance ministers of France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. The purpose was not to fight a currency war. The purpose was to create order in currency markets out of the chaos that had prevailed since 1973.
           

              
           

             The parties reached a joint agreement that would devalue the US Dollar in an orderly fashion versus the French Franc, Japanese Yen, UK Pound Sterling, and the German Deutschemark. Once the targeted level for the Dollar was achieved, the parties would use their best efforts, including market intervention as needed to maintain those levels within narrow bands.
           

              
           

             A separate meeting in Paris at the Louvre in 1987 agreed that the devaluation phase was over, and the Dollar would be maintained at the new parities. This was not currency war; it was currency peace achieved by agreement and implemented in a cooperative fashion. The Louvre Accord (this time including the US, UK, France, Germany, Japan and Canada) ushered in a period of global prosperity that lasted twenty years until the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.
           

              
           

             Trump's goal is to repeat the success of the Plaza and Louvre Accords. Trump's advisor on this is Robert Lighthizer, who is one of the most brilliant financial minds around and was Trump's US Trade Representative (2017-2021).
           

              
           

             Lighthizer was also USTR for Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1985 so he's a veteran of prior currency wars and was in the administration around the time the Plaza Accord was being developed. Lighthizer is the perfect individual to help Trump achieve the kind of success that Reagan and Baker had in the 1980s.
           

              
           

             The media are trying to portray Trump as reckless when in fact he's proposing something highly beneficial for US jobs and US industry. Don't be fooled by false claims of new currency wars. Trump is trying to achieve a new era of currency stability and lasting prosperity."
2025-01-07,"Title:Surging Gold and Silver Prices Outrun Record Profit-Taking
Article:Investment demand net negative for 2nd year...


              
           


WESTERN INVESTORS sold a record quantity of gold and silver using BullionVault in 2024, 
            writes Adrian Ash at the world-leading precious metals marketplace.


              
           

             Yet the bullion they own still jumped by nearly one-fifth in US Dollar terms as silver prices hit 12-year highs and gold made its strongest run of new all-time records since 1979.
           

              
           

             BullionVault users last year cut their gold investing 6.0% by weight and silver by 4.7%. But surging prices meant that clients of the West London fintech ended 2024 holding 19.0% more value in gold at $3.7 billion...
           

              
           

             ...up 20.7% in UK Pounds to £2.9bn, 26.4% in Euros to €3.5bn, 31.9% in Japanese Yen to ¥440bn...
           

              
           

             ...while their securely-stored silver bullion rose 18.0% by value to reach $1.1bn on New Year's Day (up 19.3% in GBP to £869m, 25.0% in EUR to €1.0bn, 30.8% in JPY to ¥172bn).
           

              
           

             Record gold prices, in short, spurred record profit-taking in 2024. But private investing in gold or silver didn't shrink as fast as prices rose, even though rising stock markets and the highest real rate of interest on cash savings since before the global financial crisis also encouraged people to bank some of their gains and rebalance their investments.
           

              
           

             That shows solid commitment to precious metals as 2025 begins. And surveyed in December, users of BullionVault – nine in 10 of whom live in Western Europe or North America – 
            forecast that gold will now rise 17.6% this year to end at $3070 per Troy ounce, with silver rising 27.6% to $36.90.
           

              
           




              
           

             The number of people choosing to sell gold fell in December, dropping 28.2% from November's figure to a 6-month low as gold prices fell by 1.5% against the rising US Dollar (-0.3% in GBP, -0.2% in EUR, +3.0% in JPY). But the number of people starting or adding to their personal gold holdings also dropped, down by 20.8% to the fewest in 3 months.
           

              
           

             Together, that edged the 
            Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of private investor activity in physical bullion – down by 0.8 points from November's 17-month high to finish 2024 at 54.3, up 2.9 points from a year earlier.
           

              
           

             The index set a decade peak at 65.9 as the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020, and it set a series low at 47.5 in March last year, signalling more sellers than buyers with a reading below 50.
           

              
           

             Across the past 12 months on average, the Gold Investor Index slipped 0.4 points to 52.6, its lowest annual level since the reading of 52.2 in 2014, when gold prices were mired in a deep bear market.
           

              
           

             Indeed, 2024 was a bull market in price only for Western investing. Gold demand stayed negative for the second year running as profit-taking ran ahead of new buying, because – for Western investors at least – conflict was confined to the ballot box and equity markets rose to new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             But that calm now looks fragile as 2025 begins, and Trump's victory in the US election has driven a surge in first-time buyers, particularly across Europe.
           

              
           

             The number of first-time BullionVault users worldwide rose 42.4% last year to the most since 2021, almost half of them opening their account in the last 4 months. Of those, more than 60% live in the UK, Germany or France.
           

              
           





               
            


             The Silver Investor Index also fell in December, dropping 1.3 points from November's 21-month high to read 52.7.
           

              
           

             That put the index's 2024 average at 50.8, matching the prior year's series low.
           

              
           

             By weight, investors were net buyers of silver for the second month running, adding 1.9 tonnes and taking BullionVault client holdings 0.2% higher to the most since September at 1,156 tonnes. But the retreat in silver prices meant that gave the lowest value since July at $1.1bn, down 11.5% from October's record (-8.9% in GBP from £954m, -8.0% in EUR from more than €1.1bn, -9.0% in JPY from ¥189bn).
           

              
           

             Gold meanwhile returned to net selling after November's steep price drop 
            snapped a 14-month run of profit-taking, but with BullionVault users selling only 45 kilograms more gold than they bought as a group.
           

              
           

             That took client gold holdings down 0.1% to to 44.1 tonnes, more than most central banks hold and larger than all but 13 exchange-traded gold ETF trust funds, but the lowest weight since July 2020 and 4.5% below end-October's record value of $3.9bn (-1.9% in GBP from £3.0bn, -0.4% in EUR from above €3.5bn, -1.8% in JPY from ¥592bn).
           

              
           

Gold in 2024 made 38 new daily highs in US Dollar terms, matching 2011 – peak of the global financial crisis – with the most fresh records since the inflation-and-geopolitics price surge of 1979.
           

              
           

             For UK, Euro and Japanese Yen investors, gold hit a record number of new records last year, setting 40, 44 and 45 fresh all-time highs respectively."

SO AFTER a stand-out year beating all other assets except Bitcoin, gold will rise through $3000 per Troy ounce for the first time ever in 2025, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Says who?
           

              
           

             Says BullionVault users, that's who. And they're the best gold price forecasters of 2024.
           

              
           

             Silver will do even better, or so the forecast-winning hive mind of cost-and-safety conscious precious metal owners report...
           

              
           

             ...rising faster than gold to hit a new year-end record of its own at $36.80 per ounce.
           

              
           

             Why?
           

              
           




              
           

             BullionVault's survey has now run twice each year since 2014.
           

              
           

             This month it polled over 1,400 full responses. And it finds that investors are optimistic about gold and silver for 2025 because they are so pessimistic on geopolitics and government debt.
           

              
           

             Longer term, that second factor also poses the single greatest threat to the global economy and, therefore, to investment savings over the next 25 years too. Or so genuine investors sharing their thoughts in our survey say.
           

              
           

             Between now and 2050, unfunded government spending and the resulting mountain of national debt poses the No.1 challenge for investors according to more than a quarter of BullionVault users taking our survey (28.5%).
           

              
           

             That threat is followed by a loss of confidence in government (18.8%) and...for extra fun over the next quarter century...the growing risk of outright war between major powers (17.5%).
           

              
           

             Such happy thoughts come after 2024 proved a remarkable year for gold, topping 
            a stellar quarter-century during which the precious metal has beaten the return from all other assets, even the US stock market.
           

              
           

             While surging demand from households in China and India has supported this move, the switch into gold by private investors and more recently central banks has driven the precious metal to new all-time highs in terms of all currencies.
           

              
           

             Nearer to hand, the No.1 driver of precious metals prices in the coming 12 months will be Geopolitics according to almost a third of BullionVault users (31.4%). That's seen it overtake Monetary Policy (down at 16.8%) in BullionVault's New Year survey for the first time since 2022.
           

              
           

             In fact, concerns over the size of Government Budget Deficits and Debt come next, polling one-in-five responses (20.8%) and moving up to second place for the first New Year survey in four. 
           

              
           

             The impact on gold prices?
           

              
           




              
           

             The price of gold has risen by 26.4% this year in terms of the US Dollar, its 18th annual gain of the 21st Century to date and its strongest rise since 2007.
           

              
           

             Respondents to BullionVault's survey last December forecast that gold would reach $2342 this Christmas. Although 10.1% shy of the current price of $2606, that was much closer than consensus forecasts from bullion-market professionals.
           

              
           

             What's more, BullionVault users then raised their year-end forecast to $2583 in our July survey. That's less than 0.9% off today's current level, a remarkable win as the best gold price forecaster.
           

              
           

             Looking ahead, BullionVault's latest survey now forecasts a gold price of $3070 per Troy ounce at the end of 2025, an increase of 17.8% from today's level.
           

              
           

             Our survey finds even greater confidence in silver, forecasting an end-2025 price of $36.80 with a projected increase of 26.9% from today.
           

              
           

             That might sound dramatic...and the past doesn't promise the future of course. But the more industrially useful precious metal this year recorded its 15th annual rise since Millennium Eve, gaining 21.9%, hitting a run of 13-year highs, and spurring a mid-year hike to investor forecasts to say that silver would trade at nearly $34.50 per ounce by this New Year's Eve.
           

              
           

             That $5 over-estimate shows how big gains can invite big expectations, and that can invite disappointment. Because again, the past is no guide to the future as regulators and other spoilsports repeatedly claim.
           

              
           

             To be sure, the turnaround in gold and silver's fortunes so far this century shows how investment trends come and go.
           

              
           

             Twenty-five years ago, gold in particular 
            was lost in the investment wilderness...
           

              
           

             ...unwanted by central banks, unloved by investors, and struggling to find demand from its big consumer markets following the Asian Crisis.
           

              
           

             The positive shocks from the turnaround in those factors all now lie in the past. They cannot be repeated.
           

              
           

             But the key trends driving gold prices upwards since the Millennium look set to continue, at least for the near-term. And beyond that, geopolitics and worsening government debt will then drive gold and silver higher next year before continuing to harry and harrow the financial markets through to mid-century. Or so the latest survey of the world's largest pool of active precious metals investors predicts.

The PAST is no guide to the future, or so financial regulators and other investment spoilsports want you to think, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             But lucky for gold, it's true. At least across the past 25 years.
           

              
           

             Hated and dumped back on New Year's Eve 1999, a lump of 
            the barbarous relic is by far the best-performing asset of the 21st Century to date.
           

              
           




              
           

             What changed to make this happen?
           

              
           

             Lots of things. If not all of them.
           

              
           

             But time is tight, and besides, some things count more than others. The really important stuff might matter to whether you invest in gold over the next 25 years, as well.
           

              
           

             So gun to your head, how about we pick three points that stand out?
           

              
           

             That's what I asked Matt Turner of Anglo American and Suki Cooper of Standard Chartered at 
            the LBMA's pre-dinner seminars this Christmas.
              
           
 #1 Gold Driver No.1: Central banks

             Net-net as a group, central banks just can't get enough of the stuff today. Yet New Year's Eve 1999 found gold bullion loathed by central bankers like never before.
           

              
           

             A century earlier, these same bureaucrats had decided that gold was the be-all and end-all of monetary assets. But the warfare-and-welfare boom of the 20th Century put a stop to that. Element 79 just didn't fit.
           

              
           

             Gold vanished from hand-to-hand money in the 1930s, it vanished from backing most countries' money by the 1950s, and it was 
            finally cut from backing the United States' almighty post-war Dollar (and therefore from the rest of the world's money) in the early 1970s.
           

              
           

             A quarter-century later, that left very few central bankers with a memory of gold as a monetary asset, let alone a love for it.
           

              
           

             So as the Millennium drew near, European and other Western nations were selling gold, while Asian and other 'emerging' nations were too busy fighting currency-and-debt crises of their own to spare any cash on what no one else wanted.
           

              
           

             But this marked an extreme, not a new normal. And starting from there...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...and after 
            the gold price finally found a floor and turned higher in the early 2000s...
           

              
           

             ...global selling flipped into strong net demand from central banks when the 'global' financial crisis hit Western economies.
           

              
           

             Why? No one sells safe-haven gold during a crisis (not 
            outside the ultimate crisis). So Western central banks stopped dumping it.
           

              
           

             Just as importantly, the GFC saw interest rates on Dollars, Euros, Yen and Sterling collapse...
           

              
           

             ...down to zero and even below it.
           

              
           

             That forced emerging nations (who now had much bigger reserve-asset stockpiles to defend thanks to globalization sending them huge piles of Western currency to pay for huge piles of energy and cut-price manufactured goods) to spread their risk with a better store of value than the big reserve currencies now offered.
           

              
           

             Result? The strongest run of central-bank gold buying since the height of the interwar Gold Standard rush, plus the highest gold prices in history.
           

              
           

             Okay, okay. But what else is the No.1 reason for gold's big 21st Century bull market?
              
           
 #1 Gold Driver No.2: Gold ETFs

             The boom in investment access to gold can't be understated.
           

              
           

             It was 20 years ago last month that the giant GLD 
            gold ETF was launched onto the New York stock market.
           

              
           

             The GLD still accounts for a quarter of total gold ETF holdings worldwide, albeit down from 2/3rds during the global financial crisis. And back in 2004, it enabled US investors to do what a couple of trusts already let Aussie and UK investors do:
           

              
           

             Track the price of gold without owning the metal.
           

              
           

             Yes, gold ETFs are backed by gold to give their stock-market shares value. And that link meant that, pretty soon, the quantity of gold held to back ETFs also tracked the price. Or vice versa.
           

              
           

             Either way, ETF demand has 
            shown a strong and clear connection with the direction of bullion.
           

              
           




              
           

             Tangible assets are something which US fund managers in particular can't bear, because they can usually hold only securitized investments in their portfolios, not physical stuff.
           

              
           

             Prior to the ETFs, that meant big money either had to buy gold futures or options contracts...
           

              
           

             ...buying leveraged risk and paying costly derivatives fees to get gold-price exposure...
           

              
           

             ...or they had to buy gold mining shares, which are NOT the metal but carry management, equity, political and a host of other risks instead.
           

              
           

             So it was – ironically – the same rush of innovation which gave the early 2000s 
            such toxic assets as subprime mortgage CDS and the lethal CDO-squared that gave investors wanting a hedge for all that risk the chance to trade a gold-backed ETF...
           

              
           

             ...a stock-market quoted, gold-denominated debt security which is the obligation of a trust created for the specific purpose of enabling gold investment through it.
           

              
           

             Got all that? Simple folk wanting simple ownership might prefer simpler access. And they also got new gold products in the early 21st Century too.
           

              
           

             Yes, market-leader BullionVault, of course...
           

              
           

             ...now used by over 110,000 people worldwide to invest directly in physical precious metals, and now caring for $5 billion of precious metals for those users today.
           

              
           

             There was also a rash of new coin shops and e-tailers, all rushing to fill the gap which old-school dealers (including your local bank branch) had vacated during gold's long bear market between its 1980 top and the year 2000.
           

              
           

             But for the big money, especially money that didn't care so much about owning any gold, it was ETFs which revolutionized how fund managers could get into the metal. And that access soon meant the size of ETFs showed a remarkable link with the price of bullion.
           

              
           

             Between 2004 and 2022 in fact, their 12-month correlation averaged +0.84...
           

              
           

             ...a number which would read +1.00 if they moved exactly in lockstep, or -1.00 if they moved exactly opposite.
           

              
           




              
           

             But as our chart shows, this strong relationship between gold prices and gold ETFs broke down around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine...
           

              
           

             ...because while Western sanctions against Moscow drove central banks to seek yet more safety in gold, helping support and raise prices, Western money managers just didn’t feel the fear, cutting their holdings and taking profit instead (as did 
            private bullion investors on Russia's all-out invasion too.)
           

              
           

             This break between ETF flows and gold prices then continued as China’s miserable real-estate and stock-market performance spurred a surge of private Chinese demand this spring.
           

              
           

             More on that another day. Because China really matters. So does India.
           

              
           

             For now, let's not forget what brings our first two Number 1 gold-price drivers together.
              
           
 #1 Gold Driver No.3: Fear and loathing

             The DotCom Crash, 9/11, Iraq's WMDs, Katrina, 7/7, subprime, Northern Rock, Lehmans, the Mumbai attacks, Eurozone crisis...
           

              
           

             ...the first decade of the 21st Century pulled the rug from under public confidence in both government and markets.
           

              
           

             Doubt and fear then only deepened during the Covid pandemic, the following surge of inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hamas' attack on Israel, the flattening of Gaza, Russia 'testing' nuclear-capable missiles, and the ever-growing warnings about how Western government debts (and therefore spending) are simply unsustainable.
           

              
           

             Instead of enjoying '
            the end of history', the world has been living through what can feel more like '
            the end times'. Which is ironic, given the contrast between 
            the giant parties thrown to mark what was popularly known as the Millennium and

2024-12-16,"Title:Trump vs. the 'Deep State' Fed
Article:Economy weak, Fed pushback strong...

 ""NOT PERMITTED under the law,"" snapped Jay Powell, writes Dan Amoss in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 The scene was the Fed's press conference. It was the day after Donald Trump's resounding election victory.
 The reporter, seeking confirmation, followed up. ""Not per-MIT-ted under the law!"" repeated a visibly irritated Powell, slowly enunciating the word.
 Powell's body language said he's ready to battle Trump in the press. I recount this scene to give you a head start in identifying one of Trump's next battles in his multi-year conflict with the Deep State.
 Starting in 2017, the Deep State tried to impeach Trump, undermine his policy goals, slow-walk his orders to the military, and ruin the 2020 economy with COVID lockdowns.
 Most controversially, it's hard to argue that the Deep State didn't inspire the mysterious shooter whose bullet grazed Trump's ear at a fateful July 2024 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. You, me, and the entire world are wondering, ""What will they do next?"" By ""they,"" I am not referring to a pre-planned conspiracy. There is no single evil mastermind running the Deep State – one who has anticipated every possible countermove.
 No, the Deep State is a faceless blob.
 It is a group of government agencies, media outlets, corporations, and people inside those organizations. They understand that Trump's vision for America is disruptive to their preferred way of doing business. Rather than adapt to Trump's priorities, they see it as a sacred duty to resist him.
 Let's return to the role of Fed Chairman Jay Powell. Powell is trying to serve the American public as best he can, even if he's blind to the Fed's role in promoting wealth inequality and inflation.
 Powell's policies have been too soft on asset owners in our overly financialized US economy. The Fed's asset-pumping policies have exacerbated the wealth gap. It eased policy far too much with trillions of Dollars in money printing and its tightening in 2022 and 2023 has not been nearly so dramatic. The wealth gap, powered by the residual money printed in 2021 and 2022, has played a key role in resurrecting Trump's campaign.
 Trump started from a small base of loyal family members and friends on January 6, 2021, rode a tidal wave of public discontent over rampant Biden inflation, and won the popular vote. The remarkable rebound in support for Trump over three years could not have happened if most Americans were happy with the status quo under Biden.
 We know where most of the American public stands. They are financially worn out and frustrated by the pain of cumulative inflation. Their confidence is low, but many are hopeful that Trump will turn things around quickly. However, turning around this economic ship will not be easy, nor will it be costless.
 The economy is like a large ship that's been heading in a specific direction. Even if Trump steers it sharply in a different, more production-oriented direction, it will take time to see material results.
 Meanwhile, Biden's advisors have for years been steering the economic ship in the direction of bloated government spending, government jobs, and malinvestment in green energy.
 I think it's important to keep this in mind when thinking about Trump's goals starting in 2025: There is a global imbalance between production and consumption, and it's been growing for decades. I support Trump's vision to reprioritize production in America. Our multi-decade trend toward over-consuming with too many government jobs and service jobs is unhealthy and unstable. We've done this while exporting bonds and stocks to foreign producers to fund this consumption.
 Bonds and stocks are securities with explicit or implicit promises to deliver streams of cash flow. Bonds are explicit, pre-defined streams of cash flow. Stocks are implicit promises of future cash flow in the form of dividends.
 Here's why stocks are so volatile: It's difficult – even for diligent professionals – to estimate how large and sustainable their dividends will be for decades into the future. In an all-too-common example, a company that goes bankrupt within a few years of an investor buying its stock rarely pays enough dividends for that investor to recoup his investment in that stock before it goes to zero.
 With that context established, I'll say this: Achieving Trump's vision to reprioritize production in America will involve pain for an economy with an unhealthy addiction to bubbly asset prices.
 There is no easy path to revitalizing American manufacturing. Compromises will be required either way.
 The fact is, the pain from restructuring a bloated federal government means the risk of a recession is high. And when recession risks rise, the Fed slashes rates and gold typically surges higher."
2024-12-13,"Title:Will Tariffs Trigger Inflation?
Article:Here's what investors should know...

 AS FAMILIES gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving last month, there was a morsel of good news for consumers, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 The cost of the traditional feast fell for the second year in a row. A classic Turkey Day dinner for 10 cost $58.08, down 5% from last year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation's (AFBF) annual survey.
 That should come as welcome relief, but before we raise a toast to declining prices, keep in mind that costs are still nearly 20% higher than they were just five years ago.
 Could we be on the cusp of another wave of rising costs? If President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other key trade partners come to fruition, the answer may well be yes.
 History teaches us that tariffs – while well-intentioned as tools for protectionist policies – tend to raise consumer prices. And the American dinner table may once again feel the squeeze.
 Among Trump's proposals is a sweeping 60% tariff on all goods imported from China and a 25%-tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada. The tariffs will remain on Mexican and Canadian goods until the two countries crack down on their ""ridiculous Open Borders,"" Trump says.
 Most economists agree that these policies, if enacted, would result in higher costs for US consumers. After all, tariffs are essentially taxes on imports, and the importing businesses typically pass those costs on to the end consumer.
 The size of the impact would depend on the specifics. A hypothetical 10% tariff on all goods entering the US would increase overall prices by an estimated 1.3% annually, according to UBS. Selective tariffs targeting specific goods or countries could be even more disruptive, especially if supply chains can't adjust quickly enough to avoid the additional costs.
 Consider the washing machine tariffs imposed during Trump's first term. From February to May 2018, the price of laundry equipment in the US rose a massive 16.4% – the largest three-month price jump in 40 years of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. Twelve months after the tariffs were in place, Americans were paying roughly $100 more per washing machine and dryer.
 Similarly, the broader trade war with China raised costs for everything from electronics to furniture, adding an estimated $3.2 billion per month in additional taxes for American consumers.
 The same could happen again, but on an even more dramatic scale. Under Trump's trade policies, a pair of $80 jeans could cost between $10 and $16 extra, while a $50 tricycle could cost an additional $18-$28 more, according to a new report by the National Retail Federation (NRF).
 Trump's proposed tariffs have significant implications for much more than just Thanksgiving dinners. If you believe tariffs are going to drive up prices on imported goods, consider stocking up now on items likely to be affected: toys, household appliances, apparel and even travel goods.
 Investors should watch this space closely. Industries with lots of exposure to imported goods – retail, electronics and even agriculture – could face significant headwinds. China, Mexico and Canada are three of the US's largest trading partners, and disrupting these relationships could lead to ripple effects across commodities markets, manufacturing and technology sectors.
 On the other hand, companies that produce goods domestically or operate in sectors less sensitive to global trade could find opportunities in a high-tariff climate. US manufacturers that compete with imports could see increased demand due to higher prices on foreign alternatives.
 Among steel producers, for instance, think Nucor or US Steel. Higher material costs could also encourage more recycling, potentially boosting profits for scrap metal firms such as Radius Recycling (formerly Schnitzer Steel Industries) and Steel Dynamics.
 Trump's tariff proposals will likely dominate headlines in the New Year. Whether they are implemented in full, selectively or through compromise remains to be seen. What should be clear, though, is that these policies will carry costs – not just for consumers but for the economy as a whole.
 At US Global Investors, we're keeping a close eye on these developments. Tariffs may put a damper on personal finances, but smart planning and diversification can help ensure investors are prepared for whatever comes next."
2024-12-11,"Title:Hey, Loser! How to Win at Investing
Article:Diversification as portfolio protection...

 A QUESTION for you, says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 In the context of your savings and investments, do you want to be a winner, or do you want to avoid being a loser?
 An awful lot hangs on your response.
 Peter Bernstein's book 'Against the Gods' is not just recommended but compulsory reading for investors who are interested in the broader history of risk.
 One of the defining moments of our career was stumbling on the advice offered within it by the 'Renaissance Man' polymath Daniel Bernoulli. Bernoulli offered the following counsel to those involved in managing the wealth of others:
 ""The practical utility of any gain in portfolio value inversely relates to the size of the portfolio.""
 In other words, as a general rule, the more people have, the less they need by way of subsequent return. Or to put it another way, in terms that have been validated by the work of Nobel laureates after Bernoulli, wealthy people should be more concerned with capital preservation – in real terms, of course – than with future capital growth.
 'Wealthy' is clearly a somewhat subjective term, but we can all relate to the concept of keeping what you have versus putting all of it at risk. This capital preservation approach is all the more important when it relates to those investors who no longer receive regular income by way of paid employment. That is to say, it's especially relevant for retirees and pensioners, who have pots of sacred assets that simply cannot be replaced.
 One of the reasons that Bernoulli's advice made such an impact on us was that we came across it during the first dotcom bubble, i.e. the period in the late 1990s through to early 2000 and the Nasdaq bust. At the time, everybody seemed to be amassing huge wealth, quickly, through the ownership of speculative internet stocks. In the words of Lord Overstone,
 ""No warning on Earth can save people determined to grow suddenly rich.""
 We suspect that you can pretty much boil the entire stock market down into two fundamental types of participants: those who want to beat the market (or who at least express their performance in market-relative terms) and those, like ourselves, who want to generate a decent absolute return but who don't want to share in the market's inevitable drawdowns at a ratio of 1:1 when they occur.
 In other words, our own investment objective is to try and secure as much of the upside potential available through the stock market whilst at the same time trying to protect the downside as far as practicable.
 The problem with the aspiration to 'win at all costs' (i.e. to beat the market by a meaningful margin) is two-fold. Firstly, it's extraordinarily difficult (though not impossible – Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and the Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville did actually exist); secondly, you have to accept that in trying to beat the market, by taking more risk than the market, you also run the risk of losing more than the market when things go south.
 That's not a risk we're willing to take with our own money, and it's not a risk we're willing to take, at least consciously, with that of our clients.
 How bad can underperformance relative to the market be? Consider the drawdown incurred by US equity investors who owned the market in the form of the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the Great Crash of 1929.
 In the first instance, the drawdown they suffered between 1929 and 1932 equated to one of 89%. Secondly, US equity investors who owned ""the market"" at its peak in 1929 weren't made whole again in real terms until 1954. They had to wait 26 years just to get their money back – assuming that they didn't panic and sell out in desperation at the low, which many of them likely did.
 If this sounds bad, and it clearly is, now consider how expensive the US stock market is today.
 
 Robert Shiller's cyclically adjusted (i.e. smoothed over the course of a prior decade to take account of the vagaries of the volatility in short-term corporate earnings) price / earnings ratio for the S&P 500 index – more representative of the entire US economy than that of the 30-stock Dow – now stands at roughly 37 times, or more expensive than it was in 1929 and only lower than its prevailing level during the first dotcom bubble.
 Its long run average for the past 150 years is roughly 17 times. We are at more than twice that level today.
 The late 1990s showed us that the Shiller p/e can remain unnaturally elevated for a while. And we're not in denial about the 'new economy' and the capital-light model that can be exploited in some cases to achieve global scale quickly by digital businesses (though it turns out AI is fantastically and expensively energy-intensive).
 Our point is somewhat subtler: We don't think that human nature quickly changes. And we believe in reversion to the mean.
 Interest rates have started to rise over the past couple of years after three-and-a-half decades of trending down towards zero. Most fund managers have never experienced a higher interest rate cycle.
 So we make no apology for focusing on a 'safety first' approach towards managing your investments. Our focus is and will always be on capital preservation as much as on future capital growth, and we define capital preservation as primarily a focus on defensive value with some form of margin of safety.
 You can try and be a winner, and put a significant part of your savings pot at risk. Or you can try not to be a loser, and focus on an absolute return (cash-plus or inflation-plus) objective instead.
 Our thesis is that over the long run, by avoiding the big drawdowns consistent with market-relative investing, we may well end up beating the market anyway – by preserving more capital during the downturns than index-relative investors do. It then becomes a matter of compounding at an overall higher rate, because we manage to avoid some of the wrenching and inevitable losses that occur during bear markets, and from which it can be sometimes very difficult ever to recover. The post-1929 experience being a case in point.
 There are some specific aspects to our 'not losing' thesis. One is that a properly diversified investment portfolio in 2024 should include 'value' equities (shares in cheap but high quality listed businesses); systematic trend-following funds (uncorrelated to stock and bond markets); and real assets, notably the monetary metals, gold and silver, and related investments trading, again, cheaply versus their historic range.
 Why 'value' equities?
 Because common stocks have, over the last two centuries, been one of the best-performing assets to own, at least in the context of the US and UK markets. Other regions haven't been so lucky. The refinement is then to concentrate primarily on 'value' stocks – i.e. shares of high quality businesses run by principled, shareholder-friendly management with a track record of generating strong shareholder returns, but only when those shares can be bought at a meaningful discount to their inherent value.
 Why systematic trend-following funds? The investment world has got more risky, not less, since the Global Financial Crisis. Global politics are a mess, and a rising interest rate cycle will play merry hell with traditional portfolios, and not least with bonds. Managers pursuing an unconstrained (long and short) diversified trading thesis will be more appropriate than plodding index-trackers. The time to use index-trackers will be after the next major correction, when markets are once again objectively cheap.
 Why 'real assets' and the monetary metals? Because we believe in sound money. Gold and silver have always been ""money good"" – nobody has ever been forced to use them as money; their use arose spontaneously in free markets and economies over thousands of years. Governments today have to use the rule of law and coercion to get us to pay our taxes (and pretty much everything else) in fiat currency. Given the extent to which the debt markets have continued to expand since 2008, we suspect that the next phase in this rolling financial predicament will be highly inflationary, as governments continue to prime the monetary pump to avoid a gigantic reset (which may come anyway). Gold and silver, of course, cannot be printed.
 As Mohamed El-Erian points out in 'The Financial Times' ('Why the west should be paying more attention to the gold price', 21 October 2024):
 ""Gold's 'all-weather' characteristic signals something that goes beyond economics, politics and higher-frequency geopolitical developments. It captures an increasingly persistent behavioural trend among China and ""middle power"" countries, as well as others.
 ""Over the past 12 months, the price of an ounce of gold on international markets has increased from $1947 to $2715, a gain of almost 40 per cent. Interestingly, this march up in price has been relatively linear, with any pullback attracting more buyers. It has occurred despite some wild swings in expected policy rates, a wide fluctuation band for benchmark US yields, falling inflation and currency volatility.
 ""What is at stake here is not just the erosion of the Dollar's dominant role but also a gradual change in the operation of the global system. No other currency or payment system is able and willing to displace the Dollar at the core of the system and there is a practical limit to reserve diversification. But an increasing number of little pipes are being built to go around this core; and a growing number of countries are interested and increasingly involved.
 ""What has been happening to the gold price is not just unusual in terms of traditional economic and financial influences. It also goes beyond strict geopolitical influences to capture a broader phenomenon which is building secular momentum.
 ""As it develops deeper roots, this risks materially fragmenting the global system and eroding the international influence of the Dollar and the US financial system. That would have an impact on the US's ability to inform and influence outcomes, and undermine its national security. It is a phenomenon that western governments should pay more attention to.""
 There is one crucial caveat to this diversified and 'value' approach, however. It requires patience – especially with regard to the 'value' equity component.
 Would you have sold?
 That caveat about requiring patience, though, bears repeating. Perhaps the best way of expressing it is via the 1970s performance of Berkshire Hathaway stock – one of the best performing US equity investments of the last 50 years – versus the market.
 The data below shows you how you would have fared if you'd put $10,000 into shares of Berkshire Hathaway and $10,000 into the S&P 500 stock index in 1971. It tells something of a story.
  The figures should speak for themselves. Warren Buffett is a multi-billionaire because of this long-term outperformance of the market.
 But in 1971, you didn't know what the future would hold. What you did experience, by holding Berkshire Hathaway until 1975, was losing half of your money, even while the rest of the market recovered, and 4 years of dismal returns.
 Simple question. In the light of just those four years of data alone, what do you honestly think you would have done? Would you have sold?
 Which is why it's crucial to take the long view. Markets are not entirely efficient, nor are they entirely rational.
 What matters to us, as shareholders in any company, is how the company is performing at an operational level. Is it still making decent profits? Is it still using its cash wisely?
 For as long as the company is operating decently or better, we try not to care too much about the stock price. The company can control its profits (more or less) but it can do next to nothing about controlling its stock price. That is almost entirely in the hands of the mob.
 No matter how much money you have and no matter how smart you are, there are only so many things you can do to protect your financial future. There is always something that can catch you unawares.
 There is also a pervasive sense among the electorates of the West that they have somehow been cheated by the forces of 'crony capitalism' – and we share that resentment. As Jeffrey Tucker writes for the Brownstone Institute:
 ""The global Covid response was the turning point in public trust, economic vitality, citizen health, free speech, literacy, religious and travel freedom, elite credibility, demographic longevity, and so much more. Now five years following the initial spread of the virus that provoked the largest-scale despotisms of our lives, something else seems to be biting the dust: the postwar neo-liberal consensus itself.""
 Peter St Onge, for the same platform, writes:
 ""Authoritarianism is back across the West – from Europe to the Biden-Harris censorship regime that would fit perfectly in Communist China.
 ""I think many of us were surprised during Covid to realize just what the supposedly liberal West has become: Essentially the Soviet Union but with better uniforms.""
 The politics of our time have now become hopelessly polarised and admit, seemingly, to no compromise on anything. That leaves the very real threat of an ultimately undelivered Brexit and – almost infinitely worse still – the threat of unreconstructed Marxist governments across the supposedly developed world.
 So the real impact of the Global Financial Crisis has only just started to be felt at a social level. This is in part what happens when governments fail to address major problems in a serious way, the first time around.
 In a justly famous essay, Charles 'Charley' Ellis, the investment consultant who founded Greenwich Associates, pointed out, citing the work of scientist Simon Ramo in the process, that there was not in fact one game of tennis, but two. There was tennis as played by the professionals, and then tennis as played by the rest of us.
 In the professional game, the player wins points. In the amateur game, the player loses points.
 Professional tennis players are a dream to watch, as they vault, dive, lunge and volley. They rarely make errors.
 Amateur tennis players: not so much.
 The tennis pro is playing a winner's game. Victory is down to winning more points than your opponent. The amateur is playing a loser's game. Victory is achieved, and not very stylishly, by getting a higher score than your opponent, because he or she loses more points than you do. Amateur tennis is a game full of errors.
 Ramo even tallied the scores. The verdict: in professional tennis, about 80 percent of the points are won. In amateur tennis, roughly 80 percent of the points are lost, i.e. in unforced errors.
 For the amateur tennis player, the best strategy for victory is to avoid mistakes. The best way to avoid mistakes is to be conservative and keep the ball in play. Give the other player enough rope to hang himself.
 Clearly the analogy is useful for the private investor versus the alleged professional.
 Although human nature doesn't change, the composition of the financial markets has evidently changed over the past century. Ellis suggests that during the 1930s and 1940s – a period during which the work of the value investor Benjamin Graham would come to growing prominence – preservation of capital and prudent investment approaches would come to dominate. The bull market of the 1950s attracted new types of aggressive, hot money investors. The people who were drawn to the Wall Street of the 1960s had always been winners – in debating teams or in sports teams. But as the markets sucked in more and more winners and people who urgently wanted to win, the dynamic of the markets changed.
 In the 10 years prior to Ellis' 1975 essay, institutional investors went from representing 30 percent of the turnover on Wall Street to 70 percent.
 Ellis' advice to anyone trying to beat the professionals at their own game?

 Know your investment policies very well and play according to them consistently. Let the other fellow make the mistakes. Let him track the benchmarks – leave your own portfolio entirely unconstrained.
 Keep it simple. In the words of the golfer Tommy Armour, ""Play the shot you've got the greatest chance of playing well."" Wait for the fat pitch. Do nothing otherwise. This is a luxury the institutional fund manager does not have.
 Focus on defence. In a loser's game, researchers should spend most of their time making sell decisions, not purchases. To put it another way, limit your number of purchases. Better a concentrated portfolio where each of the positions is well understood, than a 'diworsified' portfolio consisting of little or no underlying investment conviction. Data strongly suggest that the optimal number of portfolio holdings is around 16 or so. (Within our fund and within our discretionary portfolios, we target between roughly 15 and 30 holdings.) Many successful investors get by with less than 10. You don't need to own ""the market"". A focused portfolio of high conviction stocks is something you can hold that most professional investors simply can't.
 Don't take it personally. ""Most of the people in the investment business are ""winners"" who have won all their lives by being bright, articulate, disciplined and willing to work hard. They are so accustomed to succeeding by trying harder and are so used to believing that failure to succeed is the failure's own fault that they may take it personally when they see that the average professionally managed fund cannot keep pace with the market.."" You don't have to worry about peer group performance. There's no rush – you just need to shepherd your capital so that you can stay in the game.

Value investing gives you an automatic edge over most market professionals because it's a game very few of them can even play. They don't have the luxury of time, and they don't have the flexibility to go off benchmark and invest freely into the best opportunities. They are more concerned with keeping their jobs and running with the herd than with maximising returns.
 In summary, ask yourself two questions: what does it cost? And how much is it worth? Then quietly ask yourself a third: do I sincerely want to be rich? And finally ask yourself a fourth: do I sincerely want to stay rich?"
2024-12-09,"Title:US Stocks Trump the World
Article:But will Trump 2.0 mean the end...?

 PRESIDENT TRUMP will re-enter office at a very interesting time for US stock markets, says Adam Sharp in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 America is absolutely torching the rest of the world.
 Today American companies make up a whopping 75% of the MSCI World Index. It contains shares of the largest stocks from Europe, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Israel, and the United States.
 
 The MSCI World Index is a very important index, as it forms the basis of large ETFs and other investment vehicles. Today it's utterly dominated by American companies.
 Over recent history, American stocks have dramatically outperformed the rest of the world, especially Europe.
 US stocks have returned almost 4x more than European ones over the last 14 years!
 It's been a historic winning spree of performance. Now the question is...
 Can it last?
  Take a look at our charts again.
 Notice that, at the top, Japan made up over 50% of the MSCI World Index in the late 1980s. It was bigger than the US!
 A tiny country with around 126 million people had a majority of the World Index. And now it's less than 7%.
 We can see that during the period of Japanese exceptionalism (it peaked in 1989), the US dropped from about 70% to 30% of the MSCI World Index. Times do change, eventually.
 I believe we're nearing another peak of US market exceptionalism. I'm not saying it's going to be immediate, but make no mistake, stocks can't go up like this forever.
 US stocks have reached ridiculous valuation levels. Take a look at a simple stock like Walmart (WMT). The retail giant is currently trading at 38x earnings (a 38 P/E), while growing revenue at 5%. That's rich. A great company, no doubt. But a very expensive valuation, especially considering the upcoming changes to American tariffs.
 We're in serious bubble territory across the board. The S&P 500 has an average price/book of over 5.2x. The top 10 stocks in the US trade at about 49x earnings on average.
 In about 45 days, President Trump will take office. Markets are (validly) excited about this prospect. But we should tamper our expectations given the pre-existing bubbly conditions.
 Voters have charged him with bringing about the most ambitious reforms the country has seen in decades if not a century.
 Trade policy will be overhauled. Immigration policy will change dramatically.
 Immigration and trade alone have the potential to reshape the American workforce and economy.
 Add in better energy policy (drill baby, drill), lower taxes, and RFK Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, and we have a recipe for fireworks.
 Trump will also enter office at a time in which US tech companies are beginning to face serious foreign (mostly Chinese) competition. Take a look at Apple iPhone sales in China, which are finally facing major challengers such as Huawei And Xiaomi. In social media, companies such as TikTok parent Bytedance are cutting in on a previously US-dominated market. And in electric vehicles, Tesla is losing out to rising giants like BYD.
 Oh yeah, and as I've already mentioned, we are also in the middle of a massive stock bubble.
 It's going to be an incredibly disruptive next few years. Good, great, bad, and ugly. We're going to see it all.
 Investors face a daunting task preparing for such conditions. This period promises to be wild and unlike anything we've seen for decades.
 Market crashes, real reform, political clashes, buying opportunities, the deep state strikes back. All of that."

Article:Little reported among the 'strong' jobs data...

 NOVEMBER's payrolls report from the BLS was never in doubt for the USA's massive consumerist/services economy, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Two notables are that manufacturing kicked up after having been negative over the last 12 months, and government hiring remained accelerated. What gives?
 Was there a knee-jerk in manufacturing hiring because of Trump's win and its implications for deregulated corporations, tax breaks for corporations gave the all-clear?
 Was it a usual pre-holiday bump? Or was it legacy hiring initiatives that were already in play, too late to be walked back by the lame duck democrat administration after the election loss?
 Same question for the inexplicable government hiring during a month when all the air came out of the party in power's balloon, deflating it into lame duck status. Were these contracted government hires, set before the election results? I'll go with that as my guess.
 All in all, it seems strange. But it is what it is, pending the likely downward revisions that tend to come later, in the shadows.
 
 Meanwhile, the slow-moving unemployment rate is still doing its base/bottom/upturn thing as an officially recognized recession creeps forward...

2024-12-05,"Title:Trump's S&P500 Crushes Gold
Article:Stocks jump vs. gold price, but only US...

 HAVE YOU heard the news? gasps Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 America is going to be great again! The people have spoken and the man with the simple but catchy buzz phrase is back in office.
 Pay no attention to the fact that he is going to use well worn and unsuccessful tricks of trade wars past, or that he is going to increase the already incalculable national debt trying to stimulate the appearance of ""America great again"" for the average Joe.
 It's not going to work. You know it. I know it, and anyone with a modicum of economic sophistication knows it.
 But do you know who doesn't know it? The men, women, machines and casino patrons that make up the sponsorship of the Good Ship Lollipop's signature index, the S&P500.
 
 It is no surprise, given great-again America, that the S&P500 is the only equity/asset market on this chart that gold's standing is not still constructive against (along with many others not included on this chart).
 This despite the utter hammering for gold. (Just kidding; it is a normal correction and would be healthy even if gold visits 2400, as is quite possible, if not probable.)
 You might want to keep an eye on the first panel above, as it will be very important in determining if the markets are going to play the ""America great again"" theme straight or put a nice contrarian stake right through its heart in the coming weeks/months (inauguration day is a month+ away). Dollars to donuts when the president-elect talks about greatness, he is not talking about the US Dollar, because everything he says he stands for economically (protectionism, low interest rates, tax cuts funded by increasing Trillions in debt) is antithetical to a strong Dollar.
 But so far, Uncle Buck has his own ideas as he waits for his fellow rider of liquidity Apocalypse to to decide on a direction (northerly or southerly?).
 
 If gold does take over leadership from silver and the US Dollar holds this breakout and screams higher the indication will be that large swaths of the macro – if not the vast majority of it – will come under great stress. The correction in gold could be leading just that as the precious metals often lead other areas due to greater forward-looking liquidity sensitivity.
 As for any bullishness in nominal precious metals and miners, patience could be needed. But the indication will be that oh yeah, the fundamentals are just fine and setting up for the ultimate contrarian play, after the damage is done and the DUST settles (pun intended).
 So keep an eye on the relationship above. Break down, and party on. Go the other way and not party on.
 I love this market right now because much like the good ole' US of A, it's got potential for much mayhem in 2025.
 I'm not saying I love the mayhem. But I do like a fucked up market that is – by outward appearances – unmanageable. It can be fun if you're patient and then prepared.
 Yes, pain, I know. Real people, real lives, I know. But I did not create this giant Ponzi scheme. I simply work with it and interpret it. It's my job."

Article:Most gold buyers since July 2022...


              
           


GOLD's first monthly price drop since June saw Western investors buy more gold than they sold in November, snapping 14 months of net profit-taking on BullionVault, 
            writes Adrian Ash at the world's leading precious metals marketplace for private investment.


              
           

             BullionVault now cares for $5.0 billion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium (£3.9bn, €4.7bn), all securely custodied, insured and audited for more than 110,000 users from 175 countries. Nine-in-10 of them live in North America or Western Europe.
           

              
           

             First-time investing held strong in November as gold edged back from this fall's fresh all-time highs, with the number of new users running 59.5% above the 12-month average.
           

              
           

             In total, more people chose to buy gold using BullionVault than any time in almost 2.5 years. That helped push up the 
            Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of 'revealed preference' in private-investor gold demand – to its highest since June 2023.
           

              
           




              
           

             Now that the US election is decided, the investment risks for 2025 are becoming clearer, starting with currency-market volatility.
           

              
           

             So gold's retreat from its latest all-time highs is giving would-be buyers the chance to start building a position. That's offsetting continued profit-taking by longer-term holders.
           

              
           

             November saw more people choose to buy gold across the month than any time since July 2022, back when gold cost almost $900 less than today's $2640 per Troy ounce  (£640 from today's £2090, €820 from €2525). Rising 8.2% from October's figure, that contrasted with the number of sellers falling 14.8% to the fewest in 3 months.
           

              
           

             Together, that drove up the Gold Investor Index – now tracking the balance of buyers over sellers on BullionVault every month since October 2009 – to a 17-month high of 55.1, rising by 1.5 points.
           

              
           

             Any reading above 50.0 signals more buyers than sellers. The Gold Investor Index hit a decade peak of 65.9 as the Covid Crisis struck in March 2020, and it set a series low of 47.5 on record-heavy profit taking this March.
           

              
           

             November's post-election surge in the Dollar on the currency market helped knocked prices to invest in gold 3.0% lower from October's fresh record finish, which had marked the 4th new month-end high in a row. But gold priced in Euros edged only 0.2% lower as the price in UK Pounds dropped 1.6%.
           

              
           

             The number of first-time users of BullionVault slipped by 13.5% worldwide from 
            October's 55-month high, but it ran 59.5% ahead of the 12-month average, led by continued strength in the UK, France and the Netherlands.
           

              
           

             New US investors remained low in comparison, falling 20.0% from October's count and running just 18.2% above the 12-month average.
           

              
           

             By weight, BullionVault users as a group were net buyers of gold for the first time in 15 months, albeit of only 17.5 kilograms. That took client holdings – all securely custodied, insured and audited in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or most popular Zurich – up towards 44.2 tonnes worth $3.7 billion (£2.9bn, €3.5bn).
           

              
           

             While that means customer gold holdings have shrunk 5.9% by weight so far this year, they have risen 21.0% in Dollar terms (21.2% in GBP, 26.7% in EUR).
           

              
           




              
           

             The Silver Investor Index also jumped as the price of bullion retreated in November, with the number of buyers rising 3.3% to the most since July 2022 (when silver traded at $19.08) while the number of sellers sank by 36.8% to a 3-month low with its steepest drop since June.
           

              
           

             That put the index at a 21-month high of 54.0, exactly 3.0 points higher from October, as the silver price dropped 8.6% in Dollar terms (-6.6% in GBP, -5.9% in EUR), its steepest fall since February last year.
           

              
           

             By weight, BullionVault users added almost 8.0 tonnes of silver, the single heaviest 1-month inflow since January. That reversed 28.0% of the prior 2 months' liquidation and took client holdings to just above 1,154 tonnes worth $1.1bn (£897m, €1.0bn).
           

              
           

             What next for precious metals? 2024 has been a remarkable year, repeating in miniature the consensus-defying jump in gold which continues to make it the best-performing asset of the 21st Century to date.
           

              
           

             Extending that performance might sound tough, if not impossible. But no one saw gold and silver prices surging as they have since the year 2000, nor again in 2024. And for new investors, the price you missed doesn't matter.
           

              
           

             What counts for today's buyers is what physical bullion's track record says it might do when the next crisis strikes. 2025 looks sure to bring new risks and volatility across the wider financial markets."
2024-12-01,"Title:Gold Says Silver's Cheap
Article:Ratio out of historical whack...

 IN 2023 global silver production was approximately 26,000 metric tons, writes Adam Sharp in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 During the same period, gold production was around 3,000 tonnes.
 So 8.6x more silver is mined annually than gold. Yet gold trades at about 86x the price of silver today ($2633/oz for gold and $30.60/oz for silver).
 What explains this disconnect? The primary differentiator is the fact that central banks buy and hold large quantities of gold. Global central banks and governments hold approximately 36,700 tons, or roughly 17% of all gold ever mined.
 It doesn't really seem like that much – just 17%. But that percentage makes a world of difference in markets. Even single-digit moves in supply/demand can dramatically impact hard asset prices. When central banks hold nearly a fifth of global supply and are buying more, that matters greatly.
 Gold remains a monetary asset today, and I believe there's a good chance we return to some version of the gold standard in the future.
 Silver, on the other hand, has lost its monetary mojo (for now).
 Yet historically, both gold and silver were money. Take a look at this infographic which shows the gold/silver ratio at various points in history.
 
 As you can see, the historical ratios were more proportional to the relative scarcity of these precious metals in the ground (roughly 1:8 today).
 For much of history, gold was used for large purchases such as real estate, and silver for everyday expenses. Even up until 1964 in the US, silver was an important part of our coinage.
 I believe that eventually, silver will also re-emerge as a personal monetary asset. Individual investors will catch on that we're headed for a financial reset.
 They will want to put their money into something analog. A hard asset that can't be hacked.
 But some people want something with more upside than gold, while still offering the safety of precious metals.
 Silver fits the bill beautifully.
 Today, demand for silver is once again booming, but not for monetary purposes (yet).
 As we can see in the latest Silver Institute report, physical investment demand for silver is currently dropping.
 Physical investment is forecast to fall by 15% to a four-year low of 208Moz in 2024. Losses have been concentrating in the US where coin and bar sales are on track for a 40% decline to its lowest level since 2019. This reflects an absence of new crises during 2024-to-date, which has affected precious metal retail investment across the board.
 Industrial demand, however, is still soaring. In 2024 industrial buying is set to rise 7%, primarily driven by solar panel growth in China.
 ETF demand is also rising, reflecting growing investor interest in that area. It's set to rise 8% vs 2023, the first inflow in years. This is a good sign.
 Overall silver is running record annual deficits, and this is expected to continue.
 When physical silver investment turns the corner, I expect fireworks. With industrial demand so high, it only takes a little growth from investment demand to send the metal much higher.
 When it comes to silver investment demand, the strongest catalyst is financial or monetary chaos. Things like sustained inflation, banking crisis, sovereign default.
 I am certain that the world won't lack for crises as this decade proceeds. Governments around the globe have reached a tipping point of debt and deficit.
 Banks have massive unrealized losses in their fixed-income portfolios, which everyone is essentially ignoring. Interest rates are rising despite Fed rate cuts, exacerbating the losses.
 The US is about to dramatically change its foreign trade policies, which is certain to be a disruptive force. In the long run, tariffs will encourage domestic production and raise wages, but in the short term, there will be side effects.
 Silver performed remarkably well during the first inflation wave over the past few years. In 2020, silver bottomed out at around $11.60. Today it trades at $30.60, down from a recent high of nearly $35.
 The current correction offers a nice buying opportunity, but there's a chance we go lower. If we do, I plan on buying aggressively."

Article:USA makes 40% of global defense spending...


              
           


WITH President-elect Donald Trump set to assume office in January, the US military and cybersecurity sectors could experience sweeping changes, creating opportunities for investors who recognize the long-term growth potential in defense and technology, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             In his first term, President Trump left his mark on the US military, establishing the Space Force and boosting defense spending to historic highs.
           

              
           

             Now, as he prepares for his second term, his administration's ambitious goals – such as potentially creating an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield system – signal a renewed focus on military modernization.
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, cyber threats have reached an all-time high, requiring unprecedented investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. For investors, these trends highlight two critical sectors poised for growth: traditional defense and the emerging field of cyber defense.
           

              
           

             In 2023, US military expenditure reached $916 billion, representing a staggering 40% of global military spending. As I shared with you earlier in the year, that's more than the next 10 countries combined.
           

              
           

             Despite this eye-popping figure, US defense spending as a share of GDP has been falling steadily for decades and recently hit an historic low, a function of the US economy growing faster than military spending.
           

              
           




              
           

             I believe this highlights an important point: While the US spends more on defense than any other nation, there's still room for growth, particularly as new threats emerge on both physical and virtual battlefields.
           

              
           

             The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that military spending will increase 10% between 2028 and 2038, adjusted for inflation. But Republicans could accelerate this timeline, with bold initiatives like the proposed Iron Dome-style missile defense system.
           

              
           

             The potential for increased defense budgets isn't limited to the US NATO allies, under renewed pressure from an incoming Trump administration, are likely to ramp up their own spending.
           

              
           

             Germany, for example, has already met NATO's 2% GDP defense target for the first time in decades, and public opinion now supports raising it even further to between 3% and 3.5%. Poland currently leads the alliance by spending a whopping 4.12% of GDP on defense, and next year, that figure is expected to rise to 5%.
           

              
           

             While traditional military spending captures the headlines, the cybersecurity sector represents an equally important – and arguably more urgent, I think – investment opportunity. Recent data by Check Point Software Technologies reveals that cyberattacks have skyrocketed, with the average number of weekly attacks climbing 75% globally year-over-year, to hit a record high of 1,876 per organization. In the US, attacks are up 56% from 2023 levels, averaging 1,300 per organization weekly.
           

              
           




              
           

             The culprits aren't just rogue hackers but state-sponsored actors from powerful nations like China, Russia and Iran, according to Microsoft's Digital Defense Report 2024.
           

              
           

             These adversaries are no longer content with merely breaching corporate networks. They target critical infrastructure, telecommunications and even political figures. A recent campaign by Chinese state-sponsored hackers infiltrated the phones of Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance and Vice President Kamala Harris, underscoring the growing national security implications of these attacks.
           

              
           

             As businesses, governments and individuals race to protect themselves from these threats, the need for robust cybersecurity will only increase. For investors, this means that companies developing cutting-edge technology to secure networks and data could be positioned for explosive growth.
           

              
           

             Defense and cybersecurity budgets tend to receive bipartisan support, but Trump's return could supercharge growth. His track record – and his recent, controversial nomination of Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary – suggests a willingness to take bold steps to reshape the US military and strengthen the nation's defenses against 21st-century threats.
           

              
           

             As we look ahead to 2024 and beyond, it's clear that military and cybersecurity spending are on an upward trajectory. The challenges of tomorrow – whether they come in the form of hypersonic missiles or sophisticated cyberattacks – require innovative solutions and significant investment. For investors, this represents not just a challenge but an opportunity."
2024-11-19,"Title:Trading the Melt-Up? Pros Take Profit
Article:How to trade stock-market surge into 2025...


              
           


The SHARP ELECTION rally has given way to some volatility as investors digest the moves, fill some gaps, and nervously wait to see what stocks and sectors bounce first, 
            says Greg Guenther in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             It's easy to start feeling a little bearish here. The percentage of S&P components above their respective 50-day moving averages recently slipped below 60% as many high-flying names appeared to hit a wall. Smaller stocks, biotechs, growth breakouts – all of these groups were hit hard heading into the new trading week.
           

              
           

             Despite the recent weakness, stocks remain on track to eventually bounce and attack their highs. November is a seasonally strong month, especially for small-caps (which have taken a big hit following their election breakout). The same goes for the Dow. Both are outperforming the S&P and the Nasdaq Composite halfway through the month.
           

              
           

             We're seeing indexes and key names sitting at key levels. If they bounce, it's game on. If they begin to fail, we'll need to reassess. It's that simple.
           

              
           

             But it would be foolish to turn our backs on the bulls right now without any confirmation that the market is indeed breaking down and set to move lower.
           

              
           

             My end-of-year stock market playbook is simple: grab onto the plays most likely to melt-up into 2025 and ride them as far as they will take you. In these market conditions, your best bet at booking outsized gains will likely come from the most speculative stocks and sectors.
           

              
           

             First, know your market conditions, the first step in any risk management plan. Remember, the market is always changing. Therefore, your trading strategies must evolve alongside the prevailing trends.
           

              
           

             For example, a bullish strategy involving any of the speculative growth stocks probably would have failed earlier this year when semiconductors and Big Tech (ahem, NVDA) dominated the leaderboard.
           

              
           

             Similarly, it pays to take profits early and avoid chasing some of the market's wilder breakouts when the averages are choppy or uncooperative (like the conditions we experienced in the late summer months).
           

              
           

             We've already established that we're entering more favorable trading conditions. Barring a broader pullback this week, we're now firmly planted in one of the strongest trading windows of the year. That means breakouts and big moves in stocks are more likely to extend.
           

              
           

             In less favorable conditions, I'm pickier with my trades. If the market is flat or choppy, I'll wait for more confirmation and make smaller trades (usually half-size positions). In stronger markets like we're experiencing right now, I'll take more signals and put on full-size positions.
           

              
           

             Once you nail down the market environment and decide on your position sizing, it's time to think about risk. More specifically, when are you going to bail on your trade if it begins to work against you?
           

              
           

             Most speculators have tunnel vision when it comes to new positions. They only want to think about potential profits.
           

              
           

             But a seasoned trader knows he won't always buy a winner. And the most important thing he can do is protect his account from unnecessary losses.
           

              
           

             That's where stop losses come in. I don't care what method you use – whether it's a moving average, Dollar amount, or a percentage stop – you simply have to have some idea of when you are going to cut and run. Most importantly, you should decide on the level beforeyou enter the trade. This way, your emotions won't be getting the best of you and causing any irrational decisions in the heat of battle.
           

              
           

             Another great way to improve your winning potential is to sell a portion of a short-term trade when it hits a specific profit target. For options swing trades, this might mean locking in half of your gains after the position has doubled. This gives you the ability to let your trade run with house money.
           

              
           

             I'm always sure to let winners run (especially during melt-up season), but not at the expense of leaving open profits unprotected. Professionals understand open profits belong to the market…
           

              
           

             Sure, you can probably find some excellent long-term plays to buy and hold during melt-up season.
           

              
           

             But beaten-down stocks have the potential to be some of your best performing trades in a frothy market. Not only do you get the benefit of a rising tide – speculators are more inclined to take bigger risks and buy stocks they might normally avoid in less favorable conditions.
           

              
           

             These plays can offer big profits over shorter time frames. But there is one catch: many of these lower quality names tend to reverse and underperform over longer time frames. Your best bet is to take profits on these more speculative trades when the market allows.
           

              
           

             My colleague Enrique Abeyta shared a helpful rule when it comes to stocks that offer exceptionally fast gains:
           

              
           

             If a stock doubles in a day, a week, or a month, you sell some. If it doubles in a year or two, you should add to your position.
           

              
           

             I love this piece of advice. Not only is it succinct, it's also accurate. Most incredibly sharp price moves are unsustainable in the long-term. It is highly unlikely for a stock that doubles in a week to consolidate sideways. Instead, it will likely give back a good chunk of its previous move as it works to bleed off the excess momentum.
           

              
           

             Events like these can easily shake out the weak hands of speculators who were not buying into the stock for any fundamental reason. Once the quick profits are gone, they turn tail and run.
           

              
           

             Compare this behavior to a stock that steadily climbs higher over the course of many months as it beats earnings and raises analysts' expectations. That's the kind of action that can help you confidently add to your longer-term position.
           

              
           

             Bottom line: Know what you're buying and when you should take profits."

             Well, not apart from US consumers maybe. And Chinese manufacturers.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""It may be correct to say that the role of the Dollar allows Americans to consume beyond their means,"" wrote former US investment banker and now China-trade-and-economy specialist Michael Pettis back in 2011.
           

              
           

             ""But it is just as correct, and probably more so, to say that 
            foreign accumulations of dollars force Americans to consume beyond their means.""
           

              
           

             That 2011 article from Pettis was called 'An Exorbitant Burden'. It contrasted with the more regular view that the Dollar represents ""an exorbitant privilege""...
           

              
           

             ...a phrase used by the French Government of Charles de Gaulle to complain about US monetary dominance in the 1960s, and an idea repeated today by Russia and China every time they complain about having to pile up Dollars while risking loss of access to those piles through financial sanctions.
           

              
           

             Pettis' more domestically-political view became a book in 2021, co-written with US financial columnist Matthew Klein: 
            Trade Wars Are Class Wars.
           

              
           

             Pay attention. This might matter.
           

              
           

Trade Wars Are Class Wars is an arresting and important book, up there with David Graeber's 
            Debt: The First 5,000 Years and Liaquat Ahamed's 
            Lords of Finance as a must-read for anyone working or interested in money since the global financial crisis. But its power and timing is such that, as a must-read for anyone in politics, it's right up there with Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's 
            This Time is Different.
           

              
           

             Among other things, that 2011 blockbuster famously said that too much government debt kills economic growth. In fact, the economy stops growing and starts shrinking when the state's total debt rises above 90% of GDP.
           

              
           

             You might recall this claim from such political campaigns as the UK Conservatives' in 2010, 2015, 2019 and 2024, or US presidential hopeful Paul Ryan in 2013, or the European Commission time and again. Thing is, it wasn't true.
           

              
           

             Reinhart & Rogoff first 
            presented the 90% rule in New Year 2010. It was seized on by Western governments, most especially in Europe, to cut spending and impose 'austerity' on voters after the banking bail-outs of 2008-2012. But the data rested on a mistake in the Harvard duo's Excel spreadsheets. They took the average of only 15 instead of 20 case studies, missing big success stories which turned that small GDP decline into solid growth overall.
           

              
           

             A 
            post-grad student spotted the error (he also thought they should have better weighted each country's GDP history in their XLS, too), and the news broke out in 2013. That 
            led Rogoff & Reinhart to revise their data in public. But by then, it had already become truth.
           

              
           

             So as John Maynard Keynes said...a man who tried to avoid the Dollar ruling the world after WW2, albeit to defend the UK's fading imperial star:
           

              
           

             ""Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are 
            usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.""
           

              
           

             Defunct is harsh. But here comes J.D.Vance anyway.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""I think you can argue that the Dollar's reserve currency status is a massive subsidy to American consumers but a massive tax on American producers.""
           

              
           

             Now Donald Trump's vice-president, 
            Vance said that in March last year as a junior Senator for Ohio.
           

              
           

             Hearing Vance's comments on the Dollar, ""I think 
            he is a threat to our constitutional government,"" said Pettis' co-author of 
            Trade Wars, Matthew Klein.
           

              
           

             ""But he did read the book.""
           

              
           

             Washington's ruling elite, in contrast, has not. Not yet.
           

              
           

             ""We have the world reserve currency because of our democratic institutions, because of our control over inflation over many, many, many years, and the world trusts the rule of law.""
           

              
           

             So said US central bank boss Jerome Powell last year, replying to Vance during that Federal Reserve appearance before lawmakers.
           

              
           

             The world needs a stable Dollar, in short. And it needs lots of Dollars to keep growing too, because it oils the wheels of global trade and finance. So nothing will change and nor does it need to. Next question.
           

              
           

             Maybe Powell should read the book. The big idea is that, as 
            one review of Trade Wars puts it, preserving the Dollar's No.1 reserve currency status means ""Rust Belt cities must dry up and blow away so the President can starve the Iranian citizenry"" through sanctions.
           

              
           

             Maybe that changes with the new ""madmen"" taking charge in January.
           

              
           

             ""We're done sacrificing supply chains to unlimited global trade,"" declared Vance when he won the GOP's nomination as Trump's running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this July.
           

              
           

             ""We're going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label, 'made in the USA'. We're going to build factories again, put people to work making real products for American families, made with the hands of American workers. Together, 
            we will protect the wages of American workers and stop the Chinese Communist Party from building their middle class on the backs of American citizens.""
           

              
           

             Put another way, ""We have a big currency problem,"" said Trump himself to Bloomberg this summer. ""It's 
            a tremendous burden.""
           

              
           

             Do you think 60% tariffs on Chinese imports will help? Plus 10-20% on everyone else? Anyone? Anyone? 
            Anyone seen this before?


              
           

             Personally I have no expertise or opinion on who's right or wrong. But investors and savers need to play the hand we're dealt, and Trump 2.0 is really going to shuffle the pack.
           

              
           

             China and Russia have so far failed to unseat King Dollar. No other currency stands ready to replace it, and judging by its ongoing dominance, the Dollar's monetary power actually suits the rest of the world (sanctions aside), because it means the USA has to borrow to pay for what it buys.
           

              
           

             But King Trump II and his 2nd-in-command have other ideas. Bad ones for sure, ill-thought through and currently driving the Dollar higher and higher because of the inflation (and therefore higher Fed interest rates) which everyone agrees massive trade tariffs, unfunded tax cuts and the mass deportation of illegal-but-low-wage workers will cause.
           

              
           

             But again...and even as Trump's likely pick for Treasury Secretary says that tariffs are just a negotiation tool, not a promise...King Donald no doubt has other ideas. Lots of them, contradictory and confused, and mostly forgotten between breakfast and lunch. But they're trying to point in the same direction, and they will surely include appointing a new chairman of the Federal Reserve when the current term of Jerome 'high rates' Powell expires in May. 
           

              
           

             ""My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?"" 
            shouted Trump into the air back in 2019 after the Fed failed to slash interest rates as the then-President wished.
           

              
           

             Fast forward 5 years, and who's really the bigger threat to the Dollar:
           

              
           

             Putin or Trump?"
2024-11-16,"Title:Good Gold Stock Drop
Article:'Healthy correction' in HUI...


              
           


WHAT we viewed as a bullish but frothy sector – the precious metals, which had led the post-March broad rally into late October – has finally taken the haircut it needed, says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the 
            Rabbit Hole.
           

              
           

             Or to use another turn of phrase, the precious metals correction, and especially gold stock correction, is sanitizing the sentiment and momentum profiles.
           

              
           

             The Gold Miners Bullish Percent index (BPGDM, not a sentiment gauge so much as a momentum gauge) has indeed taken a haircut off the frothy top.
           

              
           

             Depending on the duration or severity of the correction, the BPGDM may or may not be done declining. But importantly, it means that a good number of miners' charts have triggered point & figure chart ""sell"" signals. That is momentum draining out of the sector, day by day.
           

              
           

             I have added RSI to the chart if for no other reason than it appears RSI, if not the index itself, provided a good negative divergence signal as gold stocks (HUI) continued rising while BPGDM's RSI diverged. 
           

              
           




              
           

             Now RSI is getting toward oversold levels that have – with much grinding and volatility – marked gold stock correction lows. At the very least, BPGDM tells us the sector is well in the process of a healthy correction (ref. the bull market trend in BPGDM noted on the chart).
           

              
           

             Moving on, let's look at the corrective progress HUI is making vs. the Gold/RINF ratio, a gauge of gold's performance in relation to inflation signals and expectations.
           

              
           

             Aside from continually proving wrong those who believe in and tout gold stocks as a way to hedge inflation (as many do in the public and in the gold stock analysis community), this chart shows that as gold has been dropping lately in relation to inflation signals, the miners are doing the right thing and also dropping.
           

              
           

             As you can see, the gold stock correction is dropping HUI harder than the ratio. It is another sign that the sector is getting cleaned of the wrong kind of investors, err, speculators, inflationists, momo freaks, and hangers-on.
           

              
           

              
           




              
           

             A divergence like the one we noted last February (in real time in NFTRH) that preceded the rally may or may not develop here, giving a buy signal.
           

              
           

             It is possible that the sharp decline by HUI relative to Gold/RINF could do the trick with no follow-up divergence building. In other words, this could be more of a flash event than an extended process.
           

              
           

             The gold stock correction has made very good technical progress by hitting levels we noted ahead of time in NFTRH. While the correction is not yet clearly indicated to be over and there are potential targets lower, much price and sentiment risk has come out of the sector to this point. If gold continues to decline in relation to inflation signals, the going could get rougher. If at some point the Gold/RINF ratio stabilizes the miners would have a tailwind developing.
           

              
           

             As a side note, the above are just two of several ways to view gold stocks' internal situation. This is by no means an exhaustive article on the matter.
           

              
           

             NFTRH has managed the gold stock correction since before it began (noting the frothy BPGDM above and the high risk profile of the gold price, among other things). Traders will have sold, investors will have realized that it is likely a correction within a bull market, and I personally trimmed holdings, hedged a couple times and am feeling like scouting opportunity rather than praying the correction will end."

Article:Plus ça change for the almighty Dollar...


              
           


IF I GOT a dollar every time someone said the US Dollar was doomed, I'd have a lot of dollars, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Far more dollars, in fact, than if I'd bet the kids and the mortgage on a Dollar Crash actually happening...
           

              
           

             ...and even more dollars than if I'd got $1 every time someone told me 
            silver prices were about to hit the moon. Which is a lot!
           

              
           

             But that doesn't mean the Dollar will rule forever. Money is always and everywhere a political thing, and politics change. Just very, very slowly.
           

              
           

             I mean, it's taken 8 decades for the USA's government debt to reach and beat the post-WW2 peak above 120% of the nation's annual economic output.
           

              
           

             Only this time, we aren't coming out of a world war. And in New Year 2025, we'll have new people running America, courtesy of Donald Trump's big comeback.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""What the United States owes to foreign countries it pays – at least in part – with Dollars that it can simply issue if it chooses to."" 
           

              
           

             So said 
            French President Charles de Gaulle almost 6 decades ago, back when Washington still backed its Dollars with gold (but not enough of it) and US debt totalled less than half of America's GDP.
           

              
           

             ""This unilateral facility undermines the idea that the Dollar is an impartial and international trade medium. It is in fact a credit instrument reserved for one state only.""
           

              
           

             Plus ça change! you might think...
           

              
           

             ...especially if you listen to 
            Vladimir Putin moaning from the Kremlin about Washington's Dollar dominance and how he's going to overthrow it with a little help from his emerging-market friends.
           

              
           

             ""International relations have entered the era of global, fundamental changes when 
            a new world order is being formed, reflecting the diversity of the whole planet,"" said Russia's war-loving President-forever at last month's BRICS summit of non-Western nations.
           

              
           

             ""This natural process is irreversible"" – and overthrowing the Dollar's dominance is a big part of that switch. Or it would be, if it was actually happening.
           

              
           




              
           

             Yes, the Dollar's dominance of central-bank reserves worldwide has fallen so far this century.
           

              
           

             But 
            the decline has NOT accelerated since Russia invaded Ukraine and Moscow got whacked by sanctions, not according to detailed analysis published by the International Monetary Fund. Nor has it been anywhere near as dramatic as 
            the rush for the exits of the late 1970s-to-early-80s.
           

              
           

             Moreover, other Western currencies have taken up the slack. China's Yuan accounts for less than 1/4 of the Dollar's drop (nobody wants Rubles). On top of that, 
            the strength of the Dollar on the currency market just goes to show that private capital still wants greenbacks over anything else, even if sovereign reserve managers continue trimming the USD's share of their stash.
           

              
           

             That's why the almighty Dollar still accounts for the bulk of all international payments...
           

              
           

             ...almost 3-in-5 by value outside of the 20-nation single currency Eurozone...
           

              
           

             ...plus 
            54% of all foreign trade invoices worldwide, despite the USA accounting for less than half that much as a share of global economic activity, half again as an export destination, and very nearly half again as an exporter itself.
           

              
           

             Even where the Dollar has lost ground, the advancing currencies are very much from 'the West' rather than 'the Rest'. Together with the Big Four (USD, Euros, UK Pounds and Japanese Yen) the growth in Aussie Dollars, Canadian Loonies, South Korean Won, Singaporean Dollar and Nordic currencies means that 'the West' accounts for more than 90% of central-bank reserves all told. And 'the West' very much means US political control.
           

              
           

             ""The SWIFT payment system can be used as 
            a tool in attempts to suppress one of the states in the world,"" spits Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says. And he should know. 
           

              
           

             But reality is, a challenger system, using a single currency for the BRICS to trade with each other, simply ""isn't possible"" right now, Peskov also admits.
           

              
           

             Besides, the Dollar as 'credit' works both ways. Because while the seller gets the money, the buyer has to borrow it. The debtor then has to pay interest on what they owe...
           

              
           

             ...paying interest to the seller in the case of vendor-financing like the USA gets, effectively, from China.
           

              
           

             For America's total national debt today, it's now paying more on interest payments than it's spending on its military. Over 1/5th of that drain goes to paying foreign investors and governments.
           

              
           




              
           

             Smart choice? Any choice at all?
           

              
           

             ""I've made a fortune by using debt. If things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that's a smart thing, not a stupid thing.""
           

              
           

             So said Donald Trump to CBS in 2016, back when he still thought he needed to talk to CBS to win an election and before the Democrats were caught out for 
            hawking Chinese-made goods almost as much as he does.

MASLOW's hierarchy of needs was a groundbreaking concept when it first appeared in 1943, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             American psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that certain basic needs – food, water, shelter – must be met before a person can move on to higher levels of self-worth and fulfillment.
           

              
           




              
           

              
           

             Safety is another important, fundamental human need, one that I believe played a major role in this month's election outcome.
           

              
           

             People want to feel safe, physically as well as financially. They want to feel protected in their homes and communities, and when they don't, they take their outrage to the ballot box.
           

              
           

             I wrote about this a little over a year ago. I believed then that the record numbers of illegal immigrants pouring across the Southern Border would end up hurting President Joe Biden's re-election bid.
           

              
           

             It appears that's precisely what happened, based on the theory of wisdom of crowds. When Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee in August, she failed to convince voters that the problem would be fixed.
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, President-Elect Donald Trump aggressively ran on the issue of illegal immigration and border security, and he turned out the victor.
           

              
           




              
           

             In hindsight, the writing was on the wall all along.
           

              
           

             A Gallup poll conducted back in February found that immigration was Americans' number one concern. Over a quarter of people (28%) cited immigration as the most important problem facing the country, topping other issues like the government (20%), the economy (12%) and even inflation (11%).
           

              
           

             I'm aware of the many studies that show that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than US citizens. But as we all know, politics is perception, and the prevailing perception is that
           

              
           

             American towns and cities have become less safe due to an influx of unvetted, undocumented migrants.
           

              
           

             This perception has grown strong enough to affect people's spending behavior. On my early morning jogs through my neighborhood, I've noticed more and more families putting up fences, indicating a heightened sense of insecurity.
           

              
           

             Voters are likewise telling elected officials they're done playing nice with those who commit crime. Last week, California voters approved a measure that would impose harsher penalties for theft and drug trafficking, reversing ""woke"" criminal justice policies that have the perception of coddling criminals.
           

              
           

             So I'd like to highlight some areas that I think could see a tailwind under a second Trump presidency. First, think small- to mid-cap US stocks, many of which could be in a good position to benefit from lower income taxes and relaxed regulations.
           

              
           

             That's because, as was the case during his first term, Trump is expected to prioritize business-friendly policies that especially favor companies that generate most of their revenue from domestic, rather than international, sales.
           

              
           

             Take a look at Trump's favorability among small business leaders during his first term. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index remained at historically elevated levels, scoring an average monthly reading of 103.4 – even when you factor in the pandemic months.
           

              
           

             The average reading under Biden has been about 10 points lower, indicating that entrepreneurs have lacked confidence in the country's business climate. The NFIB reported last month that uncertainty was at its highest reading ever, due in large part to the upcoming election.
           

              
           

             But what about tariffs? Throughout his campaign, Trump touted the economic benefits of tariffs, claiming they will help ease deficit spending, not to mention protect domestic industries from lower-cost competition abroad.
           

              
           

             Economists warn that tariffs will lead to another spike in inflation, since US import companies are the ones responsible for paying these taxes, not the exporting country, as some people claim. But if you recall, Trump had tariffs on billions of Dollars' worth of goods during his first term, and headline inflation remained anemic.
           

              
           

             Soon after it was clear that Trump won reelection, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high price on hopes that the president-elect will make good on his promise to transform the US into the world's ""Bitcoin superpower."" As I write this, the world's largest digital asset is trading above $82,000.
           

              
           

             Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, perhaps the Senate's most vocal Bitcoin advocate, declared on X that the US would ""BUILD A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE"". According to Lummis's plan, the US will incrementally buy up to 1 million BTC, roughly 5% of total supply.
           

              
           

             At today's prices, that's approximately $82 billion. For comparison's sake, the value of the country's gold reserve was over $540 billion at the end of last year.
           

              
           

             It's believed that if the US ends up establishing a Bitcoin reserve, it might encourage other nations to follow suit in a fit of FOMO (fear of missing out).
           

              
           

             On the investing side, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) is now larger than its gold ETF (IAU). Launched in early 2024, IBIT had over $34 billion in assets as of Thursday, compared to IAU's approximately $33 billion. IBIT launched earlier this year, while IAU launched nearly 20 years ago, in 2005.
           

              
           

             Gold dropped more than 3% the day after the election as the US Dollar surged as much as 1.6%, its biggest one-day jump in about two years. During Trump's first term, the yellow metal gained 55.4%, underperforming the S&P500, which rose 83.8% over the same period.
           

              
           

             I believe the gold industry can be divided into the Fear Trade and the Love Trade. Whereas the former is more associated with auspicious gold-buying in India and China, the latter has to do with buying physical gold in an effort to hedge against inflation, interest rates, bad fiscal policies, general uncertainty and the like.
           

              
           

             Will the Trump 2.0 era ignite the Fear Trade or the Love Trade? Time will tell, but to prepare, I always recommend a 10% weighting in gold, with 5% in physical bullion and the other 5% in gold stocks and ETFs. Remember to rebalance every year."

BIG WEEK, big yawn, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Trump won, stocks jumped, the Fed cut.
           

              
           

             ""Trump is inflationary,"" or so everyone says, pointing at tariffs and deportations and unfunded tax cuts. But the Fed will keep cutting, or so everyone thinks.
           

              
           

             Cue real yields in the bond market to fall. Yet 
            gold prices sank. 
           

              
           

             What gives?
           

              
           

             ""Gold, widely viewed as a hedge against inflation, has traditionally had an 
            inverse relationship with US real yields,"" says 
            
             a tweet
             an X from Hong Kong-based financial research and wealth management firm Gavekal, posted on the eve of the election and 
            repeating a point we've made and come back to time and again in BullionVault's own research.
           

              
           

             They also post a chart we're tired of talking about, too.
           

              
           




              
           

             Why this link?
           

              
           

             Gold pays no interest but cannot be inflated away. Cash and bonds do the opposite. Hence the inverse correlation between gold prices and inflation-protected debt yields.
           

              
           

             ""However,"" says Gavekal...
           

              
           

             ...inverting the right-hand axis on its chart, the better to show the strength of the connexion...
           

              
           

             ...""this relationship seemingly broke down in 2022, coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent freezing of its forex reserves.""
           

              
           

             That also repeats what we've 
            noted time and 
            again in the 
            past 2 years.
           

              
           

             And the timing of this breakdown, says Gavekal, ""implies that one of the major drivers of the ongoing rally in the gold price is the demand for diversification of reserves, where the security of the asset is prioritized over its prospective returns.""
           

              
           

             By reserves, Gavekal means central-bank reserves. And by security, it means the absence of political control by Washington or its allies.
           

              
           

             This isn't news to anyone investing or trading the gold market. Central-bank demand has soared following the US-UK-EU sanctions against Moscow since the Kremlin began its all-out war on Ukraine.
           

              
           

             But has it really? Not on the official data central-bank gold reserves data.
           

              
           

             In fact, the numbers reported by 
            gold-holding central banks worldwide to the International Monetary Fund show growth slowing by over 40% since Russia's tanks rolled into Ukraine compared to the pace pre-invasion.
           

              
           

             So instead, this latest boom has been invisible, showing up in the gap between visible gold demand and visible supply worldwide, and confirmed by intelligence, analysis and estimates from specialist consultancies such as 
            Metals Focus, whose data feed into the mining industry's 
            World Gold Council data.
           

              
           

             Why hide? Central banks tend to be quiet if not secretive (or 
            just outright obtuse), the better to avoid scrutiny by meddling voters or analysts or indeed markets.
           

              
           

             Many Western authorities, for instance, kept their 
            plans to sell gold invisible in the 1990s, only revealing what they'd done after the fact to avoid hurting their own sale-price during that decade's bear market. Today's big gold buyers also want to avoid front-running their own trades. And besides, why should they tell the IMF in Washington or any other post-WW2 organization what they're up to?
           

              
           

             ""The rise of the East and the decline of the West"" is 
            how China's rulers in Beijing see the world today, says Australia's ambassador to the USA (and former Aussie Prime Minister) Kevin Rudd.
           

              
           

             ""We are now living in a period of great historical change the likes of which we have not seen in 100 years.""
           

              
           

             Russia's Vladimir Putin holds the same view, urging his counterparts at the recent BRICS summit of emerging-market nations to 
            pursue a 'new world order' pitting the West against the Rest.
           

              
           

             So why play by the West's decades-old 'rules' of transparency, co-operation and fairness, all imposed at the point of a gun or the sharp end of Dollar-account sanctions? 
           

              
           

             Even where a gold-buying central bank has continued to update the world on its purchases, the appeal of gold stands out as a stateless currency...
           

              
           

             ...an asset which no one can create, destroy or control...
           

              
           

             ...making it very different to the US Dollar, Euro, Pound or Yen.
           

              
           

             So the other big trend since 2022 both for invisible and reported central-bank gold buying has been for sovereign nations to buy in London – heart of the global gold market – and then ship it home.
           

              
           




              
           

             Along with the New York Fed, the Bank of England is where central banks worldwide like to keep gold, ready to sell or lend should they need some cash.
           

              
           

             Very little of those Bank of England gold custody holdings are actually British. But thanks to other central banks using its services, the BoE's gold vault tonnage set a series-record high in late 2021.
           

              
           

             However, the quantity of gold entrusted to the Old Lady's care beneath Threadneedle Street then shrank by 1/8th in just 2 years, and while it has rallied, it still lags the growth in reported central-bank gold reserves worldwide, never mind the best estimates for total holdings including the invisible stuff.
           

              
           

             Take India, for instance.
           

              
           

             The Reserve Bank held 38.9% of its 760-tonne holdings at home in March 2022. That 
            proportion has since risen to 59.7% of today's 854-tonne holdings.
           

              
           

             Why?
           

              
           

             ""Our gold was in a London vault. It is being brought back to an Indian vault. It makes no difference at all,"" 
            claimed former finance minister P.Chidambaram when shipping some of India's gold to Delhi a few years ago.
           

              
           

             But ""we should care about it,"" said one 
            
             Twitter
             X user this Diwali.
           

              
           

             ""We 
            don't want our gold to be blocked by the US in case of a conflict, just like they did to Russia.""
           

              
           

             So to recap, and like Gavekal says, emerging-market gold demand from ""the Rest vs. the West"" looks very likely a key driver of gold's big gains over the past few years.
           

              
           

             But so too does another major event. Because that crack in how gold prices work, splitting from the traditional link with real US bond yields, ""also coincides with the decline in the world's largest asset market,"" notes 
            a separate response on X.com.
           

              
           

             No, not US Treasuries or even the S&P500, but Chinese property...
           

              
           

             ...estimated to have been 
            worth almost $90 trillion in 2022, ahead of the USA's total notional real estate value of $65 trillion.
           

              
           




              
           

             Like China's real estate wealth, its stock market also began sinking in early 2022.
           

              
           

             And with cash interest rates on the floor (aiming to revive share prices and real estate but to no avail), savers and investors in China were 
            left with little choice but to buy gold.
           

              
           

             That's because, unlike you or me, they couldn't go out and buy go-go US tech stocks. Living under a Communist dictatorship means you can't get your money out.
           

              
           

             So gold demand in the No.1 consumer nation leapt as property and equities sank, driving the Shanghai gold price sharply higher and boosting the incentive for new imports to fresh all-time highs in autumn 2023 as people piled into jewellery, coins and small bars, even gold-backed ETF trust fund products. 
           

              
           

             But here again, just as with central banking's invisible gold demand, China's private-sector rush into gold hasn't been completely visible. Quite the reverse, in fact.
           

              
           

             Lots of metal went in – and lots got mined in China too (it's been the No.1 miner nation since 2007) – but reported demand just didn't match up. 
           

              
           

             This gap wasn't new in itself. But the size was. And so too was the solution to this puzzle for analysts and pundits. Because where gold-backed bank accounts used to plug the gap...
           

              
           

             ...with analysis in the mid-2010s counting up all the gold added to commercial bank balance sheets to explain where the 'missing' metal had gone...
           

              
           

             ...
            China's commercial bank gold holdings have instead been falling.
           

              
           

             ""A total of 2,700 tonnes of gold has gone missing in China in the past two years,"" said economist Chen Long back in June (formerly at Gavekal, as it happens, but now running his own consultancy Plenum),  ""more than half of annual global gold production.""
           

              
           

             ""There are several possibilities that could explain where it has gone,"" Chen went on, suggesting everything from central bank reserves to China's sovereign wealth fund or perhaps foreign banks importing gold and then holding onto it without reporting it on their quarterly filings.
           

              
           

             But most likely, and especially amid the surge of private-investor gold demand, Chinese bank customers drove this hidden buying, adding metal which they own outright inside their bank's safe-deposit boxes or vaults, rather than leaving it on the bank's balance sheet.
           

              
           

             Giving it to the bank in exchange for, say, zero storage fees, would be known as 
            'unallocated' gold. It lets you enjoy any price gains as a creditor only, rather than as an actual owner. It would therefore mean that the gold appeared on the bank's balance sheet, because it would belong to the bank. Whereas going 
            allocated (as you do by using BullionVault, only at vastly lower cost versus using a bank) means it doesn't show, because the metal isn't a bank asset (just like your property doesn't show on BullionVault's balance sheet either).
           

              
           

             So again, as with central-banking's unreported purchases, this big move in Chinese gold investment doesn't show up in the visible demand data. And nor does the real kicker of the past few months' surge to high after high after high:
           

              
           

             Indirect demand driven by speculation in futures and options contracts.
           

              
           




              
           

             Today's final chart shows just how much invisible and indirect demand has been driving gold prices higher.
           

              
           

             It uses data from the World Gold Council, who resolve this gap through what their 
            Excel spreadsheets call 'OTC and other'.
           

              
           

             By that, they mean 'over the counter' transactions for wholesale gold and kilobars. Because as with our example of allocated gold investors in China, none of that will show on a bank or a broker's balance sheet if the client owns the metal outright.
           

              
           

             The number also includes ""changes to inventories on commodity exchanges, any unobserved changes in fabrication inventories, and any statistical residual.""
           

              
           

             Why rely on this fudge to balance the sums? Basic economics says that demand must exactly match supply. But even if we accept that thesis, not all of the buying will come from active demand, driven by a free decision to own more gold.
           

              
           

             Instead, a big chunk will come from banks, brokers and dealers needing to hedge their exposure to gold-price bets made by their clients.
           

              
           

             You see, whether or not any metal is involved, the futures and forwards tail really does wag today's spot-price dog. How?
           

              
           

             First, if futures, forwards and options traders bid up the price of gold in 1 month or 3 months or 12 months' time, then the spot price will of course start rising too; and
           

              
           

             Second, the more hot money that pours into those bullish bets on gold, then the more actual gold that somebody, somewhere along the chain, will have to buy to hedge their exposure in case those speculators turn out to be right.
           

              
           

             This indirect demand has become a big part of gold's bull market in 2024. It started with the Chinese gold rush this spring, when that surge in real demand for coins and retail bars was outpaced by a surge in 
            speculative gold trading in Shanghai.
           

              
           

             It then switched, via a brief spell of hedge funds apparently trading options and swaps in the London physical market, to US Comex contracts, where the speculative long position (net of that group's bearish bets) just set 
            a new all-time gold derivatives record by value.
           

              
           

             What's been missing, however, was Western investment demand for coins, small bars, vaulted bullion, metal-backed ETFs or any other product directly involving physical gold. Whereas now, ""Western investors are returning to the gold market,"" according to US investment bank Goldman Sachs, recommending gold 
            as a hedge against potential geopolitical shocks, trade tensions, Federal Reserve rate cuts, and 
            debt concerns.
           

              
           

             ""This 
            needs to continue to shift,"" says John Reade, market strategist at the mining industry's World Gold Council, because while ""the last few years have really been dominated by emerging-market buying of gold – whether by central banks or in jewellery or bar and coin investment – those categories are beginning to slow down a bit.
           

              
           

             ""Western investors added to their exchange-traded gold fund holdings in the third quarter,"" says Reade, ""so that's a positive start. But the physical coin and small investment bar market in the West still remains quiet. We need to see that improve for gold to trade sustainably higher I think.""
           

              
           

             Western demand stayed quiet because...
           

              
           

             ...unlike China's population, and unlike emerging-market central bankers fearing US sanctions...
           

              
           

             ...Western investors haven't been suffering a crisis.
           

              
           

             Cost of living jumped, sure. But so did the stock market, and average wages, and house prices, even interest rates on cash in the bank too. And all while the jobless rate held near multi-decade records at or close to 'full employment'.
           

              
           

             But this looks to be changing. US data for September's job vacancies and October's net hiring were awful. Western central banks have started cutting the returns to cash, just as Western stock markets struggle to regain or beat the late-summer's fresh all-time highs.
           

              
           

             UK and French investors meantime face stark new tax rises, especially for larger savers and wealthier households, plus a fresh drag on jobs growth from higher employer taxation. Germany faces the collapse of its fragile coalition government, and Spain faces fresh turmoil between Madrid and would-be breakaway regions over its slow response to this autumn's terrible and devastating floods.
           

              
           

             Cue a big jump in new gold investing among UK, French and Spanish investors. Italy too. Hell, even Germany is seeing new investors start buying bullion 
            after Europe's gold-market darling fell off a cliff when the Eurozone central bank finally moved to raise interest rates from below zero right around the time Russia invaded Ukraine and gold snapped its set-your-watch correlation with real interest rates.
           

              
           

             So far, however, US investors themselves continue to sit out buying gold. Maybe that's because the Democrat candidate just lost (and was always going to lose). Maybe it's because the stock market continues to soar.
           

              
           

             Either way, you can 
            read the full story in our latest Gold Investor Index data and comment.
           

              
           

             As you'll see, Western gold investing demand...
           

              
           

             ...and its impact on precious metals prices...
           

              
           

             ...could be about to become very visible and very direct as Donald Trump returns to the White House.
           

              
           

             But that link between real rates and gold prices? It's still broken, so far, since this week's election outcome."
2024-11-05,"Title:Election 2024: New Gold Buying Doubles, But Not in USA
Article:US investors skip global surge in new gold investment…


              
           


GOLD's ongoing run of new record prices has seen the number of first-time precious metals investors double ahead of the US election, 
            reports Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault, now caring for $5.2 billion of precious metal (£4.0bn, €4.8bn, ¥794bn) for over 100,000 users from 175 countries.


              
           

             New buying in the USA was softer, however, slipping last month from September's figure.
           

              
           

             So if the US election is having any impact on safe-haven demand for bullion, it's spooking private investors in Europe far more than American voters right now.
           

              
           

             It's hard to imagine that gold has lost its protective appeal among US investors. America's relatively soft demand for precious metals perhaps signals the depths of political polarisation. Voters are so divided, they don't know and rarely meet anyone with opposing views, so they believe a big win is coming for their chosen candidate.
           

              
           

Do only Republicans invest in gold and silver, and only when there's a Democrat in the White House?


              
           

             Gold in US Dollar terms finished October with its 4th new month-end record in a row, rising 4.0% to $2734 and setting the 38th 
            fresh daily gold-price high of 2024 so far at $2790 on Halloween. That count matches the full-year total across 2011 at the most since 1979's record of 54.
           

              
           

             In both UK Pounds and Euro terms gold meantime set 14 new record days in October – the most ever in one calendar month – rising 8.0% to £2122 and up 6.9% to €2517 respectively.
           

              
           

             Worldwide, the number of new investors in precious metals doubled from its prior 12-month average (+104.2%), jumping 49.9% from September's figure to mark the most first-time users of BullionVault since March 2022 – the 
            Russian invasion of Ukraine – on a surge in the UK, France, Germany and Italy.
           

              
           

             UK first-time investors rose 41.6% from September and 116.2% from the prior 12-month average amid concerns over Rachel Reeves' first Labour Budget, reaching the most since May 2021. But despite the impending White House election, and while the number of first-time investors in the USA held 54.8% above its prior 12-month average, it dropped 17.2% from September's figure and was 36.8% below May's 13-month high.
           

              
           

             In France, the number of first-time bullion buyers rose 123.5% month-on-month to stand 124.6% above its 12-month average at the most since August 2020, while the number of first-time bullion buyers in Germany rose 100.4% and 95.6% on those metrics, reaching the most since April 2022. Italy rose 168.4% month-on-month to stand 148.8% above the 12-month average at the most since March 2022, and the number of first-time bullion buyers in Spain rose 58.6% month-on-month to stand 112.3% above the 12-month average at the most since February 2021.
           

              
           

             But while the number of first-time investors in the USA held 54.8% above its prior 12-month average, it dropped 17.2% from September's figure and was 36.8% below May's 13-month high.
           

              
           




              
           

             Last month, the number of people starting or adding to their personal gold holdings using BullionVault rose to the most since June 2023, up 37.5% from September, while the number of investors choosing to sell rose 9.3% to the most since April. 
           

              
           

             Together, that took the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of physical bullion sentiment across the past 15 years among the world's largest pool of private investors in precious metals – 1.6 points higher from September's 5-month low to 53.6, the highest reading since June.
           

              
           

             The 
            Gold Investor Index set a decade-high of 65.9 as the Covid Crisis hit in March 2020, and it fell to an all-time low of 47.5 this March as gold began its current price surge, signalling more sellers than buyers with only its 3rd reading below 50.0 of the past 15 years.
           

              
           

             Gold's record-breaking bull market has clearly pulled in speculative traders betting that these price gains will continue. But it would be wrong in physical bullion to attribute this jump in new buyers solely to fear-of-missing-out.
           

              
           

             Uncertainty, volatility and geopolitical risks are rising, and not just because of the US election. Gold has repeatedly helped offset losses in other asset classes, and that appeal is starting to overcome the sticker shock of gold's latest all-time highs. For new investors, the price you missed doesn't matter. What counts for today's buyers is what gold's track record says it could do when the next crisis strikes.
           

              
           

             By weight, gold investors were net sellers yet again as a group overall in October, with BullionVault client holdings – all vaulted and insured in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich – shrinking 0.6% to a 51-month low beneath 44.2 tonnes.
           

              
           

             That marked the 14th consecutive month of investor profit-taking overall. But the net quantity of 271 kilograms sold was smaller by almost a quarter (23.2%) from September's 6-month record. October also marked the 4th month in a row that BullionVault clients' gold holdings grew to a fresh month-end record, rising 3.3% to $3.8 billion (+7.4% in GBP to £3.0bn, +6.2% in EUR to more than €3.5bn).
           

              
           

             While client gold holdings have now fallen 8.4% by weight since August 2023's all-time record above 48.2 tonnes, the value has risen 29.0% in US Dollar terms (+26.9% in British Pounds, +28.8% in Euro terms).
           

              
           




              
           

             Private investors in Western Europe and North America – where BullionVault finds 9-in-10 of its users worldwide – were also net sellers of silver by weight in October, liquidating 16.4 tonnes of the more industrially-useful precious metal.
           

              
           

             That 1.4% drop more than erased the summer's rebound in BullionVault clients' silver holdings, cutting them to the lowest in 45 months at 1,146 tonnes. But while investor silver holdings have now shrunk 9.5% from October 2022's record high above 1,267 tonnes, the value has risen 58.9% to a record $1.2bn (+41.2% in UK Pounds to a record £954 million, +45.1% in Euros to a record €1.1bn).
           

              
           

             The number of silver buyers meantime leapt by 66.4% from September's 6-month low, while the number of sellers continued to rise but less quickly, adding 17.6% to hit the most since May.
           

              
           

             Together that pulled the Silver Investor Index up 2.1 points from September's 4-month low to read 51.0, marking only the 6th month of more buyers than sellers so far this year.
           

              
           

             Silver prices rose 8.1% across October for US Dollar investors, peaking at $34.86 mid-month and setting its highest month-end since November 2012. Silver priced in GBP rose 11.7% – the 3rd double-digit gain of 2024 so far for UK investors – peaking at £26.85 and setting the highest month-end since April 2011, while Euro silver prices rose 10.1%, peaking at €32.28 per Troy ounce and setting the highest month-end since April 2011's all-time record.
           

              
           

             2024's runaway rise in precious metals prices, in other words, means that profit-taking continues to dominate silver action. Gold, in contrast, is finding strong new demand as the US election arrives. Just not in the USA itself. Not yet."
2024-11-04,"Title:Chinese Curse? Fake News!
Article:But 'interesting' politics hits investment yet again...

 ONE suddenly feels terribly old, says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 A few weekends ago we met with a handful of friends from the City to discuss life, the universe and everything – but mostly matters financial.
 During the course of our discussions, we discovered that what we understood to be an ancient Chinese curse – ""May you live in interesting times"" – turns out to be no such thing.
 The idea of the curse is ""fake news"". As Wikipedia points out, it seems more likely that the quote was actually a comparatively recent accidental coinage from one or other British politician.
 The people in attendance at this little symposium came from a variety of disciplines. Most were current or former traders, including my brother, who used to head up Italian bond trading for a major Italian bank. Several were trend-following traders. One worked for a data analysis and expert witness company. One was a 31-year-old German post-graduate specialising in artificial intelligence.
 The plight of the (comparatively) young German was the one that gave us most food for thought.
 Despite being absurdly well-educated and fluent in several languages, including English and Portuguese, our young PhD friend was a) having difficulty securing any kind of paid employment and b) finding that real world social interaction with young British females was, let's call it, ""problematic"" on account of what he implied was an extremely high level of ""fussiness"".
 We can't realistically comment on the latter complaint, but he seemed perfectly charming to us. But we can certainly relate to the former. Perhaps the angriest this correspondent has ever been was as a graduate looking for work in the middle of 1991. We had just obtained a decent degree from a decent university having been a decent student throughout our scholastic career.
 We had spent every college vacation in either paid employment or in unpaid internships to gain work experience. We had applied to over 30 firms across a wide variety of disciplines. Yet job offers came there none. Such was the situation in the recession year of 1991. Since we couldn't find work in our preferred areas (journalism; advertising), on the back of some well-meant fraternal advice we widened our search to include banks, and the rest is history.
 From that time, frustratedly awaiting some offer – any offer – of employment, we recall practically a stand-up fight with our father. This correspondent's perspective: ""I have done everything in my power and worked damned hard for years to be gainfully employed."" The paternal perspective: ""The world doesn't owe you a living.""
 We could certainly relate to the situation of this German gentleman.
 There are simply lucky generations and unlucky ones. Our parents' generation was not necessarily so lucky – they were born just before World War II, and their earliest years were a mixture of ordeal and deprivation. But the post-war years, on the other hand, saw happier days.
 The generations before them: not so lucky. Especially those who actually participated in the World Wars, and did not necessarily survive them.
 This correspondent's generation: pretty lucky, all in all. Although finding a permanent job after university wasn't as easy as we'd expected, after a few years of hard graft and saving, we were able to put down a deposit on, and buy, a property – in central London to boot.
 Generation ""Today"": not so lucky. As our German friend is finding, jobs are not that easy to come by. And even if you are able to secure one, it's unlikely that you'll be able to afford to take even the most basic steps towards securing a property anywhere remotely close to the south-east of England, let alone London. And there are very strange things happening to people's brains, and ""courtship"", let's say, as a result of technological change and ubiquitous access to smartphones.
 We discussed a wide variety of topics that weekend, including those alluded to above, but also not limited to:

 Global debt and financial markets – is the current financial system sustainable given the monstrous amount of debt flooding the world?
 AI and machine learning – where will the jobs go?
 The dilemma for young people – are we living through the ""last days of empire""?
 Is technology fuelling mental health problems and addictions – to pornography and much else besides – among the young?
 Has the ""capitalism"" versus ""socialism"" debate been conclusively answered – just not in a way that any of us anticipated?
 Opportunities for the future.

But that five-years-old 'Sunday Times' article highlighted above gets to the heart of the problem. There are pressing problems facing all of us as investors. Forget the day-to-day vagaries of the financial markets, which are ultimately timeless and inevitable – how do we protect what we already have?
 Speaking of history repeating itself, we heard an anecdote from those far distant days of 2019 worthy of repetition. Since this was hearsay, we cannot attest to its reliability.
 The story goes that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell in 2019 met with the senior partners of a major accountancy firm and asked the following questions:

 If and when Labour is elected, on Day One can we raise income tax?
 If and when Labour is elected, on Day One can we raise the top rate of income tax to 70%?
 If and when Labour is elected, on Day One can we raise the threshold for inheritance tax?
 If and when Labour is elected, on Day One can we introduce a one-off ""wealth tax"" on assets over, say, £1 million?

We stress that this was hearsay. But the expression 'different circus; same clowns' springs to mind. Note, too, The Daily Telegraph's headline of 7th October 2024, 'Britain to suffer biggest exodus of millionaires in the world'.
 The fundamental problem with socialism is that it never manages to grasp that basic economics and natural human self-interest and ambition will never be trumped by a naïve ideology in 'equality'. As we pointed out recently, not everyone possesses the entrepreneurial gene, least of all governments. Entrepreneurs, not politicians, are the true wealth creators. And entrepreneurial capital, like any other form of capital, will go where it is most respected. Treat it with contempt, or take it for granted, and national impoverishment will surely follow.
 Irrespective of the absolute level of our wealth, how can we try to protect ourselves from what would now be a Starmer-Reeves wealth raid?
 One caveat: there is only so far one can go in anticipating and mitigating the predations of a malignly wealth-destroying government. There are some basic steps, but for the sceptically inclined, you simply cannot go too far. Or as Lily Tomlin once said,
 ""No matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep up.""
 One obvious way to protect one's assets is to wrap them within some kind of legal and/or tax-advantaged structure, such as a trust, an offshore trust, an ISA or SIPP (Self Invested Personal Pension). The most vulnerable assets, we suspect, will be cash sitting inertly in bank accounts.
 But moving your assets offshore won't necessarily be sufficient.
 If you own Sterling denominated assets – here in the UK or in a Swiss or Singaporean bank, for example – those assets will still ultimately ""clear"" through the London banking system. Which will be vulnerable to any diktats issued by a UK government.
 So if you want to attempt a ""belt and braces"" approach to your assets, not only will you need to consider where those assets are custodied, but what the currency composition of those assets is. Own Sterling assets, and you will be that much more at risk to the predations of a Labour wealth grab.
 We are not necessarily recommending switching your portfolio to other currencies (though a degree of currency diversification, especially including gold, always makes sense), merely highlighting a technical vulnerability of sterling denominated ""stuff"".
 Other ""tactics""? As the former MoneyWeek editor Merryn Somerset Webb rightly observed at the time of the first Labour tax scare, you may wish to consider selling
 ""...any property that isn't your primary home – second homes, and buy-to-lets in particular, are the most obvious of wealth tax targets. Perhaps fix your mortgage on your main home while you are at it: unfunded spending promises will hit the pound, create inflation and push interest rates up. If you are a high earner (on £70,000-£80,000-plus a year) and have the capacity to bring income forward in order to avoid fast-rising additional rates of income tax (there is talk of 70%), now might be time to do that. Also make sure that you are using up all your allowances: capital gains is bound to rise under a Labour government, for example.
 ""I'd also top up pensions and individual savings accounts (Isas), with the caveat that a Corbyn [now Starmer] government could easily force redirection of the assets within pensions in particular. Can you imagine a scenario in which a fiscally bombed out government puts in place regulations requiring all pension assets over, say, £500,000-a-head, to be invested in, say, perpetual 'national regeneration bonds'?""
 Which brings us to the second phase of the pre-emptive measures that could plausibly make sense, namely wealth preservation.
 Longstanding readers will likely be familiar with the ""wealth preservation"" aspect of this debate, because it is the bedrock of our discretionary portfolio approach.
 Structure first. Composition second.
 One remark we made at that recent investment 'symposium' is a favourite old chestnut of ours: If you don't understand the rules of the game, perhaps it's better not to play. This describes our attitude toward the bond market, where we utterly fail to see how today's still insultingly low yields can possibly compensate bond investors for the credit, duration, inflation and interest rate risk they are now exposed to.
 So that leaves a combination of absolute return investments, ""value"" oriented equities, and real assets – adjust according to personal taste, appetite for risk, requirement for income, and time horizon.
 Better to be remotely right than 100% wrong. There are no precise answers or percentage allocations to these various asset classes, because investing is by definition an inexact, imprecise science. But if we are convinced of anything in these dangerous times, it is that true diversification makes more sense than ever.
 Rob Gardner is a pensions specialist and also a fierce advocate of financial education for the young. One of the games that Rob teaches is a variation on Jenga – where you take blocks, one at a time, from a little tower, and add them to the top.
 Rob's version, 'Built to Last', is effectively the opposite, and also a great way of teaching the merits of diversification in a way that even young children can relate to:
 ""The aim was to grow £50 as much as possible by building towers that had to reach a certain height to accumulate compound interest;
 60 cm = 25% 80 cm = 50% 100 cm = 200% 120 cm = 500%
 ""You were given 3 attempts, each lasting 2 and a half minutes.
 ""The rules of the game were stacked to favour particular strategies. Specifically ones which, if applied to your real world savings, happen to help you grow your long term wealth.""
 So what were the lessons that meant you could excel and climb the leader board?

 The sooner you start, the more your savings can begin to compound. Don't spend too long thinking; Start building and keep banking! And come back!
 Properly spreading your risks is a good idea in the long run. Accept you will suffer occasional losses;
 Build more than one tower. Don't just build 60cm every time – occasionally going for higher risk reaps huge rewards;
 You may well make mistakes and lose money. Right sizing your risks will keep you in the game;
 Regardless of the rewards, don't even try making it to 120cm! You need a strategy that carries the appropriate amount of risk that allows you to reach your goal. A combination of 60cm, 80cm and 100cm will take you to the top;
 A strategy is only successful if it meets your objectives. How others perform is irrelevant. Easier said than done, but you're not actually competing against the person across the table.

""Those who combined a number of these strategies were always the most successful. 'Built to Last' showed the power of Gamification as an educational tool..
 ""And it is just one of the tools at our disposal in the fight for a more secure financial future.""
 These may or may not be interesting times. The curse may be imaginary, but the threat to investors and their capital is real. Having a plan, together with a genuinely diversified portfolio focused primarily on defensive value, will surely help, whatever governments and the vicissitudes of the markets throw at us."
2024-10-31,"Title:Trump's Great Statesman Tariffs
Article:Trade barriers made America great...

 The ELECTION is a tight race, although it appears to be breaking for Trump, says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 The Democratic strategy is essentially to call Trump Hitler and a would-be dictator who would jail his political opponents (sound familiar?) and destroy democracy.
 Though they focus much more on Trump the man than his actual policies, it's important to understand Trump's position on tariffs, for example, because it would impact millions of Americans.
 Donald Trump recently did an interview with John Micklethwait, Bloomberg's top editor and a former editor of The Economist.
 Micklethwait made the tired point that Trump's tariffs would raise prices and be bad for Americans.
 Most of us have been taught that free trade is good and that tariffs are bad. And on the surface it certainly seems true. The theory of free trade based on comparative advantage was advocated by British economist David Ricardo in the early 19th century.
 Ricardo's theory said that trading nations are endowed with attributes that give them a relative advantage in producing certain goods versus others.
 These attributes could consist of natural resources, climate, population, river systems, education, ports, financial capacity or any other factor of production. Nations should produce those goods as to which they have a natural advantage and trade with other nations for goods where the advantage was not so great.
 Countries should specialize in what they do best, and let others also specialize in what they do best. Then countries could simply trade the goods they make for the goods made by others.
 All sides would be better off because prices would be lower as a result of specialization in those goods where you have a natural advantage.
 It's a nice theory often summed up in the idea that Tom Brady shouldn't mow his own lawn because it makes more sense to pay a landscaper while he practices football.
 For example, if the UK had an advantage in textile production and Portugal had an advantage in wine production, then the UK and Portugal should trade wool for wine.
 But if the theory of comparative advantage were true, Japan would still be exporting tuna fish instead of cars, computers, TVs, steel and much more.
 The same can be said of the globalists' view that capital should flow freely across borders. That might be advantageous in theory but market manipulation by central banks and rogue actors like Goldman Sachs and big hedge funds make it a treacherous proposition.
 The problem with this theory of comparative advantage is that the factors of production are not permanent and they are not immobile.
 If labor moves from the countryside to the city in China, then suddenly China has a comparative advantage in cheap labor. If finance capital moves from New York banks to direct foreign investment in Chinese factories, then China has the comparative advantage in capital also.
 Trump understands this, Micklethwait doesn't. Trump didn't just make polite conversation in the interview. He called out Micklethwait by saying, ""It must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative and then have somebody explain to you that you're totally wrong."" Ouch!
 Micklethwait certainly isn't alone. Listening to hysterical commentary from the mainstream media about Trump's tariffs, one would think his policies were in violation of the US Constitution.
 Nothing could be further from the truth. By advocating tariffs, Trump actually wants to return to what made America great in the first place. In fact, tariffs are as American as apple pie.
 From 1790-1962, the United States pursued high tariff policies under a program known as the American System.
 It was created by George Washington's secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, who drafted a report to Congress called the Report on Manufactures presented in 1791. Hamilton proposed that in order to have a strong country, America needed a strong manufacturing base with jobs that taught skills and offered income security.
 To achieve this, Hamilton proposed subsidies to US businesses so they could compete successfully against more established UK and European businesses.
 These subsidies might include grants of government land or rights of way, purchase orders from the government itself or outright payments. This was a mercantilist system that encouraged a trade surplus and the accumulation of gold reserves.
 Hamilton's plan was later proposed on a broader scale by Kentucky Sen. Henry Clay. This new plan began with the Tariff of 1816. Later on, Abraham Lincoln adopted the American System as his platform in the election of 1860, and it became a bedrock principle of the new Republican Party.
 It was affirmed by William McKinley at the end of the 19th century and by Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. The 19th and early 20th centuries were a heyday of the American System. This period was characterized by enormous economic growth and population expansion by the US
 The American System was also accompanied mostly by low inflation or even deflation (which increases the purchasing power of everyday citizens) despite occasional financial panics and some inflation during the Civil War.
 The key takeaway is that America grew rich and powerful from 1787-1962, a period of 175 years, using tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to trade to nurture domestic industry and protect high-paying manufacturing jobs.
 But under the neo-liberal, globalist international order that prevailed in the decades after World War II, free trade doctrine supplanted the American System.
 Globalism requires free trade, open borders and free capital flows or as close as you can come. In theory, this allows for price discovery, lower costs and higher returns to capital.
 In reality, it causes lost jobs, lost competitiveness and lower wages, especially for Americans. US industry was stripped bare and US jobs were lost by the millions, with China being the main beneficiary.
 Globalists embrace what they call ""encasement."" The idea is that national governments don't matter. What does matter is that all global powers – democratic, communist, socialist, kleptocratic – play by the same supranational rules that encase the system of sovereigns.
 Free trade is part of that system (in reality, it's not free trade but managed trade).
 Trump is rejecting the globalist playbook. He's pursuing the same basic policies that predominated in the US from George Washington through Dwight Eisenhower.
 He simply wants to return to the American System that once made America great."
2024-10-30,"Title:'Unreported' Gold Buying Drives Record Prices as Central Bank Demand Halves
Article:OTC gold investment offsets drop in China jewelry, Germany bar and coin...


              
           


UNREPORTED gold buying has again saved the global gold market from a heavy surplus of supply over demand according to new data today, driving prices to fresh record highs even as central banks slow their purchases as a group.
           

              
           

             Figures released by the mining industry's World Gold Council say that across the past 12 months, visible gold demand – net of scrap supply and recycling flows – matched only 68.5% of new mine output.
           

              
           

             The gap between demand and supply was again closed by 
            undisclosed central-bank gold buying on the WGC estimates, plus 'over-the-counter' and other unreported demand among private-sector investors.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Global gold ETF inflows were a major driver of growth"" between July and September says the new 
            Gold Demand Trends data and analysis from the WGC, with investment through those highly visible stock-market traded products flipping positive for the first time since Q1 2022.
           

              
           

             But running much larger than ETFs or central-bank demand, 'OTC and other' unreported purchases ""almost doubled"" in the third quarter of 2024 from the same period last year says the Council's new report, pointing to wholesale and kilo-bar transactions struck with large bullion banks, dealers and brokers rather than via exchange-traded contracts or retail purchases of smaller, higher-cost bars or coin.
           

              
           

             That marked ""the seventh consecutive quarter in which OTC investment has been positive"" – a number which ""captures demand in the OTC market (for which data is not readily available),"" according to the WGC's own definition, plus ""changes to inventories on commodity exchanges, any unobserved changes in fabrication inventories, and any statistical residual.
           

              
           

             ""It is the difference between total supply and gold demand,"" concludes 
            the World Gold Council's note – and supply from gold mining is seeing ""a big push from producers for a record year"" as the market 
            price of gold bullion runs to new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Household and industrial demand, in contrast, has fallen so far in 2024, plunging in No.1 consumer 
            China as jewelry demand falls 27.5% year-to-date and offsetting a rise in No.2 India with weakness in other countries – such as 
            Germany, where retail bar and coin demand continues to collapse.
           

              
           

             All told, that has led to an overall drop of 11.1% in fabricated product demand by weight in the first 9 months of 2024 on today's WGC figures, compiled from fieldwork, analysis and intelligence gathered by specialist analysts Metals Focus.
           

              
           

             Central banks as a group meanwhile halved their net demand in July-to-September on Metals Focus' estimates for the WGC compared to Q3 last year, dropping to the lowest quarterly buying since spring 2023. But while 
            official gold holdings data from the International Monetary Fund aren't yet available for July-to-September, the WGC numbers outstripped those reported figures by 110% over the prior 5-year period.
           

              
           

             Over that same half-decade, 'OTC and other' has now accounted for 1 ounce in every 5 of private-sector net gold demand on the WGC's Gold Demand Trends data, twice the proportion of the previous 20 calendar quarters.
           

              
           


              In Q3 this year ""The value of demand jumped 35% year-on-year to exceed US$100bn for the first time ever,"" says the World Gold Council, judging total purchases to equal exactly the sum of mining output with scrap supply.
            

               
            

              But visible net demand also set a new quarterly record on BullionVault's analysis of the WGC figures, rising 41.6% from the third quarter of 2023 to reach above $62 billion.
            

               
            


               ""The over-the-counter market has been increasingly influenced by demand from high-net-worth investors,"" says 
              Gold Demand Trends Q3 2024, with those players both seeming ""to suffer a case of FOMO as gold's performance repeatedly hit the headlines [while] seeking to hedge geopolitical risk and economic risks.
             

                
             

               ""Positioning of speculative investors in the US futures market can [also] be used as a proxy for identifying trends"" in this unreported and undisclosed segment of gold demand, says the WGC – and 
              the net spec long in Comex gold derivatives leapt to a new record Dollar value in September."
2024-10-30,"Title:Election 2024: All Roads Lead to Inflation
Article:So buy gold and silver, right...?

 WITH ONLY one week remaining before the US presidential election, there's a growing sense of uncertainty in the air, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Investors are wondering how to position their money, bracing for the possibility of significant volatility and market shifts.
 While some hedge funds are making bold moves on so-called ""Trump trades"", we at US Global Investors see things differently.
 In fact, I share billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones' recent outlook on gold and Bitcoin (which validates what I have been writing about for many years). Like him, we currently favor alternative assets as the smart play going forward.
 It's not that we're betting against stocks or the economy, which we believe will do well over time no matter who wins the White House next month. Nevertheless, the writing is clearly on the wall:
 Ballooning US debt and geopolitical tensions all point to the need for a strong hedge.
 You won't be surprised to read that the US debt situation has spiraled out of control. Just 25 years ago, the national debt was a little under 60% of GDP. Today, that rate has doubled to 120%.
 According to Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., this puts the US in a precarious position – ne that's unsustainable in the long run unless serious action is taken to rein in government spending.
 We all know that politicians have a knack for promising more spending (in the Democrats' case) or tax cuts (in the Republicans' case) to keep voters happy. It's easy to see why Jones is concerned that either approach will only exacerbate the debt problem. As he pointed out, the US is ""going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues.""
 That's not just a dramatic soundbite – it's a reality check. The federal deficit for 2024 soared above $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the debt burden, which is rapidly nearing $36 trillion, shows no signs of easing.
  US federal deficit of tax revenue to government spending
 When the government keeps printing money to finance its spending, the inevitable result is inflation. And in times of inflation, the purchasing power of traditional assets like bonds erodes.
 That's why Jones favors assets that perform well in inflationary environments such as gold, silver, commodities and Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment.
 Think about it: Why would you want to own fixed-income assets when interest rates are being adjusted and are likely to be lower than the inflation rate? Long-dated bonds are particularly vulnerable.
 US banks, remember, are still dealing with billions of Dollars in unrealized losses on their fixed-income positions. According to Florida Atlantic University's bank screener, Bank of America's unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investments in the first quarter were a staggering $110 billion, more than any other US institution by far.
 The Fed will likely try to ""inflate"" its way out of this mess, meaning it will keep nominal interest rates lower than inflation to support economic growth. For investors, this means that preserving wealth will require smart positioning in alternative assets.
 Jones is already betting against the bond market – ""I am clearly not going to own any fixed-income,"" he told CNBC last week – and I believe many investors would be wise to take a similar approach.
 Let's start with gold and silver. Both have been go-to haven assets for centuries, and for good reason. When geopolitical tensions have risen, when inflation has reared its ugly head and/or when there's been uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold and silver.
 This year is no exception. We've seen gold shatter records multiple times in 2024, with prices rising more than 32% year-to-date, the metal's best annual growth since 1979.
 According to data from the World Gold Council, gold has consistently outperformed both inflation and the growth rate of the world economy. From 1971 to 2023, gold's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8%, compared to 4% for the US consumer price index (CPI) and 7.8% for global GDP growth.
 
 Silver, often dubbed the ""poor man's gold,"" is another asset that deserves attention. With its industrial applications, especially in the green energy sector, silver has strong potential for future growth. According to one projection, the clean energy transition could dramatically increase the demand for silver in photovoltaic (PV) technology, potentially consuming between 85% and a jaw-dropping 98% of current global silver reserves by 2050.
 Now, let's talk about Bitcoin. The world's largest digital asset has quickly become a preferred store of value for many investors, especially those looking to hedge against fiat currency depreciation. Nearly half of all traditional hedge funds currently maintain exposure to cryptos, including Bitcoin.
 Institutions are also backing Bitcoin with the same enthusiasm. Just look at BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. It's one of the fastest-growing ETFs in financial history, with assets under management now over $26 billion. That's no small feat.
 Bitcoin's decentralized nature, capped supply and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive asset in times of uncertainty. Like gold, it's a hedge against inflation, but it also offers the potential for significant upside as more investors and institutions recognize its value.
 Now, I know you may be wondering: ""What about the election? What if Trump wins? What if Harris wins?""
 Here's a news flash for you: Over the long run, it may not matter as much as you think. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, made a great point recently when he said that he's ""tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime. The reality is over time, it doesn't matter.""
 While hedge funds are taking positions in ""Trump trades"" like private prisons and fossil fuels, we believe that trying to time the market based on election outcomes is a risky game. Yes, the election will cause short-term volatility, but if you're in the right assets – like gold, silver and Bitcoin – I believe you'll be well-positioned to weather the storm."
2024-10-26,"Title:Gold: It's a Bull Market, You Know
Article:Gold price nears $3000 in long-term bull...

 The GOLD PRICE is on a big leg up toward our next target of $3000+, but there is more to the story than that, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Just to be clear that the source writing to you now (your friendly blogger and letter writer) is not among the come-lately momo ""me too!"" crowd. Here is a historical fact:

 I found this on X, as for some reason someone just 'liked' it yesterday and it showed up in my notifications.
 So it's an opportunity to highlight a 3+ year old call that will be right if gold tacks on another mere 12% from today to ""3000+"".
 As to the considerations I noted at the time (2021):
 

 The handle actually got sloppy and morphed into a bullish pattern, which we targeted to 2450, long-since in the books.
 The handle hit the low 1600s as its lows, during the post-Cup grind.
 The answer was years, but now we are within months, if not weeks.

Here is a visual as of market close on October 24. It's as if the gold price is on a mission, isn't it? Load target and acquire target…
 
 After target acquisition (assuming the plan remains on track) there are potential negatives out ahead. But we are changing the long-term macro and that means a new age for gold over the bubble beneficiaries of the last 20 years.
 Gold miners, all things being equal (like governments not commandeering mines, for example), will leverage gold's standing in the macro.
 Once again, a stark picture of one indication that the long-term macro has changed…
 
 One new macro rule? The disinflationary trends in bonds that supported the inflationary bubble making machinery for several decades have been ruptured. Ah, but that discussion is beyond the scope of this article. I have put it out there multitudes of times. Do a search of nftrh.com, and you'll have it.
 The ""gold price"" actually means little to me other than the value of my insurance is rising. As a speculator, gold's relationships in the financial macro provide indications for gold mining stocks. That is where the action is.
 As you can see, gold is trending up vs. cyclical and risk-on items for most of 2024. The exception being silver, which is not a problem to the gold stock investment case because silver will usually lead the precious metals complex during bull phases (ironically, it's when the Gold/Silver ratio finds a low and turns up impulsively that the gold stock play could be indicated to be in trouble).
 We should also consider how the miners are performing with the above indicators theoretically positive for the macro fundamental case. The HUI Gold Bugs index is doing just fine in relation to gold since March. That is an intact positive internal sector indication.
  Chart of the gold-mining stock HUI index vs. the gold price and also the HUI-to-S&P500 ratio
 Gold stocks are also on message while out-performing the vaunted US stock market bull over that same time period.
 As gold eyeballs 3000+, this week's correction in the gold stock sector is not indicated to be anything to worry about. Personally, I hedged it (per the NFTRH Trade Log), have covered half of that short (contemplating the remainder), and am not only surviving the dreaded <sarcasm alert> pullback, but am in the green.
 It doesn't always work that well when hedging, but on this occasion it is. Now it is time to start planning for the next bull leg. We have our post-pullback upside targeting in place, and shorter and longer-term objectives.
 On the biggest picture, however, for gold and the miners that will one day leverage its standing in the new macro, ""It's a bull market, you know"", as Edwin Lefèvre's Old Turkey would say."

Article:US bullion coin sales jump under a Democrat President...


              
           


IT'S A FACT that demand for gold and silver coins in the USA rises under Democrat Presidents.
           

              
           

            That's why many 
            precious-metals adverts and promotions target conservative messages. Republican voters often seek to protect their wealth and savings against liberal and left-leaning Presidents.
           

              
           

            Going into Election 2024 however, 
            Democratic states now lead gold searches online. This suggests that inflation fears and wider economic worries are crossing party lines.
           

              
           

Bottom line? Different gold products see different investment behaviors responding to US elections and politics.

 DO AMERICANS only invest in gold or silver if they vote Republican?
You might think so from the politics of TV and online ads for gold IRA investment accounts. And you'd be right according to data on US gold and silver coin sales.


               The United States Mint sells far more new gold and silver Eagle coins when there's a Democrat President. Well over twice as many, in fact, on BullionVault's analysis of monthly figures since 2001. Demand in real value terms was 289% greater than when Republicans held power.
             

                
             

               But despite what coin promoters and liberal media think, this seemingly political pattern – also seen in demand for 'retail' bars of gold and silver, but not in vaulted bullion or metal-backed ETF investment trusts –  may have other explanations. It might also be changing. Because while right-wing voices warn against Kamala Harris' radical-left tax and spending plans, research by 
              BullionVault also finds that, ahead of this November's election, more people in Democratic states are searching for gold-related terms on Google than people in Republican strongholds.
             

                
             

               Eight of today's top 10 states for 'gold price' searches voted for Biden in 2020. All but one of those – Nevada, now a key battleground – looks set to vote for the Democrats again this November.
             

                
             

               Why might the apparently partisan politics of gold and silver demand in the USA be changing?

               Sales of new US precious metals coins have in fact fallen across the past 6 months to the lowest by weight since before Covid pandemic lockdowns began, back in the final year of Republican Donald Trump's 2017-2021 term.
             

                
             

               This might suggest Republican voters don't expect or fear Kamala Harris beating the former President this fall, because it contrasts with the clear political pattern of the past 6 presidential terms:
             

                
             
 America Buys More Gold and Silver Coins When the President is a Democrat

               The split since 2001, under two red and two blue leaders, has been stark. So too is the partisan bias in today's precious-metal marketing and investment news:
             

                
             

 Donald Trump launched a range of gold and silver coins ahead of the 2024 presidential election;
 Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham urges putting gold coins into your IRA account to protect your savings against Kamala Harris becoming President;
 Liberal media meanwhile report US coin dealers targeting ""conservative activists"" with gold and silver promotions at gun shows.


               The apparent politics of US bullion coin demand is an open secret in the precious metals industry.
             

                
             

               ""There's massive interest in this market that responds to right-wing messages,"" says one gold and silver coin dealer. And those messages appear to play best under Democrat administrations.
             
 



 



                
             

               As this chart shows, demand for new US Mint gold and silver coins shows such a strong split along political lines that you might think retail bullion dealers would now be funding a Harris super PAC to win Election 2024.
             

                
             

 US Gold and Silver Coin Sales Under Recent Presidents: Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden

                During Barack Obama's two terms as Democratic President, data from the US Mint show that sales of newly-minted American gold Eagle and Buffalo coins rose 127% by weight compared to Republican predecessor George W.Bush's eight years in office.
              

                 
              

                In real terms, those sales leapt 370% by inflation-adjusted value.
              

                 
              

                Silver saw the same pattern. Sales of new silver Eagles more than doubled by weight during Obama's presidency compared to W.Bush, rising by 152%. In real Dollar terms, demand jumped more than 4 times over, rising by 433%.
              

                 
              

                But then, after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in November 2016, demand for gold and silver coins sank. Sales of gold Eagles and Buffalos by the US Mint more than halved both by weight and by value. Month-average sales of silver Eagle coins dropped 46% in ounce terms in 2017-2021, and they fell 61% in inflation-adjusted dollars.
              

                 
              

                Coin demand has since rebounded under Democrat Joe Biden, with monthly silver sales averaging a rise of 20% by weight and 42% by value. Gold coin sales are up 110% in ounces and 158% in real terms.
              

                 
              

                This political split doesn't only impact new gold and silver coins. Across all 'retail' bullion products – adding small bars of gold and silver, and calculating the total net of investor selling – data from the mining industry's World Gold Council and the Washington-base Silver Institute says that US demand almost halved by weight during Trump's first term compared to the prior four years under Obama.
              

                 
              

                But since Biden replaced Trump? Retail US silver investment demand leapt 113% and it trebled for gold.
              

                 
              
 Coin and Small-Bar Demand Tracks the Political Cycle, Not Vaulted Gold or ETFs

                Again, this apparently political pattern – shown on data gathered and produced by specialist consultants Metals Focus – only shows in US demand for bullion in the form of coins and small bars. It doesn't show in US investment demand for securely vaulted wholesale bullion, and it's completely reversed for gold-backed ETF trusts.
              

                 
              

                BullionVault for instance now cares for $5 billion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium owned by more than 100,000 users worldwide. All of that 
               fully allocated precious metal is securely custodied and insured in each client's choice of 5 international locations, led by Zurich, Switzerland. And American residents choosing to use this simple, low-cost service have spent 5% less on gold in real terms during Democrat presidencies than they have under Republicans.
              

                 
              

                Starker still is the contrast between US demand for retail gold products and exchange-traded trust funds backed by gold. Because net inflows into gold ETFs have run opposite to demand for coins and small bars under Republican versus Democratic Presidents.
              

                 
              




                 
              


                 Gold ETFs listed in New York, led by the giant GLD product, have grown far less during the Democrats' recent time in the White House than under Republican Presidents.
               

                  
               

                 Indeed, US 
                gold ETFs have shrunk across the past three Democrat administrations combined, needing 38 fewer tonnes of bullion on average to back the number of shares in issue across Obama's two terms and Biden's term since January 2021.
               

                  
               

                 In contrast, Republican W.Bush's second term and Trump's term from 2017-2021 saw US-listed gold ETFs expand by 787 tonnes on average.
               

                  
               
 Gold-Backed ETFs Show the Opposite Pattern to Coins and Small Bars

                 This pattern in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds runs counter to US bullion coin and small-bar demand. Instead, flows into US-listed gold ETFs map the direction of gold prices much more closely.
               

                  
               

                 Adjusted by inflation to 2024 values, the price of gold has averaged a 4-year gain of 67% during the past two Republican administrations, but it rose only 19% on average under Obama and Biden.
               

                  
               

                 ETF investors, in other words, have tended to buy gold when it's rising, but they held off or even sold when prices flattened or fell. Whereas US citizens buying retail bullion coins or small bars grew their demand during the weaker gold price action seen under Democratic administrations, and they eased back during the stronger bull markets under Republican leaders.
               

                  
               

                 Might this relative discount in precious metals explain the divide in demand better than politics? After all, new coin sales have fallen this year as silver jumps and 
                gold prices set record after record in Joe Biden's final months as Democrat President. And known as 'Dollar-cost averaging', the strategy of growing your gold or silver holdings when prices are lower would be smart.
               

                  
               

                 But retail gold bullion products come at retail prices. So choosing to buy coins or small bars raises your cost of investing – and it therefore dents your gains when prices rise and you choose to sell – compared to 
                trading securely vaulted wholesale bullion or using similarly low-cost ETF products. That contradicts the possibility that heavier US coin buying under Democratic Presidents is actually driven by cost-conscious, price-sensitive investors.
               

                  
               

                 What's more, the idea that gold and silver might underperform during a Democrat term of office doesn't feature in any US retail bullion promotions today. So what messages might US voters choosing to invest in gold or silver be responding to instead?
               

                  
               
 Here's How the Case for Investing in Gold and Silver Looks Split by Politics

                 First, there's the economy. It was the No.1 concern for US voters going into Election 2024 according to a Gallup survey.
               

                  
               

                 But while 2-in-3 Republican and Republican-leaning adults said that the economy was ""extremely important"" to how they would vote, barely half as many Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said the same.
               

                  
               

                 Red and blue voters also split over how they feel the economy is performing. This is led by worries over inflation according to an opinion poll by Bankrate. Because while 56% of Republicans named the rising cost of living as their top economic concern, only 28% of Democrats said the same.
               

                  
               

                 Inflation is, of course, one of those key messages targeted by US gold and silver coin promoters. So perhaps it's no wonder that retail bullion sales rise under Democratic Presidents. Because inflation really has been worse when the White House turns blue.

               This table of BullionVault analysis uses data from the St.Louis Fed. It shows how annual inflation since 2001 has on average been higher by over half-a-percentage point under Democratic Presidents than under Republicans.
             

                
             

               Indeed, analysis for the 
              Washington Post says that the cost of living on the official CPI index rose by less under Donald Trump than under any President since Lyndon Johnson in the mid-1960s. Under Biden, in contrast, inflation was worse than during any modern President besides fellow Democrat Jimmy Carter. And back then, in the late 1970s, gold and silver prices vaulted 8-fold and 11-fold respectively to hit what were then all-time highs for US citizens.
             

                
             

               Democrat inflation so far this century has also hurt real wage growth, because incomes were dead-flat across Obama and Biden's time in the White House. Whereas under W.Bush and Trump, American workers on average enjoyed an annual raise of 0.8% in real terms.
             

                
             

               Yet despite higher inflation under the Dems, the US economy has on average performed better in real terms when the White House is blue. The unemployment rate has fallen, and consumer sentiment – just like GDP growth – has been stronger according to BullionVault's analysis of the Michigan Fed's widely-respected survey.
             

                
             

               What drove Democrat growth and inflation? Was it big Democrat tax hikes and budget deficit spending?

                 Contrary to how most people might feel today, the federal government's total tax take has in fact fallen in real terms under Democrat Presidents so far in the 21st Century.
               

                  
               

                 Growth in America's national debt was also lower than it was under Republican administrations. Most dramatically, and again using data from the St.Louis Fed, the amount of money Washington owes to foreign investors and governments grew more slowly in real terms, too.
               

                  
               

                 Part of this is because the two Democrat Presidents since 2001 both cut real-terms spending on defense. More worrying for anyone hoping (or fearing) that Harris win will in November, the Democrats have repeatedly presided over a surge in the cost of servicing the USA's outstanding debt.
               

                  
               

                 The real cost of interest payments on bonds and T-bills jumped on average by 3 percentage points per year under Obama and Biden. That's money they couldn't spend on education, health, defense, welfare or other entitlement programs.
               

                  
               
 'Be Worried and Buy Gold If Harris Wins' Say Republican Campaigners

                 ""No matter what the economy or the government policies are, gold and silver are assets that have stood the test of time,"" says Trump supporter and right-wing social media 'agitator' Laura Loomer, promoting a gold IRA provider to her 1.3 million followers on X.com.
               

                  
               

                 Whereas ""Being at the whim of the stock market or the Biden Administration doesn't make me feel safe or secure.""
               

                  
               

                 ""I'd be very concerned if Harris is elected,"" agrees hedge-fund billionaire and Trump-campaign fundraiser John Paulson, warning against ""the tax plans and other economic plans that she's articulated"" – in particular, the threat of taxing the wealthiest investors by 25% on their unrealized capital gains.
               

                  
               

                 ""It would cause mass selling of almost everything,"" says Paulson: ""Stocks, bonds, housing, art. That would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate recession."" So he will sell stocks and switch into ""cash and gold"" instead if Kamala Harris beats Trump this November and starts to implement radical left economic policies in 2025.
               

                  
               

                 But is gold or silver bullion always a good investment when Democrats replace Republicans in the White House? Not on the evidence so far this century.

                   BullionVault's third and final table might surprise you. Because this analysis, built using data from the St.Louis Fed, S&P, Zillow and the LBMA, confound the idea that the stock market has done best when there was a Republican President, or that gold and silver have soared when there's a Democrat in the White House.
                 


                     
                  

                    Instead – and measuring investment returns after accounting for inflation – gold and silver typically did much better when the GOP ran the Oval Office, whereas stocks performed best when the Dems were in charge.
                  

                     
                  

                    Cash in the bank meanwhile lost purchasing power during 5 of the past 6 presidential terms, falling most badly under Democratic administrations. Residential real estate prices were more mixed, but here again, the average performance of this core household asset has been stronger overall in real terms during GOP presidencies.
                  

                     
                  
 So Should You Sell Gold and Buy Stocks If Harris Beats Trump?

                    None of the analysis offered here can predict the US 2024 Election result, much less how the economy, government or investment assets will perform afterwards. Far from it.
                  

                     
                  

                    Many other factors impact the financial markets besides politics, ranging from Federal Reserve interest rates to the state of the global economy and geopolitical tensions more broadly. And while gold's gains have, historically, been lower under the Dems than the Republicans since 2001, the precious metal jumped to hit record-high prices under both Obama and Biden. This fall's run of fresh all-time highs also marks the best year-to-date gains for gold since 1986, rising more than 28% so far as 
                   fears grow over America's government deficits and debt continuing to surge whoever wins the White House for 2025.
                  

                     
                  

Bottom line? Investing based solely on which political party wins power might not be the best strategy for protecting and growing your wealth. Whoever wins Election 2024, financial volatility and geopolitical tensions look sure to continue if not worsen. That might explain why people living in Democrat-voting states are now researching gold-related terms on Google more than in Republican strongholds.
                  

                     
                  
 Might Gold and Silver Protect You Against Harris Winning the White House?

                    This trend in gold-related search behavior is shown in our interactive map of the USA at the top of this report, and in the data table below. It also echoes a change in another area seen to ""symbolize the culture war between Democrats and Republicans,"" as French newspaper 
                   Le Monde puts it: Gun sales.
                  

                     
                  

                    Like gold and silver coins, demand for firearms in the US also has tended to rise when there's a Democrat in the White House rather than a Republican. Data from the FBI analyzed by BullionVault show that, since the year 2000, background checks for firearms permits have on average been 37% higher under a Democrat president. Background checks have also been 5% higher than the overall average during presidential election years, regardless of the result.
                  

                     
                  

                    Here again however, Democrat voters are increasingly behaving more like people in Republican areas. Asking whether people own or live in a household where someone owns a gun of any kind, the latest NBC News-
                   Wall Street Journal poll found that 41% of registered Democrat voters said 'yes' in late 2023, leaping from 33% five years before. Among Republican voters, the percentage edged up to 66% from 64%.

EVERYONE has a sale price, right? asks Adrian Ash at BullionVault, 
            reporting from Day 1 of the LBMA 2024 precious metals conference in 
             
              Miami
              Hollywood, Florida.


              
           

             I mean, your wedding ring. You would never sell, of course. But really? Is there no gold or silver or platinum price that might make you consider it?
           

              
           

             For some gold investors that price proved to be $2000 and higher, reaching almost $2700 last month. Silver approaching $30 and above has also seen net selling since the last time members of the London Bullion Market Association gathered like this, 12 months ago.
           

              
           

Platinum prices in contrast have 'only' gained 10%, and palladium has dropped around that much.
           

              
           

             But for both of the former monetary precious metals – and while net demand remains poor on the visible data, most especially in retail gold and silver bars and coin products – someone has been taking the other side of that trade, driving prices higher.
           

              
           

             The vast bulk of existing owners have meantime sat on their hands, including the usually price-sensitive markets of south-east Asia, where scrap flows are very quiet given where prices have gone...
           

              
           

             ...with both gold and silver rising by more than 1/3rd against the US Dollar and most other currencies.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""We've seen 35 
            new all-time highs in the gold price this year,"" said John Reade of the mining industry's World Gold Council this morning, chairing the annual LBMA conference's investment session.
           

              
           

             ""Must say, I never thought we'd see almost $2700 in my career.""
           

              
           

             ""I'm having conversations where people tell me they can't see gold trading below $2300 again,"" said one panel member, noting how this year's steep rise and high levels mean gold is ""losing part of the retail market.""
           

              
           

             But while gold has become ""volatile, it's a buy and hold investment,"" said another speaker. ""Distributions in prices are much wider [because] there a lot of different players now. Many are still underinvested.""
           

              
           

             ""People are struggling to explain the rise in gold prices,"" added another. ""But gold is redefining itself as a portfolio asset. The best allocation is around 12-15% – gold is a very effective diversifier. Central banks have realized this...adding gold at these higher prices. Western wealth managers are starting to it again, too.""
           

              
           

Central bank gold demand – whether in chit-chat, meetings or conference panel sessions – certainly continues to plug the gap between the rising price and what LBMA members are seeing in terms of customer demand in their own business. And so for the 2024 conference, the LBMA got a panel of gold-owning central bank reserve managers to explain how they see and use the precious metal.
           

              
           

             Bottom line? Gold isn't held in their liquidity portfolios in case of urgent currency-market intervention. Instead, it's a long-term holding for portfolio stability, because repeated analysis – by their own internal teams – show how gold helps boost the risk-reward profile of a wider spread of assets. And looking ahead, today's central-bank session agreed that both the value of total FX reserves and the proportion of those reserves held in gold are expected to keep growing.
           

              
           

             ""Why's that?"" you ask? First because of those portfolio benefits. Second because, well, just read the news. Global politics are a bloody mess, and while November's US election might at least resolve the direction and engagement of the world's dominant power (possibly not all for the bad if Trump wins, according to the geopolitical discussion which kicked off the LBMA conference today), it won't solve that.
           

              
           

             Silver, unlike gold, doesn't enjoy central-bank reserves demand. (Russia recently said it's maybe adding non-gold precious metals to its non-central bank holdings; one of today's central-bank panellists said they looked at silver but the price is too volatile to act as a diversifier). Yet the price has still risen by 35% since the LBMA conference met in Barcelona in October 2024. And even more than in gold, the bulk of private investment action has been to sit tight, rather than take profit.
           

              
           

             Maybe, as the silver table I joined at this evening's roundtable discussions agreed, that's because silver still looks 'cheap' relative both to gold (
            via the Gold/Silver Ratio) and to its historical highs of the past 50 years.
           

              
           

             Silver's big top at $50 in January 1980 would now equate to $200 per Troy ounce in real inflation-adjusted Dollars, and April 2011's re-touch of that level would cost $70. Whereas silver today is trading at $31.

             From all the conversations I've had so far, everyone here thinks we'll see both precious metals trading higher (and higher) for longer (and longer). That sure fits the pattern of LBMA conference attendee forecasts in the past, 
            projecting forwards what the gold market just did."

The GOLD and SILVER industry's premier event gets under way this weekend, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault, ironing his shirts for LBMA 2024 in Miami.

             ...Hurricane Milton 
            permitting.
           

              
           

             Even for those delegates too busy to attend the conference's actual presentations because of business meetings (and/or bailing out their hotel rooms), the No.1 topic of chit-chat will still likely start with a sigh, if not a gasp:
           

              
           

             How in the hell did gold prices get here?
           

              
           




              
           

             Every year, the London Bullion Market Association asks conference attendees where they think the gold price will be trading at the time of the LBMA's next annual event.
           

              
           

             Like any forecast survey, the average reply offers a guide to group-think.
           

              
           

             And just like most other such forecasts, the LBMA conference's crystal ball for gold prices is almost always wrong.
           

              
           

             Only 3 times in the past 16 years, in fact, did LBMA delegates come within 5% of where the gold price got to 12 months later (the bear market low of 2015, the upturn of 2019, and the rising-rates-defying jump of 2023 as it happens). And as our chart shows, that's because...
           

              
           

             ...like with any survey of price forecasts...
           

              
           

             ...people tend to report what they have just seen, projecting either a flat price or the same kind of move into the future, rather than offering any insight into how upcoming events might impact the gold market.
           

              
           

             (Just shift the forecast's red dots by 1 year back 
            to see that at work.)
           

              
           

             On top of this, however, you would hope that the LBMA's industry players do also add a few bucks (or subtract them) to their forecasts to account for what they learn by attending the conference.
           

              
           

             Most importantly, they will also add (or subtract) a couple of hundred bucks based on how busy their own business has been, plus how that activity squares with what friends, competitors, suppliers and customers say they are seeing over a beer or two.
           

              
           

             ""Tumbleweed!"" for instance was the summary from most attendees at 
            LBMA 2023 in Barcelona when asked ""How's business?""
           

              
           

             Hence the very gently bullish outlook for gold given by the average attendee. The price of gold was trading at $1910 per Troy ounce this time last year. That marked a record high for October, just pipping autumn 2020's Covid lockdown price of $1900 when the conference met online.
           

              
           

             But the vast bulk of attendees couldn't understand it, because they serve consumers and physical investors, not central banks or hot-money traders in Comex or Shanghai futures and options. So hardly anyone felt that gold would shoot higher like it has done... 
           

              
           

             ...outstripping the LBMA forecast by a record 33% at $2650 per Troy ounce...
           

              
           

             ...rather than rising only 4% to $1990 as the average delegate expected.
           

              
           

             Why so gloomy on gold? Very plainly, the dreadful events of 7th October didn't figure in anyone's thinking when the LBMA met a week later in Barcelona. Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel, the price of gold was in fact dead-flat for 2023 to date, and it rallied only a little in the immediate aftermath.
           

              
           

             Large investment flows into gold were meantime negative (ETFs had shrunk for 3 years running) while retail bar and coin demand had evaporated, completely upending the bullish chit-chat and forecasts given by mints and dealers one year earlier when the LBMA had met in Lisbon.
           

              
           

             Back then, in 2022, the premiums charged to retail investors by those mints and dealers were so huge, way up at 100% for US silver Eagles, that the 
            conference in Lisbon predicted silver bullion prices would jump by 52% over the following 12 months.
           

              
           

             But while silver did rise to October 2023, it 'only' gained 18%...
           

              
           

             ...while premiums on silver coins sank as demand for gold coins and small bars also melted away in the heat of rising interest rates on cash in the bank.
           

              
           

             Cue not a little shock among coin dealers attending the 2023 event. Dazed and confused barely describes German attendees in particular (and 
            their pain has only grown worse). So while conference stayed bullish for the following 12 months...
           

              
           

             ...forecasting, oddly, a repeat of the prior 12 months' 18% rise with an average prediction of $26.80 for the more industrially-useful precious metal...
           

              
           

             ...next weekend's event will find silver has risen more than twice as fast, up close to 37% to trade around $31.50 at this autumn's event.
           

              
           

             Conference was, in short, wildly wrong yet again last year, but for very interesting reasons. So what news, moods and prejudice might influence the tone and discussions at LBMA 2024?
           

              
           

             First, and with the big political powers of the West increasingly pitched against the Rest, ""Gold still matters to central banks"" as an LBMA session title for next week puts it. Thanks of course to the precious metal's famous ""stability, returns and liquidity"".
           

              
           

But can this decade's post-WW2 record for central-bank gold demand keep running?


              
           

             Second, the 2024 surge in gold prices really took off when Chinese consumers and investors piled in this spring. Cue everyone everywhere to declare that 
            China now leads the market, and it no longer just swallows whatever trading in London and New York says is the price...
           

              
           

             ...but cue 
            Chinese gold demand to evaporate since June (along with People's Bank gold buying, at least 
            on the official data). That begs the question which another panel session will address:
           

              
           

Just what is Asia's impact on precious metals prices?


              
           

             Third, silver gets a starring role at next week's conference too (the PGMs get a 'reasons to be cheerful' session all to themselves as well) thanks not only to 
            silver's fast-growing use in 'green' energy, military and AI technology but also thanks to its fast-slowing mine output growth. 
           

              
           

So might deficits of supply vs. demand send the silver price soaring?


              
           

             Fourth and leading the debate, however, we clearly live in ""Turbulent Times""...the title of next Monday's investment panel discussion.
           

              
           

             Like I say, conference last year missed the impact and importance (if not the horror) of Hamas attacking Israel. But while gold and silver prices have soared since then as Israel's bombardment of Gaza and now its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon threatens to become outright confrontation with Iran, crude oil has not risen (
            well, not yet) while global stock markets have like gold jumped to new all-time highs.
           

              
           

Is gold really the most ghoulish investment? Might its price sink if peace breaks out?


              
           

             Turbulence, in other words, isn't hitting gold, silver, equity and energy prices like you might have expected. Here's hoping it doesn't hit flights to Miami too badly and that the awful forecasts for Hurricane Milton hitting Florida prove as wide of the mark as last year's gold and silver conference price outlook.

Article:Beware the rate-cut hangover...

 IMAGINE you're packed shoulder to shoulder in a huge arena to see your favorite band, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 The group is ripping through the final number of its encore performance and the scene is getting wild. A wall of sound slams into the sweaty crowd as everyone shouts along to the final verse. Fireworks ignite, drumsticks fly, and the singer thanks the crowd...
 Everyone hustles off stage and the house lights come up as the cheering crowd starts to settle. You and thousands of strangers waited months to see this show – and it didn't disappoint.
 Now, it's over.
 You're left drenched in sweat, ears ringing, completely exhausted. Everyone around you is aimlessly shuffling around trying to find the exit. You're squinting to adjust to the newly bright conditions, still buzzing from the music as you slowly fade back to reality. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
 Well, folks, it wasn't nearly as exciting as a rock concert. But last month's rate cut and its immediate aftermath have dragged many of these same feelings out of your fellow investors.
 We were led into the main event with plenty of over-the-top media fanfare, promising a brand new rate cut regime. And when Powell pulled the trigger, we were treated to 50 bps to kick off the show. Expectations were high – and the Fed delivered.
 The rest of the week was a blur. After a little hesitation following the announcement, the Dow and the S&P 500 managed to log new all-time highs the next trading day. The party was on!
 But the house lights are back on. The music's over. All that's left are throngs of dazed investors wandering in circles, waiting to see what happens next...
 ...and new all-time highs never felt so...uneventful.
 Maybe investors are just hungover from the rate-cut noise pumped into their living rooms for the past month. Perhaps we're simply dealing with a classic case of recency bias spurred by the late summer selloff. Or maybe the lackluster moves led by utilities and staples soured the mood.
 Any of these scenarios could have spoiled the bull market vibe.
 But I think the bulk of the blame lies with the Fed's interest rate decision.
 Everyone knew a cut was coming and came into that Wednesday ready to party. But now that the main event is over, the Fed's policy shift is only creating more uncertainty. Investors from Broad & Wall to Main Street are racking their brains to decipher what drove the FOMC's decision – and what could mean for the rest of the year.
 Did the Fed wait too long to cut? Are they behind the curve, just like they were in 2022? Does a double-cut mean we're hurtling toward an imminent recession?
 I have no idea. But I do know that I'm not worried about the dreaded R-word. Instead, I prefer to focus on price and the underlying trend – two facts on which we can rely during any market environment.
 Whether you choose to follow price or not, one thing is certain: No one likes change. Resist as we might, as scary as it may be, the rate-cut cycle is here.
 And that's not all...
 Third-quarter earnings season festivities will quickly follow. Fall is suddenly upon us. Now's the perfect time to review how stocks are faring and the potential seasonal headwinds that lie ahead following this rate-cut uncertainty.
 October marks a critical turning point for stocks. It concludes the worst six months of the year for US equities, kicking off the best time of year to buy stocks.
 October not only signals a significant shift in seasonal trends – it also has a knack for bottom-ticking the market, marking the low of 13 bear markets since World War II, per Trader's Almanac (most recently, the Dow ripped 14% in October 2022).
 But here's the thing: We've not been experiencing a bear market.
 Stock market bulls aren't searching for potential support zones. Instead, they're exploring unchecked levels of overhead supply.
 First half leaders are making up lost ground following the late summer selling session. Rotation is leading to broadening participation beneath the surface. And a new leadership group is emerging: small-caps. These conditions would be better described as the second year of a bull run, as opposed to the end of an ugly downtrend.
 Bull vs. Bear aside, the presidential election will take place in November. When it comes to the average October performance during election years, seasonal tailwinds favor the bears.
 The average October returns during election years since 1950 look like this: Dow -1%, S&P 500 -0.9%, Nasdaq -2.2%.
 Let's go a little farther down the seasonality rabbit hole. Remember the stocks-only-go-up frenzy that kicked off 2021? It was impossible to miss! The stock market was handing out participation trophies made of solid gold...everyone's a winner!
 Later that year, reality set in as IWM tanked during November, its strongest seasonal month of the year.
 Stocks in 2024 instead stayed green during September, traditionally the weakest month of the year. In fact, a traditionally volatile September turned into an absolute barnburner, the first positive September in five years.
 That's a welcome change for investors, who've recently dealt with some downright dreadful Septembers recently (S&P dropped almost 5% in September 2023, FactSet notes, and more than 9% in September 2022).
 Bottom line: Seasonality studies serve as a roadmap, not a definitive forecasting tool.
 In fact, the most useful information comes when markets buck seasonal trends (like they're doing right now).
 Your best course of action is to remain cautious and give the market room to work out some of this rate cut angst.
 Anything can happen – but I would not expect an all-out meltdown going forward. Instead, stay alert for a little chop, and maybe a fake out or two lower as we kick off Q4. And keep an eye on the strongest names over the next few weeks. These could be your new leaders when melt up season arrives."
2024-10-02,"Title:Gold Mania? Wait for $3000
Article:Investors absent, central banks hoarding...

 I'VE HAD at least a dozen Uber drivers pitch me on suspect investments, writes Adam Sharp in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 For a while, it seemed like every trip came with free, and invariably horrible, picks.
 Interestingly, I've not had a driver, or a barber for that matter, pitch me on gold and silver. Despite gold regularly breaking out to new highs, we really haven't yet seen any signs of a typical retail mania.
 Looking at Google Trends. There are no signs of increased investor interest in precious metals. Google search volume for ""gold price"" over the last year is showing barely any movement. Other search terms such as ""buy gold online"" or ""gold etf"" – which would indicate growing interest – are similarly flat.
 Despite solid performance, gold and silver are not yet hot commodities. A 2023 survey by Bank of America showed that 71% of financial advisors had a 0-1% allocation to gold. Only 27% had a 1-5% exposure rate.
 Perhaps even worse, only 2% of advisors report a 5-10% allocation to gold. Madness.
 So if investors aren't snatching up all the gold, what's driving the price up?
 Central bankers are buying in droves. The chart below shows purchases by country in 2024 through July.
 
 According to the World Gold Council, central banks added 37 tons in July alone. That's up 206% month-over-month.
 There's no sign of central banks slowing their buying anytime soon. It's also important to note that we don't have great data on Russia or China, which could both be buying substantially more bullion than reported.
 There's rich irony in the fact that the primary gold bulls today aren't individual investors, it's the guys running the fiat printers. This is an insider buy signal at a global scale. And these aren't fickle day traders in for a quick flip. These central banks have a new reserve policy, and it appears to heavily favor gold.
 Over the past 75 years, the US Dollar emerged as the world's leading international reserve asset. It eclipsed gold in the early 1990s and remains dominant to this day. But the trend has finally flipped. Today, gold as a percent of international reserves is climbing, and the Dollar is falling.
 This is a monumentally important trend. De-Dollarization is actually beginning to happen. But central banks aren't switching to the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro, they're reverting to classic hard currency: gold. It's re-goldification on a massive scale.
 The era of fiat dominance may well be in its twilight years. And good riddance. Being home to the world's reserve currency has hollowed out the US manufacturing base and caused spending to spiral out of control.
 All of this helps confirm my view that we are still very early on precious metals. Fed printing operations are just now about to start back up. QE will eventually reignite, and the scale will likely dwarf previous episodes within a few years. Depending on who wins the White House, a stimulus program may be in the works as well.
 Gold and silver are absolutely crucial aspects of a modern portfolio, and are still wildly under-owned by investors. In the next 5 years, we will likely see a number of sovereign debt crises, and/or sustained inflation above 10% in a number of countries. The piles of government debt have simply grown out of control.
 Lower interest rates will help cut the debt servicing costs (interest expenses). But there's a good chance it will also reaccelerate inflation. No matter which path we choose, the piper will be paid for past excesses.
 Eventually, we will experience a true precious metal mania. I suspect it will begin when gold hits $3000 and silver breaks out above $49.45, its 1980 all-time high. Everyone will be buzzing about gold and silver. Your neighbors, friends, and colleagues. And it will be glorious.
 Fortunately, we're not there yet and still have time to prepare. We may even get a pullback after gold's impressive run from $2000 in Feb 2024. But then again, we may not..."
2024-10-01,"Title:Gold Investors Take Profit Again at Record Prices, Silver Too
Article:But gold and silver bullion investments still hit record value...


              
           


GOLD and SILVER's latest price surge to fresh all-time and multi-year highs has spurred yet more profit-taking by private investors on world-leading marketplace BullionVault, 
            writes Adrian Ash at the West London fintech, now caring for $5.0 billion of precious metals for over 100,000 users in 175 countries worldwide.


              
           

             But while silver investment sentiment has also turned negative for the first time since May, sentiment towards gold remains positive, and the value of investors' gold and silver holdings has reached a fresh Dollar record as outflows are tempered by an upturn in first-time buyers in the USA and UK.
           

              
           

             Indeed, gold investment buyers have now outnumbered sellers for six months in a row, even as 
            gold prices run to fresh record highs.
           

              
           

             But any notion that 'safe haven demand' has pushed the market to these new record highs misses the fact that it's 
            speculators in gold futures and options driving precious metals prices higher, rather than physical buyers.
           

              
           

             Because with global stock markets continuing to rise and a US recession delayed if not averted, long-time bullion owners are only too happy to keep taking investing profits at these new record prices.
           

              
           




              
           

             The price of gold typically falls in September, as 
            analysts and pundits rushed to point out this time 4 weeks ago.
           

              
           

             But last month gold broke that pattern with its steepest September jump since 2012, rising 4.6% in Dollar terms, 2.7% in Sterling and 3.8% in Euros while setting a fresh daily record 7 times for UK investors at London's bullion market auctions – the global price benchmark – and 9 times for US and Euro investors.
           

              
           

             In response, and tracking the number of buyers over sellers on BullionVault – which finds 9-in-10 of its global customer base in North America and Western Europe – the Gold Investor Index fell 0.8 points to a 5-month low of 52.0, a series low for the month of September.
           

              
           

             This unique measure of market sentiment would read 50.0 if the number of buyers exactly matched the number of sellers. 
            The Gold Investor Index peaked at a decade high of 65.9 as the pandemic took hold in March 2020, and it set a record low of 47.5 this March – signalling more sellers than buyers for the first time since June 2019 – when prices began 2024's run of new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Underpinning gold's dramatic uptrend, the start of US interest-rate cuts is now adding to the support coming from worsening geopolitical division and the risk of major-power conflict around the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East wars.
           

              
           

             And while existing gold investors continue banking some of their gains to rebalance their portfolios, the pace of selling remains measured even at gold's fresh all-time highs, and new investment buyers continue to enter the market.
           

              
           

             By weight, investors using BullionVault cut their combined gold holdings by 353 kilograms last month – the heaviest net liquidation since April's record 992kg outflow – down to a new 50-month low beneath 44.5 tonnes.
           

              
           

             But by value, those holdings – all securely stored and insured in specialist vaults in each client's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or most popular Zurich – grew 3.8% to a new record above $3.7 billion (+2.0% to £2.8bn, +3.0% to €3.3bn, both also a new record).
           

              
           

             September's count of new users worldwide at BullionVault slipped 6.5% from August's 4-month high, but it came in 118.4% above the same month last year and rose 29.0% from its prior 12-month average.
           

              
           

             Within those numbers, first-time investors in the US and UK rose to the highest monthly count since April, up 20.0% and 5.5% respectively from August's figure and coming 75.6% and 44.6% above their prior 12-month average.
           

              
           

             New users in the Eurozone in contrast fell 25.6% month-on-month, led by a 36.0% drop in France and a 45.5% fall in Italy, with continued weakness in Germany seeing the 20-nation currency union as a whole bring only 2.5% more new users in September than the prior 12-month average.
           

              
           

             So like with this spring's brief rally in Italy and then France, the current jump in US and UK first-time bullion buyers looks specific to short-term domestic uncertainty. November's US election could go either way, while the UK Budget due at the end of this month is raising anxiety among consumers, business and investors over the new Labour Government's tax and spending plans.
           

              
           




              
           

             Silver prices have also tended to drop in September, falling in 8 of the 10 years to 2023.
           

              
           

             But like gold, the more industrially-useful precious metal leapt in price last month gaining 8.3% in Dollars – and hitting its highest since Christmas 2012 – while rising 6.5% in UK Pounds and 7.4% in Euro terms.
           

              
           

             In response, the Silver Investor Index fell hard, down 4.2 points to a 4-month low of 48.9 and signalling more sellers than buyers for the first time since May. That was when the Dollar price had risen through $32 per Troy ounce for the first time in over 11 years, a level it re-took but then lost again last month.
           

              
           

             Seizing on silver's latest spike, investors sold 12.0 tonnes more of the precious metal than they bought across September as the price hit new 12-year highs. That marked the first net liquidation since May, and it cut client holdings to 1,167 tonnes.
           

              
           

             Worth 4.3% more by Dollar value from August however, that set a new record for BullionVault users' silver holdings at $1.1bn in terms of the US currency, but it missed a new record in Sterling or Euros, rising 2.4% to £865m and 3.3% to €1.0bn, both below May's peak value.
           

              
           

             Still, with prices rising faster than the pace of investor selling, the total value of BullionVault's client holdings overall rose to a new record in all 3 currencies in September, reaching $5.0 billion (£3.7bn, €4.4bn) when counting the gold, silver, platinum and palladium, all securely stored and insured in specialist vaults, belonging to more than 100,000 users from 175 countries.
           

              
           

             What comes next? Looking ahead, it's hard to believe that last week's gold tops above $2680 and £2000 and €2400 per Troy ounce will mark a long-term peak like New Year 1980, summer 2011 or even summer 2020 did.
           

              
           

             That's because, contrary to all the talk about 'safe haven demand', Western investors have been selling or ignoring precious metals, not buying the stuff.
           

              
           

             Imagine what happens when they get involved again. The next $5 billion might arrive a lot faster than the first."
2024-09-30,"Title:Chips, Rice and Protectionism: A Big Success?
Article:Trade tariff lessons from WW2 and modern Japan...

 The BASIC CONCEPT of Economic Nationalism is that a policy is good if it benefits members of the Nation, which basically means the members of commonwealth, or State, writes Nathan Lewis on his New World Economics blog.
 If it doesn't benefit the members of the Nation, then what makes it good?
 For example:
 Let's say that there's an automobile factory in Detroit. But Ford decides that it would like to build its newest factory in Georgia, not Detroit, for whatever reason.
 This might be bad for workers in Detroit. But it would be good for workers in Georgia. We calculate that, since both Georgia and Detroit are part of the Nation, then it is something of a zero-sum, at worst.
 Workers in Detroit can even just move to Georgia and work in the new factory. But competition between Michigan and Georgia is also good, because it tends to lead to better outcomes overall. In terms of Economic Nationalism, it is a positive.
 But let's say that Ford wants to build a factory in Mexico. Now Mexicans benefit, from more good-paying jobs, and Americans do not benefit, although you could argue that they benefit a little bit from perhaps lower selling prices of Ford automobiles.
 Unemployed factory workers in Michigan cannot easily migrate to Mexico; nor would they want to, given the low wages in Mexico. However, all economists agree that wealth comes from Production and Productivity, and we have just made Americans less productive, because they no longer have a factory to make cars, and are instead standing around unemployed. Basically, Capital is leaving the US, resulting in a poorer Capital/Labor Ratio.
 Thus, if we look at the actual history of the United States, we find that it is based on absolute Free Trade within the Nation (among States), and generally a long history of Protectionism, or Tariffs, with the rest of the world – ie, other Nations. This makes sense, from the standpoint of Economic Nationalism.
 There is nothing in economic theory, of the ""general economic principles"" variety, that can make sense of the National difference between a factory in Georgia and a factory in Mexico. They just assume that – since Free Trade is very good between the States of the United States, then the same principle applies also for the whole world, because we are too lazy to think if this is actually true or not.
 During the 1960s, there was a fairly strong movement toward Economic Independence, or the idea that a country should try to make goods and services domestically, rather than being dependent on imports.
 This had a political aspect. If you were completely dependent on fossil fuel imports, and had no domestic sources of energy, then you would be at the total mercy of others exporting fossil fuels to you. This might seem fanciful, but it is exactly what happened to Japan, which was almost totally dependent on imports of petroleum.
 When imports from Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia were cut off in June 1941, it left Japan completely dependent on imports from the United States. When the US cut off oil exports to Japan in September 1941, Japan had basically been served a death sentence. The reaction was to gain control of the oilfields of Indonesia.
 Indonesia was then known as the Netherlands East Indies, since it was ruled by the Netherlands. But ""the Netherlands"" no longer existed. It was under German military occupation since 1940, and Germany was a defensive ally in the anti-communist Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936. It made sense for Japan to grab the oilfields of the undefended Netherlands East Indies. But this was blocked by the US Fleet at Subic Bay, in the Philippines, and also Hawaii; and the British outpost at Singapore, which controlled the Strait of Malacca. To secure the shipping lanes between Indonesia and Japan, the Japanese military attacked both the US naval bases in the Philippines and Hawaii, and Singapore.
 It is not very well remembered today that the Japanese government actually promoted self-rule for the former European colonies in Asia, including the Netherlands East Indies. Of course it would be something of a ""puppet government"", and a friendly posture toward the occupiers was basically mandatory – the same as Japan itself after WW2. But, it nevertheless would have had a lot of control over domestic conditions.
 So we see that securing natural resources, and not being dependent on (potentially unfriendly) foreign sources for key items, has actually been a big deal in the past.
 Since that time, we've learned that most countries really cannot hope for any meaningful form of economic self-reliance. Most countries have no meaningful fossil fuels, and are dependent on imports. Attempts to create domestic manufacturing industries, or ""import substitution"" as it was called, have mostly been a failure. People in Honduras, Vietnam, or Morocco are much better off buying an iPhone from Apple than trying to make their own domestic smartphones. People in Mozambique, Portugal or the Philippines are much better off buying an automobile from Ford or Toyota than trying to make their own automobiles. Actually, there has been a trend for international manufacturers to establish domestic factories, such as a Honda plant in Brazil, but even these are commonly dependent on long supply chains from around the world.
 Since countries have to pay for these imports somehow, they also have to sell something to the rest of the world. Thus, we get a tendency toward Specialization and Trade, at the national level as well.
 While this is almost unavoidable for most countries in the world, which are not very big and cannot have any meaningful hope of ""economic self-reliance"" in a state of contemporary industrialization, the larger countries, which basically have ""superpower"" militaries, see things differently. Mostly, this is the US, Russia, China, and Europe taken as a whole – the EU.
 While fossil fuel or automobile or electronics ""independence"" is hardly realistic for most countries, nearly any country can aspire to generate most or all of its own food. This is, of course, perhaps even more important than fossil fuels, when it comes to avoiding potential means of aggression by foreign governments.
 Also, although cars and iPhones are modern features, nearly every locality has a centuries-old tradition of local farming. We don't feel this in the United States so much, but what does it mean for France or Japan to see its domestic agriculture tradition basically disappear, because it is cheaper to import food from Brazil? To see the fields that have been cultivated literally for centuries, become abandoned or built over? What if the Japanese no longer grew rice, not because rice fields don't exist – they do – but because Thai or California rice was cheaper?
 This leads to a natural effort to ""protect"" local agriculture. Japan has long had a policy that all rice would be domestically grown, with prices rising to the point to make this possible. No rice imports. This of course infuriates California rice growers, but it makes a lot of sense for Japan.
 Japan imports more than half of all its food anyway. However, the rice policy both preserves an ancient tradition, and core component of culture and national identity, and also at least preserves a substantial and meaningful level of food independence, even if Japan falls far short of becoming a net food exporter like the United States.
 (If you are wondering, the high inherent cost of growing rice in Japan has led to a tendency toward quality. Japanese rice is very, very good. There are farms in California that attempt to grow rice that is as good as the rice from Japan. As a rice enthusiast, I can say that Japanese rice, and also these super-premium California brands, are far better than the cheaper options, and well worth the extra price, even though they can cost five or ten times as much – about $3 a pound, or $4 for organic – than the 50lb bag at Costco. The super-premium California brands like our personal favorite, Kagayaki, cost the same as Japanese rice.)
 Today the United States, which is not very concerned about food (it is a huge food producer), or fossil fuels, is instead concerned about semiconductor chip supply. ""Specialization and Trade"" has led to most US chips coming from Taiwan and elsewhere – all of which could be potentially cut off, much as Japan's oil supply was cut off by the United States in September 1941.
 This extends not only to chips, but electronics components throughout the supply chain, and also the very sophisticated robotic machines that today assemble these components into final products. Even if ""electronics self-reliance"" is perhaps difficult at this time, at least there should be a substantial local industrial base. This not only insures at least some supply, but also the engineering and managerial knowledge that could ramp up this local supply quickly if necessary.
 The Economic Nationalists see these needs clearly, while the ""general economics principles"" people have really nothing to go on to make a decision one way or another on this. It would mean violating their ""general economics principles"", leaving them often with nothing.
 Like most real-world situations, these things also change with time. Taiwan semiconductor supply was not that much of a concern in 2005; and now it is a big concern. Recently:
 
 There are a number of things potentially wrong with this, but also a number of things potentially right. It certainly would prompt a move toward economic self-reliance, since local industries would have a substantial advantage selling in the local market.
 Note also that this avoids the terrible item-by-item approach for Broad Flat Tariffs, 20% on everything, and an (additional?) 60% on China.
 Of course it is not quite so simple. It would make sense for Chinese products to pass through the Philippines, for instance, and be sprinkled with magic fairy dust making them ""Philippine products"" for export to the US. But, nevertheless, it could be the start of a good policy – especially combined with tax cuts elsewhere, as Patrick Buchanan argued. He suggested eliminating the corporate income tax, making the overall economic effect (higher tariffs, lower other taxes) a strong positive.
 During the entire 19th century, the United States had very high tariffs, and no income taxes at all. It was a big success."
2024-09-27,"Title:Mortgage Refi Booms for Goldilocks
Article:But ask why rates are falling...

 SOME MEDIA, along with anecdotal sources witnessed on X, are trumpeting how strong the economy will be in 2025, using a mortgage refinance boom as a rationale, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 While that will put some tailwind to the economy, my view is that it is simply one factor extending the Goldilocks economic phase – characterized by fading inflation signals/expectations and a still intact (but not as intact as portrayed) economy – conveniently, in alignment with NFTRH's favored ""to or through the election"" projection for the economy and by association, markets.
 This article simply notes the ""boom"" in refinancing, without really extrapolating it further to a ""strong economy"" view.
 But the public is well aware that rates are coming down (our target is 3.2% or so on the 30-year Treasury yield) and certain entities are going to promote that as ""inflation is easing"" and ""the economy is improving"" to serve agenda.
 And I'm not only talking politics, as the massive financial services industry has skin in the game of keeping the public docile and obedient (ie, not trying to pull its capital out of the markets and out of its advisors' pockets).
 For effect, here is the 30yr yield once again, as it is now and has long been one of my favorite pictures into the macro. You can see the basis for the 3.2% yield projection. It's the former backbone (now broken) that had held yields in check for decades. Now it will act as support.
 
 Market participants are celebrating the decline in yields and the softening Fed. But they are weakening and softening for a reason.
 If that reason (a weakening economy) persists, and policymakers (fiscal and/or monetary) react as they have historically, the future inflation problem could be severe...and the Continuum would factor that by holding the 3.2% area and turning up into the next phase.
 But that's all future projection. For now, why don't we just turn off our brains like the legions of FOMO-driven MOMOs entering markets from stocks to (now) commodities to – sorry my buggish friends – precious metals.
 In discussing future negatives, I am not talking my book because my book includes all of the things listed just above, and no short positions. My book has been ""to or through the election"" all year. My book projected Goldilocks over 1.5 years ago.
 It's probably important to note who was saying what, when. I am not a perma-bear. I am a guy telling what I see."
2024-09-26,"Title:Hey Gary, Why No 'Imminent' Concern?
Article:SEC slip-up hints at fresh financial fears...

 OOPS, says Adam Sharp in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Last week the SEC accidentally published internal commentary along with a speech by Chair Gary Gensler. Here's one of the comments which was mistakenly included.
 ""I strongly recommend that a sentence be placed here (or somewhere in the first part of the speech) to reassure markets that you are not making the speech because you think there is an imminent crisis.""
 These internal comms were quickly deleted from SEC.gov, but not before the page was archived for posterity. The slip-up reveals anxiety among regulators over messaging.
 Mr.Gensler's speech addressed financial crises, bank restructurings, and the importance of public disclosures. In it, the SEC Chair rightly argued that depositors need transparency to make good decisions.
 ""If a large financial institution is restructured, the market's need for disclosure doesn't go away. Indeed, I believe the market's need for robust disclosure becomes all the more critical. First, it is the best way to ensure that investors, counterparties, and depositors will have sufficient confidence to remain with the firm.""
 It's a solid point, transparency does need to improve. But there's something else missing here that we need to discuss.
 Back in June, Daily Reckoning's Jim Rickards warned that the banking crisis may still have legs.
 ""Investors are relaxed because they believe the banking crisis is over. That's a huge mistake. History shows that major financial crises unfold in stages and have a quiet period between the initial stage and the critical stage.""
 In the article, Mr.Rickards pointed out a key flaw with Mr.Gensler's argument that transparency should allow depositors to make wise decisions. That flaw is the speed at which money moves in today's world.
 ""On the other hand, this crisis could reach the acute stage faster. That's because of technology that makes a bank run move at the speed of light. With an iPhone, you can initiate a $1 billion wire transfer from a failing bank while you're waiting in line at McDonald's. No need to line up around the block in the rain waiting your turn.
 ""When a crisis hits, rational analysis is often the first casualty. In this world where money moves in a blink, if you hear about potential issues at your bank, most of us aren't going to pull up its financial filings, spend hours analyzing them, and then make a decision. We're going to move it to a safer bank (or a mattress, or into gold) ASAP.""
 So while it is good to hear that the SEC Chair favors more transparency, it doesn't do much to allay our concerns. More disclosure could actually accelerate a crisis due to the velocity of information and money today. If a crisis hits, things can happen fast.
 Let's get back to those accidentally-published internal comments. An SEC staffer was concerned that Mr.Gensler's speech might give the impression of an ""imminent crisis"". Whenever regulators discuss the solvency of financial institutions there's a risk that it is interpreted negatively by markets. It's a valid worry.
 Unfortunately, in this market, there are some excellent reasons to interpret the remarks in a cautious light. Let's start with the latest data on unrealized losses at banks.
 
 Remember when this chart was making the rounds in 2022 and 2023?
 The updated FDIC data continues to show an unprecedented and sustained rise in unrealized losses at banks. Notice how small the losses during the global financial crisis appear in comparison.
 These are unrealized losses on banks' bond portfolios, primarily caused by the Fed's rapid interest rate hikes. When rates rise, the value of existing bonds (with lower yields than new bonds) falls. This is what caused the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.
 Unrealized losses stand at $512 billion as reported by the FDIC, down from a peak of around $655 billion. The data has improved a bit, but bank balance sheets remain stressed at historic levels.
 Ongoing interest rate cuts should help stem the unrealized bleeding at banks. As rates fall, the price of bonds will rise. But lower rates should also mean lower profitability for the lending side of the business, so it's somewhat of a double-edged sword for banks.
 Even if the unrealized loss situation gets resolved, there are other potential black swans to monitor. After all, why is the Fed planning to cut rates, apparently with haste? Are they simply trying to get ahead of bank losses and soaring debt servicing costs? Or do they potentially see a recession or financial crisis in the near future?
 Let's review our situation. The Fed is preparing for economic turbulence. Gold is trying to tell us something as it powers to new all-time highs. Job growth for the year was recently revised sharply downward. And now regulators are making speeches about restructuring large financial institutions.
 It sure feels like something's brewing. If you want to be proactive and check your bank's unrealized loss ratio, you can use a free tool by Florida Atlantic University. This screener isn't perfect and doesn't tell you everything about a bank's health, but it's a start.
 Besides moving to a better bank, gold and silver remain an excellent way to prepare for potential calamities."
2024-09-25,"Title:Putting the Tin Foil Hat Aside
Article:But still asking: Why cut now? Why so deep...?

  The September 22 edition of Notes From the Rabbit Hole (#828) had some things to say about the FOMC action last week, before putting its tin foil hat back in the closet, getting down to the business of managing markets
 The FED held off, held off, held off some more, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 It held rates at a high level for meeting after meeting, despite the fade in inflation signals that we've expected (and now seen) since Q1 2023 (Goldilocks), unemployment that has long-since based and turned up, and despite the fact that it has been government itself – along with embedded and lagging services industries – that have kept the employment numbers afloat.
 This is leaving aside the fact that BLS has revised these headline numbers down. This begs the question, why even pay attention to Payrolls as initially reported?
 It begs another question. Why cut now, and why cut by an attention grabbing 50 basis points? Why did a President barely in possession of his faculties weigh in and protesteth too much, only to be caught in a lie (or a mental lapse) about having sat with the Fed Chief? Why?
 Maybe because new highs for the S&P 500 at a strategic pre-election juncture supports our long-held bull view of ""to or through the election"".

 Putting the tin foil hat aside, let's be clear on a couple things.
 I have consciously kept my tin foil hat in the closet since initially falling down the Rabbit Hole in the 2002-2004 time frame. Back then came a greenhouse, organic/heirloom gardening (well, an attempt, anyway), 20-year food supplies, a generator, wood stoves and gold, guns and ammo.
 A lunatic? Sure. I went that way for a period in time. But for 20 years now I have been working at being even keeled, tuning down the paranoia and simply viewing modern life as it is and hence, modern markets as they are (not how my tin foil hat advised that they are, or how I wanted them to be).
 The other point I want to make clear is that I am no Trump supporter. It probably should be re-stated because I've been making plenty of loaded statements (based on the facts of the employment data, the fiscal stimulus operations, etc) about the Biden administration and the Democrats' apparent initiatives to keep the White House.
 But those who knew me in 2016-2020 time frame know all too well that I probably went overboard making fun of, criticizing and debunking the lies of the orange man.
 My job is to tell what I see; my interpretation of the truth. It is not to support either decrepit political party or add to the disinformation that is now the norm, thanks to social media and the divisions getting ever more pronounced in society.
 So let's leave it at this:
 For whatever reason, the Fed chose to hold off until this point of the final lap toward the election and you can see above the immediate reaction. What' more, the SPX chart has now been shoved upward from a triple top structure to a breakout structure.
 Could fail tomorrow. Could gain energy and power ""to or through the election"". Funny how this story comes together in line with our ongoing thesis, eh? Or maybe it's not so funny."
2024-09-23,"Title:The 'Big Idea' of Cigar Butt Investing
Article:How to get rich slowly and surely with value...

 THERE is a great deal of redundancy, me-tooism and superfluity in the provision of fund management, writes Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 There are too many funds out there versus legitimate investor demand. ('Many are launched, but few are chosen.') More fund managers should be asked, 'What's your big idea?'
 This is an easy question to ask, but a tough question to answer briefly.
 The great value investor, Benjamin Graham, did a pretty good job of answering briefly when he wrote, in the very last chapter of 'The Intelligent Investor':
 ""Confronted with a challenge to distil the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto: MARGIN OF SAFETY.""
 Those three words contain an entire universe of wisdom.
 Safety, of course, means different things to different people. And these days, real safety is a tough thing to come by – it may even be impossible.
 Nevertheless, here's our preferred definition. If we first define risk as the likelihood of incurring a permanent loss of capital – the complete and irreversible destruction of your pension fund, for example – then safety has to be the polar opposite. A 'safe' investment, or one approaching the characteristic of safety, is one that offers the least foreseeable likelihood of incurring a permanent loss of capital.
 To go one stage further in the cause of total clarity, a 'safe' investment is one that also accords the investor a meaningful likelihood of retaining his or her purchasing power over the medium and longer term.
 A lot of things flow from these simple concepts.
 Before we discovered Benjamin Graham, we stumbled upon Daniel Bernoulli. He popped up within the text of Peter L.Bernstein's 1998 book 'Against the Gods': a history of risk that we would recommend to any investment market 'completist'.
 Bernoulli, an 18th Century Dutch mathematician and physicist, once remarked:
 ""The utility resulting from any small increase in wealth will be inversely proportionate to the quantity of goods previously possessed.""
 It's a rather dry-sounding statement, couched in very scientific, if not economist-like, language. But when we came across it in 1998 or 1999, while working for Merrill Lynch, it struck us like a lightning bolt.
 Bear in mind that, at the time, the world and his wife were stampeding over themselves in their efforts to make obscene profits in internet stocks. Our almost immediate response to Bernoulli was to conclude that ""everyone else"" was doing it wrong. What would most matter to our clients, being either affluent, wealthy or very wealthy, would not be how much they might make on an investment – but how much they stood to lose.
 It was during the first dotcom boom that we also came across the wonderful quote by Lord Overstone:
 ""No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich.""
 The only real problem with Benjamin Graham's 'margin of safety' observation – and all that naturally flows from it – is that it's a 'get rich slow' or 'stay rich' approach. That may have limited appeal to those seeking a sudden and dramatic uptick in their fortunes.
 But we think every investor has to pursue an approach that sits easily with their own mental furniture. And we're happy to take a patient view of things. Patience favours the 'margin of safety' investor.
 Bernoulli's observation is probably a little closer to conventional wisdom now. It's difficult for us to say, because we've been living with a focus on absolute return investing for so long now it's difficult to remember having ever invested any other way. But we maintain that Bernoulli still has a claim – among all his other achievements – to be one of the world's first behavioural economists.
 The likes of Kahneman and Tversky have more recently confirmed through extensive research the essential truth of what Bernoulli said three centuries ago: human beings, and especially wealthy human beings, hate losing money far more than they enjoy making it. Hence our focus, ever since discovering Bernoulli, on absolute – as opposed to market-relative – investing.
 So this 'big idea' isn't just good for your portfolio, it's good for your psychological health, too.
 Like we say, this is genuinely a 'big idea' in every sense, because its implications are far-reaching and profound. Let's drill a little deeper into some of the implications of 'margin of safety'.
 One of them is that equity investments, for example, can possess certain 'safe-ish' characteristics almost entirely independently of the sector they represent or the type of businesses they are. This is what Warren Buffett described as 'cigar butt' investments – shares of businesses that had perhaps one last puff in them but which were being given away for free. If you buy shares of any company when those shares are trading at a meaningful discount to that company's inherent worth / liquidation value / book value, then you don't even need to worry about the longer term prospects for that company; if it gets wound up, you still expect to make a profit.
 But 'cigar butt' (aka 'deep value') investing doesn't interest us so much, just as Buffett himself moved on from it over the course of his career. Value traps are still traps. Instead, we're more interested in sustainable businesses with a history of superior shareholder returns and highly competent management – but only when the shares of those businesses happen to be on sale, for whatever reason.
 Those last three words – ""for whatever reason"" – are also important. Because one thing that flows from the 'margin of safety' approach, at least from our perspective, is that price is far more important than any other subjective characteristic in an investment. Price is in many respects the only thing that matters.
 A case in point. When we were buying certain mining and commodity company shares within our fund several years ago, a number of highly respected analysts at a data and news company that shall remain nameless (though it rhymes with 'Roomberg') told us that we were mad.
 ""Iron ore? Oh, that sector's had it. The commodity boom is over.""
 If we had allowed ourselves to fall victim to a (wholly subjective) narrative about the commodities market at the time, we would never have made the investments in question, and we and our investors would have missed out on the double- and in some cases triple-digit returns that we subsequently enjoyed.
 In other words, so long as any company's underlying operations are sound, and ideally improving, and that company is making money whilst carrying little or no debt, a) it doesn't matter what the crowd thinks about that company or the sector it's in and b) it doesn't matter that its share price is temporarily under pressure.
 There may even be technical reasons for the share price to be lagging the rest of the market that have absolutely nothing to do with that company's underlying profitability or revenue growth. It might be, for example, that a large fund just got hit with some heavy redemptions by clients, and is liquidating part of its portfolio, and shares of that company just happen to be among those being sold because they're more liquid than the fund's other holdings. The recent history of any company's share price tells you almost nothing about its underlying health – only about sentiment toward that company in the stock market.
 Ben Graham tended to focus on book value as the metric par excellence, but it's worth noting that book value today is somewhat less relevant than it was in a pre-Internet, less technological age, when so many more businesses were involved in things like extractive industry or manufacturing. In a more services-driven world, book value struggles to give a fair reflection of the underlying worth of a business when the intangible value of so many companies, comprised of things like brand value and intellectual property, is so high.
 But there are plenty of other 'margin of safety' metrics we can use. Here are a few others that we use in screening for stock selection:
 A minimum 10% cashflow from operations (CFO) yield Cashflow from operations is the purest form of cash that a company can generate, because it isn't ""tainted"" by cashflow that can come about from either investment or financing – both of which can swing about wildly and be manipulated by management. The CFO yield is calculated by dividing cash from operations by the total value of the company's debt and equity.
 A price / earnings (p/e) ratio of less than 15 times This is a classic Ben Graham metric. This can be calculated by dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share. Clearly a number of companies will be excluded from any list selected by limiting the target p/e ratio, but who said you needed to own the whole market anyway? The 'margin of safety' investor is more focused, remember, on capital preservation – and owning growth stocks trading on high multiples is also risky, especially when a bull market goes into reverse. The fundamental beauty of a 'margin of safety' approach is that any investor who practises it never has to worry too much about the market turning, since he's primarily defensively positioned in the first place.
 A price / book ratio of less than 1.5x And, ideally, less than 1x. Clearly, this can mean that one sometimes has to be patient. And in some cases, some companies may never trade below book value. But the important thing is that a focus on a low price / book ratio means that the cautious investor never wildly overpays for anything.
 A debt / total assets ratio of less than 30% One of the killers of any company is being overly indebted. Consider poor old Thomas Cook. Here is what seasoned Japan equity analyst John Seagrim wrote as the company crashed some time ago:
 ""For twelve years now Thomas Cook has not only been blithely sending holiday makers abroad with absolutely no tangible balance sheet protection at all, but with an ever growing tangible black hole in its fuselage – in the last 12 years that tangible black hole has widened 8 fold from Minus £413ml to Minus £3.3bn!
 ""I suppose Thomas Cook's thinking was, who needs tangible book when all we do is flog European package holidays to those who don't appear to much like the Europeans, which was sort of fine as long as long as the weather wasn't – last year Thomas Cook cited a 'prolonged period of hot weather' (it's called 'summer') as the reason for their dire 2018 performance.
 ""One could feel sorry for this (in)famous package holiday pedlar, but all sympathy evaporates when one sees the returns package that accompanied their performance.‎ Despite generating a cumulative 12 year Net Loss of £2.685bn – Thomas Cook generously dished out £366ml in dividends and fished out £300ml in buy backs (but then had to ask for most of it back again with a £400ml rights issue 6 years ago), not to mention CEO Fankhauser's generous 'return package' of £8.3ml over the last five years.
 ""The upshot or downshot of this improvidence is that 150,000 stranded Brits now have to be rescued and brought back to BorIsland – an evacuation, the scale of which has not been seen since what was left of the British Expeditionary Force found themselves on the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940.
 ""Call me old fashioned but I don't much care for this capitalism without capital thing, I prefer balance sheets stuffed full of tangible equity not ethereal intangibles like illwill (Thomas Cook has £2.6bn of so called goodwill (in reality 'illwill') on its balance sheet, which until this year gave it an illusorily positive book value). So it's jolly lucky that I do Japan, which is stuffed full of more tangible equity than any other stock market in the world!"" ‎
 (Never hurts to be reminded of the value on offer in Japan!)
 There are three other 'margin of safety' attributes that we like to see in our investee companies:

 Cash from operations growth: We want our companies to be growing. A short-term revenues blip is acceptable in special situations (nobody's perfect), but we like to ride winners, not losers.
 Return on equity of over 8%, on average, per annum, over the prior five years.
 Share buybacks at appropriate valuations.

Somewhere along the line it became fashionable to become deeply hostile towards share buybacks. Once again, it's all a question of valuations.
 If a company's board decides to buy back its stock at close to, or below, book value, it should be encouraged to do so. Warren Buffett does exactly the same thing at Berkshire Hathaway. Buying back stock when it is historically cheap is a perfectly legitimate deployment of corporate capital. Of course, buying back stock when it is outrageously expensive by any traditional metric is a grotesque abuse of your shareholders.
 If we can only get across one aspect of the 'margin of safety' approach, it would be to focus on price above absolutely anything else. Not newsflow, not what the so-called experts in the mainstream media think, and not about arbitrary forecasts that may or may not be wildly inaccurate. (Why is nobody ever held to account for issuing ridiculous forecasts that never come close to reality?)
 At a time when many markets seem egregiously expensive, a focus on 'margin of safety' as the cornerstone of your investment approach should pay huge dividends compared to all those investors pursuing a market-relative approach instead.
 It's not our 'big idea', of course. In terms of practising our craft and learning about the world we're merely following in the footsteps of others. Bernoulli himself deserves a name check (as does Peter L. Bernstein). Along with the likes of Benjamin Graham; Adam Smith; Ludwig von Mises; Richard Feynman; Murray Rothbard; Michael Covel; James Montier; Russell Napier; Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger.
 In any event, as Isaac Newton said in 1675:
 ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."""
2024-09-20,"Title:Tariff Stupidity: Lessons from History
Article:Stupid US history specifically...

 MOST aspects of Bad Economic Nationalism have to do with Tariffs, writes Nathan Lewis on his New World Economics blog.
 Tariffs were a core component of tax systems in the past, whether the Federal Government of the 19th century, or the British government of centuries prior to that. Their important revenue role was largely surpassed by the development of alternative taxes, in particular the Income Tax (1842 in Britain), the Retail Sales Tax, and the VAT.
 You might also include the Payroll Tax, although that is typically conceived as a direct funding mechanism for socialistic programs such as Social Security, rather than as some funding alternative to Tariffs.
 Tariffs have been part of some pretty big disasters over the years, so let's look at what they were.
 In US history, the biggest disasters were the Civil War and Great Depression, both of which had Tariffs as a core component.
 These days, there is a certain group of Southern intellectuals that perhaps want to overstate the importance of Tariffs in the outbreak of the Civil War. Let's be clear: I think the main reason for the Secession of the Southern States, and consequently the Civil War, was not Tariffs, but of course Slavery, in particular the question of the expansion of slavery in new States beyond the original 13 Colonies, that took place in 1789-1860.
 In the original Constitution, a compromise was enacted where importation of new slaves would be eliminated in twenty years, or 1808. At the time of the signing of the Constitution, it was thought that this would lead to the eventual elimination of slavery entirely.
 However, it didn't work out that way. Slavery continued after 1808, and actually expanded in the original Southern States. From 1.2 million slaves in 1810, there were 4.0 million in 1860. Then, the addition of new States also brought with it the expansion of slavery beyond the original Southern Colonies.
 This was a disaster. It led to the creation of the Republican Party to stop it, and Abraham Lincoln as president, who came to prominence in the Lincoln/Douglas debates, regarding slavery in the new States. Not tariffs.
 You can read about it in any decent volume of American History. Since most general books of American history these days are pretty suspect, or are outright garbage, I recommend only two: A History of the American People, by Paul Johnson; and A Patriot's History of the United States, by Schweikart and Allen. Most histories from before 1910 will be good too.
 But tariffs nevertheless played a part in the Civil War. Lincoln's electoral victory was not only a major step forward for blocking the expansion of slavery in the new States, it also made certain the passage of the Morrill Tariff, an increase on tariffs, which was passed in March 1861, immediately upon Lincoln's inauguration.
 Lincoln passed two more Tariff increases during his term, largely to finance the war. After the Southern States seceded and declared themselves independent, there was a sort of standoff. The Southern States naturally didn't want war with the Union if they could avoid it. Peaceful secession worked for them. The Union didn't recognize the secession, but they didn't do much about it, at first.
 The flashpoint, as we know, was an attack at Fort Sumter, in South Carolina.
 Why South Carolina? This was nowhere near the North/South border. Why Fort Sumter? Fort Sumter was a fort built on an artificial island, in the harbor of Charleston. It was a Federal military post, and controlled ship travel through Charleston. One of its purposes was to enforce the collection of Federal tariffs, on trade through Charleston. Since the Federal government didn't recognize Southern secession, naturally it continued to oversee ship trade, including the collection of Federal tariffs.
 Tariffs on manufactured goods mostly advantaged Northern manufacturing interests. They were able to charge higher prices on customers in the South, being protected from lower-cost foreign competition. Southern businesses were mostly engaged in agricultural production (chiefly cotton), which they exported to other countries via harbors such as Charleston.
 The Federal government of course did not charge tariffs on exports. But, other countries, facing Federal tariffs on exports of their goods to the United States, naturally reacted with tariffs on US imports, primarily cotton. A Southern exporter might naturally see a European cotton tariff as a consequence of US import tariffs – especially since the European governments probably stated explicitly this was so.
 It is an exaggeration to say that the Great Depression was caused by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which gained a majority in Congress in September 1929, thus facilitating its passage. By itself, it would have probably led to a recession, but not a Great Depression. But it inspired a worldwide burst of retaliatory tariffs, inflaming a worldwide trade war. In the economic downturn that followed, mostly conservative governments worldwide, facing a falloff in tax revenue, reacted with a burst of domestic spending combined with a burst of higher domestic taxes to pay for it.
 This in turn led to an explosion of monetary chaos with the British devaluation of September 1931, and destructive socialistic attempts to deal with the disaster, such as Roosevelt's National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933.
 What a catastrophe. And, the initial error, that brought to an end the amazing 1920s technological expansion, was Tariff stupidity.
 One reason for the Republicans' embrace of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was the notion that a higher Tariff was good for business. It obviously worked as a protection for US businesses; although customers of those business would likely face higher prices. But, the retaliatory tariffs worldwide were certainly bad for US exporters.
 With Tariffs involved in two of the biggest disasters in US history, and indeed the whole world regretting its tariff warfare and endeavoring, in the World Economic Conference of 1933, to reduce tariffs worldwide and return to something like a pre-1929 status quo, tariffs became the Third Rail of US economic policy and even worldwide economic policy. A trend toward Free Trade began at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 (which included a plan for an International Trade Organization to prevent the kind of retaliatory Trade War that everyone then knew had caused all kinds of problems), and which continued in various forms afterwards.
 To these historic disasters, we can add the day-to-day complexity and difficulty of administering hundreds of tariffs, at different rates. Each tariff, and each rate, became a topic of political contention, not only involving Congress, but also foreign governments and the diplomatic service.
 It was tolerable – arguably – when, in the primitive state of mid-19th century taxation, there didn't seem to be much alternative. But in the 20th century, as tariffs became a negligible revenue source, all this excess complexity and contention became a needless burden, a swamp of difficulty to be avoided via broad Free Trade Agreements, and the like.
 Currency devaluation is not so much a part of the Economic Nationalist agenda today, but it had an important role in the past. We will look at Currency Devaluation as a component of Bad Economic Nationalism soon."
2024-09-18,"Title:Gold Miners 'Cheap' vs. Gold Prices
Article:Record bullion prices leave mining stocks behind...

 For SEASONED gold mining investors, the precious metal's move above $2500 should be a moment of validation, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 After all, the yellow metal has long been seen as the ultimate hedge against economic uncertainty.
 And yet, despite the bull run, gold stocks – those companies that mine, process and sell the metal – are trading at historically low valuations relative to the market.
 
 This apparent disconnect offers contrarian investors an extraordinary opportunity.
 But first, why is this happening? The primary culprit for this disparity, I believe, lies in the impact of interest rates and central banks' gold-buying spree. The real, inflation-protected 10-year Treasury yield rose from a low of around -1.2% in August 2021 to nearly 2.5% in October 2023, and for many investors, particularly those in Western countries, rising yields are a signal to sell non-interest-bearing gold.
 That's exactly what happened. From the end of 2020 to May 2024, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by physical gold shed approximately 30 million ounces, over a quarter of their total holdings, as yield-seeking investors pared back their positions.
 
 What some investors may have overlooked, I'm afraid, is the long-term potential of the very assets they were letting go of.
 Gold stocks, unlike the physical metal, offer not just a hedge but also a means of participating in the upside of gold prices. Put another way, when gold prices have gone up, gold stocks have historically tended to rise even more.
 Right now, I believe these stocks are offering an unprecedented combination of low valuations and high potential returns.
 As contrarians, we understand that the best time to invest is often when sentiment is at its lowest. And sentiment around gold equities is pretty low right now.
 But history tells us that this could be the perfect time to buy. As you may be able to tell in the chart above, we're seeing a reversal of the gold ETF selloff. Since mid-May, investors have added about 2.3 million ounces of gold, according to Bloomberg data; holdings now stand at their highest level since February of this year.
 This could be just the beginning. If real interest fall substantially, the tide could turn in favor of gold and gold equities.
 Historically, gold's biggest gains have occurred when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates amid economic uncertainty. Although there's no obvious crisis on the horizon, markets are pricing in a cut at each of the next three Fed meetings in September, November and December.
 If the Fed follows through, we could see gold prices not only maintain their current levels but soar to new heights. UBS is calling for $2700 gold by mid-2025; Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America all see the metal hitting $3000.
 That's not to say you should dump all your other equities in favor of gold, especially as the Fed is on the verge of easing. Charles Schwab recently showed what stocks did in the past when rates fell, and investors may want to take note.
 The stock market traded up 12 out of 14 times – or 86% of the time – a year after the Fed made its initial cut in a new easing cycle. Schwab points out that the two back-to-back negative periods were predicated on extraordinary circumstances: the dotcom bubble in 2001 and the housing crisis in 2007. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but it's worth considering.

GOLD PRICES just keep on going up to hit new all-time highs, 
            says Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             So whether you're a seller...
           

              
           

             ...hoping that the

             ...or a would-be buyer, wondering if you'll ever see prices go down below today's level once the Fed starts cutting...
           

              
           

             ...it's worth asking again:
           

              
           

             What drives gold prices higher or lower? Why does the stuff go up or down?
           

              
           




              
           

             Step forward big gold-owner the Banque de France with

             Simple. But wrong! Very wrong during gold's current surge up to new all-time highs, in fact.
           

              
           

             Physical demand in the giant jewellery markets of China and India has gone down, as shown by local prices trading at a discount beneath London bullion quotes, deterring new imports.
           

              
           

             Western 
            gold coin demand collapsed in 2023, and it has stayed down through summer and now autumn 2024 as well.
           

              
           

             Gold ETF demand has rallied from the past 2 years' slump, but only really for US-listed trusts...
           

              
           

             ...and very possibly because the No.1 fund, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEArca: GLD), has seen 
            a surge of speculative gold betting in GLD options contracts.
           

              
           

             Those bullish bets that gold is going to continue going up will force banks and brokerages to buy GLD shares, covering their exposure from taking the other side of their clients' wagers. That will lead the GLD to issue more shares, needing more bullion to back them. And since the start of July – as bullion and gold ETF prices have accelerated amid a surge of bullish betting on gold-related derivatives – the GLD has accounted for 84% of net inflows to North American 
            gold ETFs.
           

              
           

             That's sharply greater than the fund's underlying position within that group, where it accounts for 54% by size. GLD inflows are also running sharply ahead of their global weighting, accounting for a massive 42% of gold ETF growth worldwide over the past 11 weeks while accounting for only 27% of the sector's size overall.
           

              
           

             As for BullionVault...
           

              
           

             ...the world's largest marketplace for private investors to trade and own securely stored precious metals...
           

              
           

             ...users continue to 
            take profit net-net, seizing on gold's latest record-high prices to bank some or more of their gains and edge down the quantity of gold they own in specialist vaults in London, New York, Singapore, Toronto and Zurich.
           

              
           

             And why not? The value of those holdings, after all, keeps going up to new records, now rising above $3.6 billion thanks to gold's bull market.
           

              
           

             This isn't new however. Gold buying across the world often retreats in the face of rising gold prices. You can see this clearly on the very best data available, so long as you exclude 
            the 'OTC' figure which not only covers 'unreported' (and ultimately unknowable) transactions in the global market for large vaulted bars but which also plugs any gap between visible demand and supply from mining and scrap recycling.
           

              
           

             That leaves you looking at jewellery demand, coins and small bars, technological use, and central bank buying or selling overall. This chart uses 
            estimates published by the mining industry's World Gold Council. For 
            central-bank holdings and demand those estimates repeatedly outweigh the official data reported by central bank reserve managers in public.
           

              
           




              
           

             As you can see, gold demand overall has plainly moved down as prices move up during the big surge of 2024 to date. That split was more remarkable still during the Covid Crisis starting a little under 5 years ago.
           

              
           

             So, Banque de France, want to try again?
           

              
           

             ""The price of gold,"" says the French central bank, taking another stab at identifying gold's price drivers in its new report, ""is a function of US interest rates and inflation...
           

              
           

             ""...as well as risk aversion.""
           

              
           

             Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
           

              
           

             We'll come back to 'risk aversion' in moment. Because first, gold pays no income or interest. So it becomes less appealing when interest rates rise. Because cash in the bank grows more attractive.
           

              
           

             Hence the historic pattern of gold tending to rise in price when the returns to cash in the bank start falling.
           

              
           

             In fact, over the past 7 rate-cutting cycles from the US Fed, the price of gold has traded higher 6 months after the Fed's first cut on all but one occasion...
           

              
           

             ...giving gold owners an average 7.9% gain in Dollar terms, as Atsuko Whitehouse here at BullionVault noted in 
            Monday's London gold market report. 
           

              
           

             But further out, what really counts (or so analysts now including the Banque de France agree) is the real rate of interest, after you allow for the pace of inflation.
           

              
           

             Why? It's because high interest rates aren't worth much if inflation also runs high. Cash in the bank might in fact be costing you real value!
           

              
           

             Gold, in contrast, cannot be inflated in supply (unlike cash or bonds). Nor can it ever go broke (unlike a bank or a borrower). The stuff does so little, remember, that it can't even rust.
           

              
           

             In finance speak, this makes gold ""a long-duration durable asset"" as analysts at US central bank the Federal Reserve's Chicago division called gold a couple of years ago.
           

              
           

             And given that gold pays you nothing (""a relatively stable dividend yield"" 
            according to the Chicago Fed, apparently unable to use 1 simple word when 5 confusing words will do) this means that the price of gold ""is expected to have a strong inverse relationship with the long-term real interest rate.""
           

              
           

             Correct! Well, most of the time. Very true in the 1970s and true again across most of the 21st Century to date...
           

              
           




              
           

             But check out the mid-1980s and 1990s, plus the past couple of years.
           

              
           

             Gold instead went in the same direction as real yields on longer-term bonds...
           

              
           

             ...defying the pattern which analysts and traders would otherwise like to set their watch by.
           

              
           

             Between 1984 and the start of the year 2001, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield fell from 7.4% per annum above the pace of inflation to just 1.4% above it.
           

              
           

             That made longer-term debt much less attractive to new buyers. Yet instead of giving investors a reason to buy bullion, the real price of gold also fell, dropping (in terms of today's US Dollar) from $1150 per ounce to just $475.
           

              
           

             The same thing has happened over the past 2.5 years, only in reverse and much more briefly (so far).
           

              
           

             Back in February 2022, the real yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds was minus 6.4%. It shot over 7 percentage points higher to reach plus 1.3% at the end of August 2024. But the real gold price also jumped, rising from an inflation-adjusted $2100 to the current figure of very nearly $2600 per ounce.
           

              
           

             What gives?
           

              
           

             ""Risk aversion,"" says the Banque de France.
           

              
           

             ""Generally speaking, risk appetite is negatively correlated with gold"" when times are good...
           

              
           

             ...because ""investors favour exposure to risky assets such as equities and corporate bonds over defensive assets like cash, government bonds and gold.""
           

              
           

             Hence the breakdown in gold's inverse movement against bond yields in the 1980s and '90s. Stock markets were soaring, and real estate too, as the West won the Cold War and peace broke out everywhere that US and other Nato troops landed or bombed.
           

              
           

             Hence the breakdown in the past 2 years as well, but in the other direction, with gold rising even as real yields have leapt. 
           

              
           

             ""This appears to have been driven mainly by emerging market central bank buying,"" says the BdF. The rising gold price has been ""justified by investors buying for non-financial reasons, motivated by geopolitical tensions"" amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine...
           

              
           

             ...the Western sanctions in response...
           

              
           

             ...and then the Hamas attack on Israel last October, followed by Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza...
           

              
           

             ...plus the growing tensions and risk of region-wide conflict in the South China Sea on top.
           

              
           

             But while central-bank gold buying has jumped, this driver of the gold price was already at half-century highs ahead of the Covid pandemic. It also contrasts with the lack of ""risk aversion"" gold demand among private-sector investors across the last couple of years. Because risk aversion, like gold investment demand outside central banks, has gone missing.
           

              
           




              
           

             Look, I'm getting almost as tired of showing you this chart as you are of seeing it.
           

              
           

             But fact is, 
            gold and the stock market have rarely been more closely correlated than they are today. And gold isn't alone.
           

              
           

             ""Exchange-traded funds tracking government debt, corporate credit and equities have now risen in unison for four straight months,"" says 
            Fortune magazine, ""the 
            longest stretch of correlated gains since at least 2007.""
           

              
           

             As for the US stock market itself, the S&P500 index has now gained 25% in the past 12 months. It ""has never climbed this much in the run-up to the first interest-rate cut of an easing cycle"" says analysis of 7 decades of data compiled by Ned Davis Research and Bloomberg.
           

              
           

             ""Fed's rate decision will rock markets,"" says a headline elsewhere.
           

              
           

             ""Fed rate cuts could boost stocks, or sink them,"" says another...
           

              
           

             ...helping investors decide what to do almost as badly as this article about what drives gold prices higher or lower!
           

              
           

             Eyes down for Wednesday's Fed decision then. More importantly, watch the updated 'dot plot' forecasts for where the US central bank's policymakers believe growth, inflation and the interest rates they themselves set will head in future.
           

              
           

             Because if risk aversion is to return among private investors – boosting their gold demand while emerging-market central banks keep buying too – any hint of economic doubts from the Fed might finally give stock-market bulls reasons to worry that the S&P looks fragile.
           

              
           

             Gold, in contrast, doesn't even rust."
2024-09-16,"Title:Gold Stocks: Not Yet Unique
Article:Wait for it, wait for it...

 MANY gold stock traders will hold for the wrong reasons, sell for the wrong reasons, and not buy back for the right reasons, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 It is one of the most interesting aspects of precious metals investing/trading. This 'buy/sell for the wrong reasons' phenomenon. Many years ago I came up with the graphic below to illustrate how advisers, analysts and their herds focus on the wrong reasons for being bullish on gold miners.
 Re-enter the Macrocosm...
 
 ...our rough guide to what is and what is not so important to the fundamental gold mining case.
 See those tiny planets (China/India love trades and especially, cyclical inflation)? They are tiny for a reason and that reason is that they are bullshit, where supposed fundamentals are concerned.
 What I call ""cyclical inflation"" – that is, inflationary macro management by monetary authorities that at least temporarily works to benefit the economy – and the China/India buying promos have been ineffective themes at best, and disastrous at worst, for gold stock traders who believe in them, since 2008.
 As belabored for many years, it is counter-cyclicality and deflationary pressure that will drive gold's ""real"" price (measured against commodities, stocks, CPI, etc) up hard, even if its nominal price remains under wraps. That will be the real monetary value asset retaining value as its relative price gets marked up within a failing macro.
 That, in turn, will expand the margins of gold mining operations, all other things being equal. Gold/Energy, Gold/Materials, Gold/Humans, etc. As gold's ratios to other assets and markets expand, so does the bottom line potential of a gold miner.
 For much of the last two decades, the above-noted dynamics only came into play during asset market bears and/or crashes (eg, 2000, 2008, 2020) before the deflationary situation was quickly mopped up by people like our nation's ""hero"" Ben Bernanke, circa 2008-2009...
 It was truly heroic – if long-term damaging to the system – as the bull market in stocks birthed by a steroidal policy panic begun in 2008, endures to this day.
 Do we have proper gold mining fundamentals in line today? Well, gold's ratios to cyclical markets are grinding into place quite nicely. The monetary metal is firmly trending up vs. commodities per this weekly chart.
 
 That feeds what I call gold mining ""sector"" fundamentals. However, there is a vulnerability in gold stocks to a future broad stock market bear, as there is not yet a definitive change in trend vs. stock markets and the miners are merely among the leaders of a wider rally, including many highly speculative asset markets.
 The gold miners are not yet unique. And that is okay, for now. But there is likely to be a ""SELL"" call on the sector at some possibly much higher level than today's.
 That will be due to broad market correlation and vulnerability. Recall gold stock traders puking en mass, leading the market crash in 2008 because ""failing inflation!!"", because ""deflation!"", because ""OMG, gold is dropping!""
 But in relation to cyclical and inflation-sensitive markets gold rammed higher during the last two deflationary episodes, in 2008 and 2020. Those were times to buy, as mining stocks crashed.
 You can bet that inflation-centric gold bugs were puking out because...""OMG, no INFLATION!""
 
 A future long-term bull market may result from the lack of future 'unsuccessful' inflation operations (unlike the 2004-2022 period). But again, first comes the ""vulnerability"" theme, after whatever highs are made on the current bull leg (we manage upside targets and interim caution/opportunity points reliably and effectively each week in NFTRH).
 The ""macro"" fundamentals, which will influence mainstream investors when gold reasserts vs. stock markets, are still in progress, baking in the oven. The above-noted ""sector"" fundamentals are doing quite well, as gold handily out-performs cyclical commodities, including gold mining cost drivers.
 The fundamental situation is positive now, and will improve after stocks (likely including gold mining stocks) top out. Then will come the longer bull market that could run through the rest of the decade (just riffing here).
 The crux of our current big picture macro theme is that the implications of a broken macro, per the 30yr Treasury Yield (Continuum's) broken long-term trend, is that our policy heroes may and probably will try to effectively reflate the system, but due to saturation of the bond market (the Fed's decades-long management/manipulation tool), the results will not be the same happy ones that the Hero above was able to provide.
 There is a rebellion by the carriers of the massive debt of the USA and it will impair a formerly all-powerful Fed's ability to control things at will on future down cycles. This was the old way...
  The Outer Limits, adjusted for today by Notes from the Rabbit Hole
 ...but ineffective battles against both deflation and inflation, a veritable pulling back of the curtain of invincibility, may be the new way.
 As to the Continuum, the trend is broken, but ""yields are declining now"", you say? Yes, and right on schedule per our analysis of a disinflationary (Goldilocks) to deflationary macro swing we have been managing for nearly 2 years now. The implications of the Continuum's trend break would come into play after this pullback to test the breakout plays out (targeting the 3.3% area).
 So I am talking my book and as NFTRH subscribers know, that book calls for this easing of inflationary pressures in the current phase, but also future policy constraints when it is time for whatever ""Hero"" is in charge to spring into action against deflation.
 
 For several reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, I expect a tragic ending to the stock market arm of the ""Everything Bubble"" instigated by hyper-easy policy. Anything correlated positively with it is likely to be vulnerable when the machines, quants and multitudes of wise guys start selling in unison, just as they buy in unison today.
 Oh, and don't forget the margin man. He will want his due, and he won't care what you have to liquidate to get it.
 But on the big picture, the much bemoaned HUI/Gold ratio (HGR) as been a righteous indicator of a generally poor gold mining fundamental backdrop.
 
 Its 20-year decline was logical, and you should not let belly aching and excuse making influence you otherwise. But thus far the gold mining rally is valid by this important internal indicator. I expect the HGR to continue leading into whatever top is out ahead. Longer-term, after a deflationary liquidation clears the macro, a new bull market in this internal indicator may even ensue.
 Consider joining NFTRH, which has been right on the mark since effectively managing the 2020 crash, the inflationary recovery from that crash, and most recently managing the ""new macro"" picture and the current Goldilocks/disinflation situation within it.
 Actually, on the big picture we've been in step with the markets analytically, since inception right into the jaws of the oncoming market crash in Q4 2008.
 One thing is for sure. We need to manage modern markets with an independent mindset and not follow stale and debunked theories about why the gold stock sector ""should have been"" bullish. The HUI/Gold ratio was not wrong. It was very right. If your assumptions are wrong, then your entire analytical framework is built on an error.
 And the assumption that cyclical inflation was going to bull gold stocks was a pervasive, destructive and ongoing error.
 The current trade is already quite profitable, but when it ends it will likely end in rude fashion, if current trends and market correlations remain intact. Then, amid deflationary fears upon the macro, the average gold stock trader will not be buying the destruction. But that will be the time to position for a longer-term bull phase. That could be years out from here.
 Meanwhile, let's enjoy the current trade, but also understand it for what it is, a cyclical bull phase against improving fundamentals with one nagging issue, a currently positive correlation to high risk cyclical markets (again, to talk my book, I have several positions in those markets as well, as we manage the perhaps final stages of the broad bull)."
2024-09-14,"Title:US Recession Warnings Multiply
Article:Fed rate cuts can't start soon enough...

 The U.S. ECONOMY could be heading into choppy waters, and investors may be wise to buckle up, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Recent data suggest that storm clouds could be gathering, with declines in US manufacturing, a softening labor market and worrisome signs from the bond market all pointing to possible trouble ahead.
 Manufacturing production signaled a significant weakening in demand in August. The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI posted a reading of 47.9, its lowest level in 2024 so far. Any PMI below 50 indicates contraction, and this is now the second consecutive month of declines.
 Weakness in manufacturing isn't just a concern for the stock market. The industry is contracting at a time when Kamala Harris, the incumbent-party presidential candidate, is hoping to run on the administration's economic success.
 
 If Harris takes office at a time when the business cycle is faltering, she'll face an uphill battle with a slowing jobs market, lagging home sales and a Federal Reserve caught between a rock and a hard place on interest rates. Geopolitical risks also continue to swirl in the background, creating even more uncertainty.
 But the US isn't alone in this struggle. In August, the J.P.Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5, an eight-month low. Out of 31 countries surveyed, 18 showed deterioration in manufacturing conditions, including those in the euro area and Japan. The slowdown isn't confined to our shores – it's a global issue that could have ripple effects on trade, jobs and investment opportunities.
 The US labor market has long been a source of strength for the economy, but it, too, is starting to send worrying signals. August's jobs report was underwhelming, and while the unemployment rate is still relatively low, the trend is going in the wrong direction.
 In July, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, which triggered what's known as the Sahm rule, a little-known but highly accurate recession indicator named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm. The rule has successfully predicted every US recession since 1970, so when it's activated, people take notice.
 Payroll gains have also slowed over the past several months, and many economists expect that we'll see downward revisions in the number of jobs added. All of this is happening as inflation remains a persistent thorn in the side of policymakers, complicating the Fed's job as it tries to balance controlling prices with avoiding a deeper slowdown in the economy.
 Sahm herself has expressed concern that the Fed might not be acting quickly enough to avoid a recession. ""The Fed can no longer afford to move gradually,"" she said recently in an interview with Goldman Sachs. ""Twenty-five basis point cuts would probably suffice to avoid the worst possible economic outcomes, but these cuts have to be delivered decisively, not gradually.""
 One of the most reliable recession indicators over the last 50 years has been the yield curve, and last week, it turned positive again for the first time in over two years. An inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, has preceded every US recession since the 1970s. This occurs because market participants, anticipating future rate cuts to combat a downturn, drive long-term rates lower.
 Typically, the spread between the 10-year and two-year Treasury notes is used to gauge this inversion. Before last week, the yield curve had been inverted for a staggering 783 consecutive days, the longest such period in US history. Although the inversion has recently ""uninverted"", meaning long-term rates are no longer lower than short-term rates, the damage may already be done.
 
 Historically, there's been about a 12-month lag on average between the first inversion and the onset of a recession. But this can vary. For instance, the curve first inverted in January 2006, roughly two years before the financial crisis began in 2008. If history is any guide, the prolonged inversion we just experienced could be setting the stage for another economic downturn.
 What does all this mean for investors? According to Peter Berezin, Director of Research at BCA, it may be time to rethink your portfolio strategy. Writing in the Financial Times, Berezin says that now may be the moment to rotate out of stocks and into bonds. For the last two years, stocks have been the place to be, but with a recession potentially on its way, Berezin believes bonds will soon offer a better risk-reward balance.
 In a recessionary scenario, Berezin expects the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio to fall from 21 to 16, with earnings estimates dropping by 10%. This would bring the S&P down to 3,800 – an almost 30% decline from current levels. It's a sobering prediction, but one that can't be ignored, especially given the headwinds facing the global economy.
 The Federal Reserve has been in a rate-hiking cycle for over two years now, but with economic data weakening, many expect that rate cuts are on the horizon. The first cut is anticipated to come at the September 17-18 FOMC meeting, with a reduction of 0.25% to 0.50%. While some might hope that this will stave off a recession, it's important to remember that rate cuts take time to filter through the economy.
 There's also the risk that the Fed could be too slow in its actions. Sahm, Berezin and others argue that decisive cuts may be necessary to avoid the worst outcomes. The longer the Fed waits, the harder it will be to reverse the course of a slowing economy.
 As always, I remain optimistic about the long-term potential of the US economy, but the short-term outlook is uncertain. Now may be the time to reexamine your portfolio and prepare for the possibility of a slowdown. History shows that recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle, but they can also present opportunities for savvy investors who are prepared.
 Stay focused, stay informed and as always, happy investing!"
2024-09-12,"Title:US Election: The Debate That Wasn't
Article:Inflation, debt, Ukraine: What Trump and Harris almost said...

 DONALD TRUMP and Kamala Harris stood before the American people...and debated, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 In an alternate reality, here is what transcribed.
 MODERATOR: Mr.Trump, before the pandemic you were spending record amounts of money and running up the national debt. Explain yourself.
 DONALD TRUMP: I never said I was Paul Ryan. I was a Democrat from New York City for most of my life. I found an issue that resonated with minions of Americans. That was immigration and the wall. That's what got me elected. I was as surprised as you were, buh-lieve me. Anyway, you don't get elected promising spending cuts.
 Moderator: You also said you're a low interest rate guy. Does that mean you want the Fed to artificially suppress interest rates?
 Trump: If it helps me get re-elected, of course. Why wouldn't I? Plus, I'm a real estate guy, the best real estate guy. An amazing real estate guy, the greatest. And low interest rates are good for business, so yes.
 Moderator: Thank you, Mr.Trump.
 Vice President Harris, before 2020, the federal government never spent more than $4.4 trillion in any year. Under your administration, the government never spent less than $6 trillion and the outgoing President, whose nomination you stole – sorry, were awarded – proposed a $7.3 trillion budget for 2025.
 Will you continue these spending levels?
 KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you for the question. Yes, of course I will spend as much as Joe Biden, if not more. I'm a Democrat after all. I mean, that's what we do, right? [Cackling, head shaking side to side, hands thrown in the air.] We spend a lot of money. And the more, the better. We just call it investing in America, that's all. And people fall for it.
 Moderator: But look at all the inflation we've experienced under your administration. Don't you think that massive amount of spending fueled that inflation?
 Harris: No. You see, we passed something called the Inflation Reduction Act. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, and inflation was reduced. OK? Voila! [More cackling, more head-shaking, more hand-waving.] We refused to be unburdened by what has been.
 Moderator: It's funny you mention that, Ms.Vice President. Just the other day Joe Biden admitted that the Inflation Reduction Act had nothing to do with reducing inflation and that the administration should have been honest about that and said what it really was. How do you respond to that?
 Harris: Well, Joe had a senior moment. He had a senior moment. He accidentally let the truth out, which is exactly why he had to go. You just never know when he's going to slip up. So that's what happened.
 Moderator: So how long did you know that Biden was mentally unfit to remain in office?
 Harris: J-o-e B-i-d-e-n...is a great president who has done enormous good for the country. OK? We should all thank him for his incredible public service. All of us.
 Moderator: Thank you, Ms.Vice President. I think.
 Mr.Trump, you want to impose high tariffs on foreign goods, especially from China. Almost all economists agree that high tariffs end up hurting the people they're supposed to help because they make goods more expensive. How do you respond to that?
 Trump: In my first term, we had the best economy ever. Everyone agrees, it was unbelievable. Unbelievable. We brought manufacturing jobs home. She wants to ship them all to...CHINA.
 Moderator: But Mr.Trump, the record is clear. The US lost manufacturing jobs on your watch. And the trade deficit, which should have decreased if your policies worked, actually increased. How do you explain that?
 Trump: Fake news. It's fake news, that's all. Everybody knows it, and you should be ashamed of yourself for repeating it. Really, you should.
 Moderator: Ms.Vice President, you've released specific economic proposals you say will help the American people. Much of it involves taxing the wealthy to subsidize the middle and lower classes. Do you think the wealthy will take it or find clever ways to hide their money from you? They have very clever accountants. Please explain yourself.
 Harris: Look, the most popular thing a politician can do is promise to go after the wealthy. OK? Who cares if it actually works? I-t d-o-e-s-n'-t m-a-t-t-e-r. I just have to get elected.
 Moderator: Ms.Vice President, you were considered the most liberal senator, even more so than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. How do you plan on selling your extreme record to the American people?
 Harris: Listen. Have you been listening to me? I'm coming across as a moderate. A moderate. I mean, if you listen to me speak, you'd think I was a Republican like George W. Bush or John McCain. [Cackling again, in disbelief that the American people could fall for it.]
 Trump: You're a LIAR.
 Moderator: Please, Mr.Trump, do not interrupt. Please wait your turn.
 Trump: But she is! She's Kama Kama Kama Kama Chameleon. That's my new name for her. Isn't it great? It's so true. So true. She is, you know.
 Moderator: Mr.Trump, please follow the rules or I'll have no choice but to cut off your microphone.
 Now turning to you, Mr.Trump, do you want Ukraine to win its war with Russia?
 Trump: Who cares who wins? Who cares? Putin's a tough guy. Really tough guy. But I told him that I'd hit Moscow hard if he pissed me off. And they call me a Putin stooge! I threaten to hit him hard and they call me a Putin stooge. Can you believe it? The whole Russiagate thing was a hoax. It's disgraceful. Absolutely disgraceful. I'm still waiting for an apology from you, by the way.
 Moderator: Mr.Trump, you've criticized Vice President Harris for risking nuclear war with Russia. By threatening to hit Moscow hard, aren't you risking the same thing?
 Trump: You've gotta be tough! You've gotta be tough with these people. I know these people. I've dealt with Putin. I've dealt with Xi. I've dealt with...Rocket Man. OK? You've gotta be tough with these people. Real tough.
 Moderator: Ms.Vice President, you've pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to help Ukraine defeat Russia. Is there any limit to what you'd be willing to do to defeat Russia?
 Harris: We must stand together against Russian aggression and to preserve democracy in Ukraine. That's who we are. That's what we do.
 Trump: You don't even support democracy at home. You threw away the votes of 14 minion people who voted for Joe. If you believed in democracy you would have had an open convention in Chicago last month. Whoever got the most delegates would have won the nomination. But no, they installed you. And they say I'm a threat to democracy! Are you kidding? I mean, really.
 Moderator: That's it, Mr.Trump. You've been warned. I'm turning off your microphone. (Trump continues speaking, inaudibly, visibly disturbed.) Please continue, Ms.Vice President.
 Harris: If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine, he won't stop there. He'll take Poland next, then the Baltic states. Who knows, he might even take Vladivostok. I mean Vladimir, Vladivostok. Get it? [Once again cackling and gesticulating.]
 Moderator: Ms.Vice President, are you willing to go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine?
 Harris: We will do...whatever it takes. OK? Whatever it takes.
 Moderator: Including nuclear war?
 Harris: [Once again cackling, only more intensely.] As FDR said – or was it JFK – LBJ? We will bear any burden. That's right, we will bear any burden. We will not be burdened...by what has been. OK? We won't be.
 Moderator: Mr.Trump, do you have anything to say in conclusion? No? Good, thank you for appearing here tonight. [Trump shrieks into a muted microphone, desperate, face turning increasingly red.]
 Moderator: Vice President Harris, do you have a concluding statement?
 Harris: We can only conclude where we began.
 Moderator: And that is?
 Harris: Wherever...we began. Wherever we began. Wherever that was. [More cackling, more hand movements.]
 Moderator: Thank you very much, Ms.Vice President. Good night, ladies and gentlemen."
2024-09-10,"Title:Joined at the Hip? Gold's Correlation with S&P500 Hits 4-Decade High
Article:Price of gold and US stocks set new all-time highs ahead of the Fed...


              
           


The PRICE of GOLD is famously uncorrelated with the stock market, offering investors a simple way to diversify an equity portfolio by adding a little bullion to help spread their risk, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             But that non-correlation – meaning that gold shows no relationship with the stock market, moving neither together with nor against the direction of equity prices over longer time frames – only works as an average. 
           

              
           

             At any point in time, gold tends to be either negatively correlated against the direction of equity prices – a 
            negative gold correlation often seen when the stock market slumps – or positively correlated with it. And at the start of September, the price of gold in US Dollars was more positively correlated with the US stock market than almost any time in 4 decades on a 1-month basis, and more closely connected on a 1-year basis than any time since spring 2011.
           

              
           

             Here comes the science...!
           

              
           




              
           

             Measured on the 'r' coefficient of day-to-day movements over a 1-month period, gold began September with a correlation of +0.945 against the S&P500 index.
           

              
           

             This was the most positive 1-month relationship since February 2010 (when it read +0.947) and close to the strongest link since September 1982 (+0.966). That number would read +1.000 if gold and the stock market were moving absolutely in lock-step with each other, or minus 1.000 if they moved exactly opposite day by day. Over the past half-a-century, the 1-month correlation has averaged +0.004.
           

              
           

             Gold has also become extremely correlated with US stocks on a 12-month basis, with that 'r' coefficient reaching +0.897. That's close to the top 1% of all 365-day readings over the past half-a-century, and it's the most positive connection since mid-May 2011.
           

              
           

             Again, this longer-term relationship averages near to zero (+0.020 since 1969). So gold and the stock market will need to diverge at some point, to help the long-term average remain close to zero.
           

              
           

             This is already happening on the 1-month correlation of gold and the stock market, and it fell to +0.693 at the start of this week. But the 1-year relationship is less volatile, and correlations as extreme or stronger than today have a tendency to run for extended periods of time...
           

              
           

             ...34 trading days in a row in spring 2010, for instance, or 25 days in spring 2004 and 67 days in mid-1971.
           

              
           




              
           

             So far in autumn 2024, it has run this high for only 9 trading days in a row so far. So for better or for worse, next week's Federal Reserve decision and forecast for US interest rates will very likely see the underlying direction of gold and the stock market remain joined at the hip for a few more days if not months to come.
           

              
           

             Of course, both equities and the price of gold have since last summer shrugged off the highest interest rates in two decades. They have now jumped to new all-time highs in anticipation of the Fed finally joining New Zealand, Canada, the ECB and Bank of England in starting to cut the cost of borrowing from next week. But while a quarter-point cut is now the consensus prediction for the Fed's September decision, both assets could suffer a pullback if the US central bank's new forecasts for how deeply it will cut rates by Christmas and in 2025 then disappoint market expectations.
           

              
           

             Those expectations currently foresee the Fed's key interest rate standing at 4.3% by the end of 2024 and just 2.9% by end-2025. But the central bank's policy team itself forecast 5.1% and 4.1% in their June 'dot plots', raising both predictions from the outlook they gave in March at 4.6% and 3.9%.
           

              
           

             So there's scope for disappointment in both the stock market and gold around next Wednesday's new Fed forecasts. Not least because everyone – and I mean everyone in gold-market analysis and punditry – is now 
            shout-out-loud bullish gold because of the Fed rate cut now guaranteed to arrive on 18 September.
           

              
           

             But beyond that? Any pullback is likely to find a warm welcome among private investors, offsetting 
            the caution in gold demand caused by the past year's mix of high prices and high interest rates. And for anyone trying to balance risk and growth across a spread of different investments, it would offer a chance to buy gold as a hedge against longer-term falls in the stock market – a scenario looking increasingly possible as weaker US jobs data plus the 
            shifting US yield curve points towards an economic recession."

WHAT a summer! 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault in notes first shared with BullionVault users reading Monday's Weekly Update
             email.


              
           

             Japan raised rates above zero, riots hit England, Ukraine took the war to Russia, one would-be US president promised price controls, another dodged a bullet...
           

              
           

             ...France went far right then far left, Germany went both ways at once, the UK got a new government with just 1-in-3 votes...
           

              
           

             ...the Fed vowed to start cutting US interest rates, the Middle East delayed (but didn't defuse) all-out war between Israel and Iran...
           

              
           

             ...and inflation slowed a bit further from its post-Covid surge worldwide while chip giant Nvidia's earnings beat everyone's expectations but not as much as everyone expected.
           

              
           

             Financial impact?
           

              
           

             A brief 
            stock-market slump (and a crash in Tokyo) followed by new all-time highs in developed-world equities as traders bet yet again (only harder) that the US Fed will slash the cost of borrowing Dollars, starting 2 weeks from now.
           

              
           

             Oh, and so the inverted yield curve on US Treasury bonds...
           

              
           

             ...which had been 
            screaming ""Recession coming!"" for a record stretch by putting 2-year rates above 10-year rates...
           

              
           

             ...finally got back to zero and 
            said that its warning is over.
           

              
           

             Gulp! It's the steepening which hurts, remember. Most of all the jobless rate.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Gold tends to do well in absolute and relative terms during US recessions,"" 
            found a study by James Luke at UK fund managers Schroders in January 2023, noting 19 months ago that ""financial markets have been [already] anticipating a US recession for some time"" thanks to a ""clear signal"" from the inverted US yield curve.
           

              
           

             ""Gold has been excellent at offsetting stock losses during recessions,"" 
            agreed a separate study from Ronald-Peter Stoeferle of Liechtenstein-based wealth managers Incrementum in May 2019, claiming 6 months before anyone got a Covid cough that ""recession risks [were already] significantly higher than discounted by the market.""
           

              
           

             ""Gold prices can act as an indicator of the health of the economy,"" said 
            a 'Beyond the Numbers' article from the US government's Bureau of Labor Statistics in February 2013...
           

              
           

             ...eve of gold's steepest price crash in 3 decades.
           

              
           

             ""A rise in the price of gold may be a signal that the economy is struggling. As a result, in times of either a crisis or inflation, many investors turn to gold to protect their principal.""
           

              
           

             Whether we now face recession or not, gold at a glance says things really look bad. Stocks in contrast say the opposite. They can't both be right, not unless the whole things has just become about when and how deep the US Federal Reserve will slash the cost of borrowing.
           

              
           

             But while it's been a violent, doom-laden and cynical summer in the wider financial and geopolitical headlines, at least gold analysts, traders and investors are seeing things start to normalize.
           

              
           

 Bullion prices set fresh all-time highs as US interest-rate expectations fell with the Dollar;
 Western gold ETFs and speculative betting finally rose together with prices;
 Asia's giant consumer markets in contrast turned cautious, edging prices in both China and India back to a discount versus the global gold price's new records.


              
           

             After the broken correlations of 2024's first half, all this flips gold's recent patterns on their head as summer ends and the nights draw in. Because the market has reverted to the long-time connections which you could set your watch by...
           

              
           

             ...and it's reverted just 
            as everyone says ""
            China now rules!"" rather than Western investment flows.
           

              
           

             Hell, we've 
            even got financial journalists snickering about 
            'Gold is just a pet rock' again!
           

              
           

             ""Gold is only worth what it's worth because people think it's worth that much,"" 
            declares one podcaster at the 
            Financial Times.
           

              
           

             Such disdain, it's like a welcome home hug! Bringing biscuits and tea in your favourite mug, let's start with real rates.
           

              
           




              
           

             Because gold pays no yield but is widely viewed as inflation proof, its price typically shows a strongly negative relationship with the direction of real interest rates.
           

              
           

             To track this, analysts and traders tend to look at the yield offered by 10-year US inflation-protected Treasury bonds. And its correlation with gold…
           

              
           

             …after defying the laws of nature and showing the most positive connection in almost 2 decades this spring…
           

              
           

             …is now back into deeply negative territory, meaning that gold prices have been going in the opposite direction to real rates once more…
           

              
           

             (...or going in the same direction if you flip the gold price axis upside-down like our chart does above, hopefully to show the connection more clearly).
           

              
           

To repeat: This return to opposite paths comes after gold's link with TIPS yields upended the usual pattern. It had already skipped a beat when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and inflation rose to 4-decade highs. Gold prices rose and then held firm even as real interest rates shot higher in anticipation of the US Fed (and other central banks) trying to tackle inflation by finally raising the cost of borrowing faster than the cost of living.
           

              
           

             Earlier this year, the underlying link snapped again, only more so, with the 1-month average of the 1-month r-correlation coefficient nearing its most positive since gold's price surge of spring 2006, rising even as the real cost of borrowing and the real returns to cash and bonds went higher.
           

              
           

             We looked when it mattered at 
            why this TIPS-gold correlation broke down. So here in autumn 2024, why normalize now?
           

              
           

             Well, like the TIPS-gold correlation, Western investing flows have also returned to gold after going absent without leave for most of the past 3 years.
           

              
           

             Gold's big surges of late-2023 and spring 2024 came even as Western investment flows went negative, defying 
            another long-standing basic of how the gold market works.
           

              
           

             But these latest highs above $2500...? The giant GLD trust fund loved it. Hot-money betting on Comex futures and options loved it more.
           

              
           




              
           

Take note: Coin and small-bar sales remain dire in Europe and North America. Profit-taking has also continued in securely-stored gold owned outright...
           

              
           

             ...but at a very moderate pace given where prices are trading. And new account openings on BullionVault jumped by 45% in August from the previous 12-month average...
           

              
           

             ...showing that there's strong pent-up Western investor demand ready to seize on pullbacks in the price of physical gold if not wanting to join the bull market at new higher prices.
           

              
           

             More broadly, and as a proxy for wealth management flows, analysts and traders wanting to gauge the size of Western gold investing usually add the size of gold-backed ETF trust funds to the level of bullish betting by speculative traders in US futures and options contracts.
           

              
           

             Long term, those 2 added together show a statistically strong correlation against the gold price...
           

              
           

             ...a 12-month r-squared of 66.9% no less.
           

              
           

             It would read 100% if they moved absolutely in lock-step. It sank to a historic low of 0.1% in February this year, but it has now rebounded to a statistically significant 58.9%. And within the trust fund segment, 
            gold ETF inflows have flipped away from Asia-listed products...
           

              
           

             ...where investors have suddenly become net sellers as a group...
           

              
           

             ...back to Western markets, where demand has been positive in 10 of the past 13 weeks, led by the US, UK and France.
           

              
           




              
           

             Asia's gold consumer demand has also reverted to type this summer, taking fright at gold's new record-high prices after driving it up to a big run of new highs in the first-half of 2024.
           

              
           

             Household and investor demand in China has sunk in the face of the precious metal's latest gains, most especially for jewellery. This means Shanghai prices have now been trading below London quotes for 2 weeks running, the longest stretch of discounts since summer 2021.
           

              
           

             Gold prices in No.2 consumer India have also gone back to a discount versus global quotes after briefly turning positive in July. Again that suggests softer demand, but 
            July's surprise (and large) cut to India's gold import duty in the BJP's post-election budget is likely to boost wedding and Diwali festival demand this autumn.
           

              
           

             Dealers, retailers and shareholders in India's big listed jewellery firms agree that, even at record high prices...and even with the Rupee near record lows on the FX market...gold will find eager buyers in the world's fastest-growing major economy now that the Modi government has halved total tax costs for gold consumers from 18% to 9%.
           

              
           

             Finally, central banks. Like China's private-sector demand in the 12 months to June, official reserves managers as a group broke with their typically price-sensitive behaviour in the past few years...buying more gold even as prices rose to new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Led by China and other emerging-market nations, this demand helped support and boost prices even as Western investment went AWOL. But while the Reserve Bank of India has continued to accumulate bullion, China has reported no additions since April, snapping what had become an 18-month programme of buying at any price. At the same time, official data show Mexico, Kazakhstan and most dramatically Singapore and Turkey taking profit, leading to the first net selling in more than 12 months in June.
           

              
           
 So the outlook for gold investment now?

              
           

             First, the return of regular service...like the end of the inverted US yield curve...remains young and uncertain so far, and it could prove brief.
           

              
           

             The previous break in what drives gold higher might yet return and become the new normal, making China the key driver for gold prices rather than US and European flows.
           

              
           

             Second, however, extreme correlations tend to reverse in time. (I mean, just look at 
            gold's current correlation with the stock market. Then look at what history says happens next.) So whether or not the old laws of nature are broken, there will be periods when rising rates hurt gold (or vice versa) and Western investment flows drive prices.
           

              
           

             Third, and most urgently, the return of those Western gold investment flows has become dramatic, thanks almost entirely to hot-money betting in the derivatives market. The net long position of 'Managed Money' traders, when added to the size of gold ETFs worldwide, has expanded in size by 16% from 6 months ago; the price of bullion has gained over 22%. But those bullish bets on Comex gold contracts by themselves have more than tripled in size, and that hot money is also running far ahead of the gains in gold over the 3-month and 1-month horizons too.
           

              
           

             Yes, the US Fed is 
            now nailed-on to start cutting interest rates at its September meeting in 2 weeks' time. Weaker competition for savings and investment Dollars from cash-in-the-bank will support further inflows to bullion.
           

              
           

             Lower interest rates should also encourage fresh betting on gold in the derivatives market by reducing the cost of betting against the Dollar. But with Comex bulls so far leading the charge in the return of Western investors to gold, there's limited scope for that trend to accelerate as interest rates fall, at least initially. There's plenty of scope, in contrast, for volatility and a price pullback in the meantime...
           

              
           

             ...not least around this week's ISM manufacturing survey, Thursday's services-sector report from the USA, plus Thursday and then Friday's US jobs data, and then next week's US consumer price inflation data.
           

              
           

             Beyond that, and after the Fed starts cutting rates this month, come's November's US election. Trump or Harris, it won't ease tensions with China nor over Ukraine or the Middle East. It's guaranteed to be inflationary too, thanks to higher budget deficits and trade tariffs.
           

              
           

             Against the backdrop of Washington's ever-growing debt mountain, that will support de-dollarization and gold-buying by central banks...
           

              
           

             ...albeit with more dynamic trading, perhaps, if prices spike amid post-election volatility in the currency markets...
           

              
           

             ...plus continued demand from wealth and fund managers worldwide, most especially in the USA as the Fed cuts monetary policy rates to try avoiding recession while fiscal policy pushes inflation to rebound.
           

              
           

             Does this mean fresh gains in gold are guaranteed? No, of course not. Especially not with silver prices failing to follow so far.
           

              
           

             The switch from Asian back to Western investment in gold has seen 2024's price jump in its more industrially-useful cousin stall and slip since June. So while gold-mining shares have at last turned higher on the stock market...
           

              
           

             ...finally rising as you would guess they should during a long-term bull run in gold itself...
           

              
           

             ...the lack of fresh gains in silver means that gold's big homecoming party isn't missing an important guest, because a key connection which analysts, traders and investors would expect stopped working this summer.
           

              
           

             What's more, further gains in gold might prove elusive over the next few weeks thanks to the speed and size of that sudden speculative betting on Comex derivatives.
           

              
           

             Indeed, the scale of the hot money's pile-on is waving a ""red flag"" for a possible price drop reckons Canadian stock brokerage TDS's commodity strategist Daniel Ghali:
           

              
           

             ""This set-up is the antithesis to the early-2024 dichotomy in [Western gold market] positioning that helped to propel the price on its trajectory towards current all-time highs. Downside risks are now more potent.
           

              
           

             ""The ship is crowded. In fact, it has scarcely been as crowded as it is today.""
           

              
           

             But longer term? Given lower rates and rising recession risks?
           

              
           

             Maybe gold is just 
            gonna need a bigger boat."

Article:Investment lessons from We and other disasters...

 It is SOMETHING of a truism within the advertising industry that good advertising is the best way to destroy a bad product, writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.
 The theory is that when people then try out the aforesaid bad product, and are hugely disappointed by its failings, they lose no time in telling their friends about its demerits, too.
 A variation on this theme has to do with the triumph of cheapness over quality; as Benjamin Franklin is believed to have said,
 ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.""
 (Those words will come to be engraved on the hearts of all ETF equity investors after the next bear market in stocks – which might well have just started.)
 But there's a paradox here, notably for asset managers, and especially for those setting up new businesses.
 On the one hand, you don't necessarily want to advertise your business, at least in any 'mass market' way that might attract short-term customers not necessarily aligned with your own process.
 But on the other hand, how can you possibly tell your target market about your product, service or fund?
 'Isaiah's Job' gets to the heart of the dilemma. You set out your stall and put out your message as best you can, and hope that some amongst 'the Remnant' will find it, and respond sympathetically to it.
 Whatever our religious convictions, we have a strong belief in the power of honest communications. Happily, today, the worldwide web, independent media and social media offer a way to at least try and address your target market without sacrificing your principles.
 Operating a website today is more or less costless. If you operate a website, you also have the potential for the equivalent of a television channel. If you operate a website, you also have the potential for the equivalent of a radio station – again, at virtually negligible cost. Which is one reason why, together with a technical analyst friend, Paul Rodriguez, we now record free, regular interviews with fellow professionals to discuss the state of the markets. We encourage you to dip into our archive.
 And it has long been a principle of ours never to engage with fund management companies that deploy mass market (paid-for) advertising. Going further, we believe asset management should be a cottage industry. Fund managers have (or at least should have) a fiduciary obligation to their clients, that puts the clients' interests first. Mass market asset gathering firms are simply not capable of engaging with their customers on that basis.
 The chief investment officer of one of the most successful investment funds in the world, the Yale Endowment, David Swensen, wrote an excellent book entitled 'Unconventional Success'. Over the past 30 years, Yale has enjoyed an average annualised return of over 12%. That title is an allusion to Keynes' famous observation that fund managers, courtesy of endemic groupthink, tend to prefer (and consequently often deliver) conventional failure as opposed to unconventional success.
 Swensen in his book pulls few punches. The fund management industry, for example, involves the ""interaction between sophisticated, profit-seeking providers of financial services [Keynes would have called them rentiers] and naïve, return-seeking consumers of investment products.
 ""The drive for profits by Wall Street and the mutual fund industry overwhelms the concept of fiduciary responsibility, leading to an all too predictable outcome: except in an inconsequential number of cases where individuals succeed through unusual skill or unreliable luck, the powerful financial services industry exploits vulnerable individual investors.""
 The nature of ownership is crucial to the likely end return. To Swensen,
 ""The ownership structure of a fund management company plays a role in determining the likelihood of investor success. Mutual fund investors face the greatest challenge with investment management companies that provide returns to public shareholders or that funnel profits to a corporate parent – situations that place the conflict between profit generation and fiduciary responsibility in high relief.
 ""When a funds management subsidiary reports to a multiline financial services company, the scope for abuse of investor capital broadens dramatically. In contrast, private for-profit investment management organizations enjoy the option of playing the role of a benevolent capitalist, mitigating the drive for profits with concern for investor returns.""
 In plainer English, the more mouths standing between you and your money that need to be fed, the poorer the ultimate investment return outcome is likely to be. In a rational world, investors would be well advised to favour smaller, entrepreneurial boutiques, or private partnerships, over larger, publicly listed full service investment operations – especially subsidiaries of banks or insurance companies – with all kinds of intermediary layers craving their share of your pie.
 So before buying any fund, ask yourself some questions:
 How big is it? The tree cannot grow to the sky. But try telling that to Blackrock, or to the average member of the Investment Association, or even to Vanguard, the world's largest provider of passive funds (at a time when we would argue the need for discrimination in investment choices has never been higher). Managers' pay is invariably linked to the size of funds under management. The more assets, the more pay. It takes guts, and principles, to turn money away and concentrate solely on investment performance. But that's precisely what many smaller investment boutiques do on a regular basis.
 Has the manager invested his own money? If he hasn't, why should you? Meaningful personal investment is by itself no guarantee of investment outperformance, but it shows the most basic alignment of interests between manager and investor.
 Is it independent, and owner-managed? David Swensen has gone on record saying he prefers the smaller, private partnership over the larger, listed full service operator. How many mouths must your fees go on to feed?
 Is the firm an asset manager, or an asset gatherer? This gets to the heart of the challenge facing investors today. The investment world is polarised between asset managers, who focus their energies on delivering the best possible returns for their clients, and asset gatherers, who just want to maximize the number of clients. Most fund management firms fall into the latter category. Favour the former.
 How to distinguish between the asset managers and the asset gatherers? Try to find managers like the celebrated investor Jean-Marie Eveillard, who once remarked:
 ""I would rather lose half of my shareholders than half of my shareholders' money.""
 A notorious 'victim' of reverse PR was Adam Neumann, founder of the office leasing company WeWork, which will likely go down in history as the high water mark for Dotcom Insanity 2.0. Says FT Alphaville's Jamie Powell:
 ""The following is a guest post by a successful reader of Alphaville who wishes to remain anonymous.
 ""A common complaint among my generation is that essential services like housing, education and transport have become so expensive that we've been excluded from enjoying the secure lifestyles many had before in their adult lives.
 ""However, I have proven the doubters wrong. By following some simple rules in life, I have retired at the age of 40 with enough money in the bank to live until I die.
 ""I know you all desperately want to know how I achieved such an astonishing feat, so here are the rules I followed which you too, dear reader, can emulate:
 ""Make coffee at home. You won't believe what a $3.50 saving a day will do to your bank account over the longer term.
 ""Keep holidays cheap. I never spent more than $600 on a trip, which meant exploring my local areas a lot more on my time off.
 ""Bring pack lunches to work. Have you ever considered how expensive Pret a Manger is? Think about it.
 ""Take public transport. Uber should be saved for special occasions only. Trust me, it makes a big difference.
 ""Invest in passive funds. Pick those indexes with the lowest fees, such as those provided by Vanguard, and allocate your money every month. Compound interest is the greatest force known to man.
 ""Bro down. Found a preposterous shared office space economy, build it with no regard for its underlying economics, secure an obscene valuation from a gullible capitalist, run it into the ground, and walk away with $1bn in stock sales and a $185m consulting contract.
 ""It literally is the easiest thing. Anyone can do it. Even you.""
 Touché.
 The story of WeWork really is a peach. For quasi-forensic analysis of the debacle, take Professor Scott Galloway's tech blog, No Mercy / No Malice, which is simply a must-read. Scott nails the WeWork insanity (almost entirely fuelled by SoftBank) in commentary dating from September 20th 2019; the fate of WeWork was already the chronicle of a death foretold (by Scott, amongst others):
 ""This was a case of immunities kicking in after the requisite SEC disclosure. As the greater fool theory has hit a wall, We will now need additional capital from the private markets, who are no longer under the influence. The firm will be forced to sell equity/issue debt at a price substantially lower than they had anticipated. A price unimaginable just 30 days ago.
 ""We has gone from unicorn to distressed asset in 30 days. In just seven days, We lost more value than the three biggest losers in the S&P 500 have lost in the last year combined: Macy's, Nektar Therapeutics, and Kraft Heinz.
 ""So, as a distressed asset, the playbook is fairly clear:
 ""Bring in new management. What got We here, isn't going to get it where it needs to go. Each layer that comes off the We onion stinks more and more. The media has turned its attention to the Neumanns, and it's as if the lights have been turned on at a cocaine-fuelled party that ended several hours too late. Everyone and everything suddenly looks bad, scary even. The firm needs to bust a move to break even pronto. The new CEO should be from a REIT, ideally a hospitality or commercial real estate REIT. My vote is Adam Markman, CFO of Equity Commonwealth – Sam Zell's firm.
 ""Shed/close all non-core businesses. WeGrow and WeLive are vanity projects. As someone close to the firm told me yesterday, they distract Mr.Neumann from the core business, where he was wreaking havoc. A $13 million investment in a firm that makes wave pools to indulge Adam's passion for surfing. Really? Really?
 ""Raise money after an adult conversation with SoftBank (""You f*cked up, you trusted us. Do you want to participate in the next round or get washed out?"")
 ""Focus on margin expansion vs. growth. We has a differentiated product in the marketplace, and should command a premium.
 ""Lay off all employees not directly tied to managing the core business. Reprice options for remaining employees, as the current options are now worthless and most execs will begin looking for other jobs. The most talented (the ones with the most options) will be the first to leave if they aren't given substantial economics for staying in Saigon as the North Vietnamese roll into town.
 ""3-5 new independent directors. Boards have their own dynamic, irrespective of the qualities of the individuals. The members of this board have formidable experience/CVs. Lew Frankfort (Director) is a first-ballot Hall of Fame retail exec, and he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who'd be bullied by the CEO, or anybody else for that matter. Again, I just can't figure out what the f*ck happened here. Who is the head of the audit committee, and was he (they were all dudes until last week) the one passing out MDMA before each audit meeting? Or, as a private firm, did they even have audit committee meetings? This is a board that approved a $13 million acquisition of a wave pool company. Or did they?
 ""The directors enabled an information pyramid scheme and indulged Adam, in exchange for hoping they could create enough valuation momentum, via nine rounds, to carry their shares to an exit in the public markets.
 ""SoftBank was reportedly considering propping up the IPO with $750 million in share purchases at the offering price. If that's the case, shouldn't they want to invest billions more at the now low-low 80%-off price? Or were they simply looking to pump and dump?
 ""The above likely won't happen. Why? As I said [before] the lines between vision, bullsh*t, and fraud are pretty narrow. I can't wrap my head around what's gone on here. Something is wrong. Something stinks. Something...Just. Doesn't. Add. Up.
 ""It's beginning to smell like malfeasance at We. The lines between vision, bullsh*t, and fraud have been crossed here. To be clear, I'm not a journalist, nor a forensic accountant. This is pure speculation based on my experience as a CEO, investor, and director. Something is very, very wrong here.""
 Avoiding high profile corporate disasters is less of a problem for investors well diversified by asset class, with portfolio protection (we favour precious metals and systematic trend-following funds), and who have a preference for attractive individual securities over the ownership of entire indices or markets. In any event, we have all been well and truly warned.
 Not all that glitters is gold."
2024-09-05,"Title:Peak Nvidia?
Article:How all bubbles end in the end...

 REMEMBER the stock market's mini-crash of 5th August? asks Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning, writing shortly before last week's quarterly earnings report from AI chip giant Nvidia.
 Well, investors apparently don't.
 That plunge seems like a distant memory at this point, as the ""buy the dip"" theme is a deeply entrenched force in today's market.
 Well, I'm afraid they could be about to get a stark reminder. Only this time, it'll be far worse.
 First off, why are stocks going up? The simple answer is that the market's in a bubble. There are a couple of things to consider.
 The S&P 500 is really the S&P Four, meaning it's a cap-weighted index. That means that the impact of a stock's price on the index is a function of its market capitalization. The bigger its market cap, the greater its impact on the index.
 Right now, the top 10 stocks in the S&P account for about 30% of the index.
 And it's just a small handful of stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google (Alphabet) and a couple of others that account for most of the market's gains this year.
 If you actually take the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 (503 to be precise), more of them are down this year than are up. So when you say the S&P is up 18% on the year, it presents a very distorted picture.
 Nvidia has been the market's leading performer, partly because of the latest market fad concerning artificial intelligence (AI) and GPT (generative pre-trained transformers). The AI boom has created hand-over-fist demand for Nvidia's chips.
 Do the people buying these stocks actually know what GPT is? No, most don't. But they don't want to miss the Nvidia gravy train.
 People buy into the hype because they don't want to miss out on the next big thing. And so they buy the stock. That drives the stock higher, which attracts more buyers, which drives the price even higher, which attracts even more buyers.
 It's a positive feedback loop. We're now in that feedback loop. It's amplified by institutional investors. Large index funds like Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity and some others have loaded up on Nvidia stock.
 What happens when they buy Nvidia? The stock price goes up. Then what happens? They buy more Nvidia stock because it has an even larger place in the index.
 So it's a process that feeds on itself. And it can go on for a long time. That's how bubbles form.
 How does it end? Well, it ends with a crash eventually. The music can't keep playing forever. The question then becomes when exactly is the music going to stop playing?
 It can be a difficult question to answer. You know it's a bubble, even if you don't know when it'll pop. You know it will, but you usually don't know the specific catalyst that will set the crash in motion. Often, the catalyst is only obvious in retrospect.
 The first factor to consider about Nvidia is that its valuation is absolutely sky-high. It has a P/E ratio of 75, which means investors are willing to pay $75 for each Dollar of earnings.
 But here's something most investors don't know: Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang and its CFO have been selling hundreds of millions of Dollars worth of Nvidia shares. In fact, they just hit a record of shares sold.
 Now, I've been general counsel for some very large companies. Insider selling like this isn't a sign of any problem by itself. A lot of times, the way executive compensation is structured means they end up selling shares on a set schedule.
 But when I looked into it, I noticed some other strange coincidences that made me dig in more. And I believe there's a good reason these insiders are selling their shares. And I found five major reasons why I believe Nvidia stock is about to get hammered in two days.
 Yes, Nvidia chips have been in high demand, which has helped fuel the Nvidia boom. But I've uncovered a lot of evidence that demand for Nvidia chips has peaked.
 Not only has demand peaked, but I believe it's actually shifting to other chipmakers. Increasingly, these AI chips are being designed in house at companies like Google and Amazon through partnerships with other companies. This lets them train AI models more cheaply.
 Another issue with Nvidia chips is that they're often too powerful for the different AI uses that these companies need.
 It's like using a cannon when you only need a rifle. It's simply overkill.
 Meanwhile, Nivida's chips are very expensive, and they require a lot of energy which also costs a lot. So by shifting to building their own in-house chips, these big tech companies are reducing their costs, and becoming independent of Nvidia.
 But Nvidia stock is basically ""priced for perfection"". The problem is when people expect perfection, anything less than perfect is bad news.
 Disappointment could trigger a massive market chain reaction, potentially leading to losses of 30%, 50% and even 80% among some of the biggest tech stocks that have been driving the market.
 If it happens, the major stock market indexes are going to get clobbered. It won't be the end of the world, I want to be clear about that. But the market could take a long time to recover.
 Which snowflake will trigger this avalanche? A massive amount of snow can accumulate before that one final snowflake comes along to start the chain reaction.
 The way to think about it is that the triggering snowflake might not look much different from the harmless snowflake that preceded it. It's just that it hit the system at the wrong time, at the wrong place.
 There's a lot of snow built up on this mountain. Nvidia could potentially be the snowflake that triggers an avalanche.
 I'm not telling you to panic, but I do want you to be prepared for a possible avalanche. If it doesn't happen, that's great, you can get on the ski lift and take another run down the mountain.
 But if an avalanche does occur, you'll sure be glad you avoided it."
2024-09-04,"Title:Millionaire Migration and Price Controls
Article:Shortages, stagnation and lower tax revenues...

 LAST MONTH, before she accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president, Vice President Kamala Harris threw her support behind President Joe Biden's tax proposals for 2025, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 They include a steep 44.6% capital gains rate and an unprecedented 25% tax on unrealized gains.
 
 I've spoken before about the absurdity of taxing unrealized gains. Today I want to discuss another alarming measure Harris supports: price controls.
 For those unaware, price controls are a type of government regulation that sets limits on how much prices or wages can increase. These can take the form of price ceilings, such as rent controls, or price floors, like minimum wage laws.
 On the surface, these measures might seem as though they're intended to protect consumers from inflation, but in reality, they often do more harm than good – and there are thousands of years' worth of examples. The economic principles that guide our markets are delicate, and when government intervention disrupts these natural forces, the consequences can be severe.
 
 Consider the issue of inflation, which has been a persistent concern for many Americans. We're all feeling the pinch at the grocery store, where food prices have risen 21% on average since Biden's inauguration.
 Harris's proposed solution – price controls – sounds appealing, but it's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.
 Most economists agree that price controls are not the answer. According to regular surveys conducted by the Chicago Booth School, a majority of economists do not believe that price controls could effectively limit US inflation over the course of a year.
 In a July survey, three quarters of economists either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that capping rent hikes at 5% annually would help Americans over the long run. Similarly, an overwhelming 62% either agreed or strongly agreed that controlling price increases would lead to ""substantial"" supply shortages.

 We don't have to look very far back in US history to see the dangers of price controls. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon imposed a 90-day freeze on all prices and wages in the United States.
 At first, the move was popular, giving Nixon a boost in his re-election bid the following year.
 But the initial success was short-lived. Nixon's plan contributed to a decade of stagflation – a toxic mix of high inflation and slow growth that eroded living standards for millions of Americans.
 
 It wasn't until 1983, midway through Ronald Reagan's first term as president, that the economy finally began to recover. In a radio address in October of that year, Reagan pointed to ""solid evidence that America has turned the corner toward long-term economic expansion.""
 The lesson is clear: Price controls are not a sustainable solution. They distort market signals, leading to inefficiencies and economic stagnation. Remember, prices serve as marketplace indicators. High prices might be frustrating for consumers, but they send an important message to producers: There's profit to be made here, so invest more. For consumers, high prices signal scarcity, which encourages them to use resources more wisely.
 Take gasoline as an example. If gas were to soar to $5 a gallon, people would probably cut back on non-essential driving. Meanwhile, the high price would encourage oil companies to ramp up production, which would eventually lead to lower prices.
 But what if the government artificially capped gas at, say, $2 a gallon? It would send the wrong signals to both consumers and producers. Consumers would drive just as much as before, if not more, exacerbating the scarcity, while producers would have less incentive to increase supply. This could lead to even higher prices down the road or, worse, 1970s-style gas shortages.
 Harris's support for a tax on unrealized gains would also have far-reaching consequences for the US economy. As I've said before, taxing gains on assets you haven't sold yet is not just absurd, it's dangerous. It's a policy that would drive capital out of the country at an unprecedented rate, leading to a loss of tax revenue and a weakening of our financial system.
 We're already seeing a mass exodus of wealth from high-tax states like New York and California to more tax-friendly states like Florida and Texas.
 
 But this trend is not limited to the USA.
 Globally, the movement of millionaires from countries with burdensome tax policies to more welcoming environments is accelerating. According to the Henley Private Wealth Migration Report, an estimated 128,000 millionaires are expected to relocate this year, surpassing the previous record set in 2023.
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks first in attracting this wealth by offering a business-friendly environment and luxurious living conditions. Conversely, countries like China and the United Kingdom are facing significant outflows of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) due to slowing growth, geopolitical tensions and unfavorable tax regimes.
 
 The implications of this ""great millionaire migration"" are profound. Wealthy individuals contribute significantly to the tax base, and their departure can cripple a nation's finances.
 The economic policies Vice President Harris supports – price controls and the taxation of unrealized gains – are misguided at best and catastrophic at worst. As history has shown us, these measures disrupt market forces, stifle economic growth and can lead to financial crises.
 If we want to preserve America's prosperity, we must resist these flawed policies and instead embrace the principles of free markets and limited government intervention. The stakes are too high to do otherwise."

Article:Number of new gold investors jumps at $2500...


              
           


WESTERN INVESTING sentiment towards gold bullion rose in August as prices hit fresh all-time highs, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault, now caring for $4.8 billion of precious metal for over 100,000 users from 175 countries.


              
           

             But after falling to a record low this March as gold jumped through $2200, investor appetite for buying gold has remained cautious while prices have continued rising, hitting new record highs above $2500 last month.
           

              
           

             Autumn 2024 offers plenty of reasons to start investing or build a position in gold, from today's rising recession risks to over-stretched stock markets and worsening geopolitical conflicts.
           

              
           

             For now, however, the action in gold prices is really still confined to derivatives contracts, rather than investment flows to physical metal. Traders betting on the depth of US monetary easing drove August's new record highs, and there's scope for gold prices to pull back this month as the Fed's first rate cut finally arrives.
           

              
           

             Tracking the number of people who buy securely-vaulted and insured gold over the number who sell it, the Gold Investor Index rose in August for the first time since May, adding half-a-point to 52.8.
           

              
           

             Running since October 2009, BullionVault's index would read 50.0 if the number of buyers exactly matched the number of sellers. The 
            Gold Investor Index hit a decade high of 65.9 as the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020.
           

              
           

             Sentiment then hit a series low 4 years later, dropping to 47.5 as prices jumped and more BullionVault users 
            chose to take profit than chose to buy the precious metal.
           

              
           




              
           

             While Western investors remain cautious towards gold's bull market, the volume of profit-taking has slowed relative to the size of gold's price gains, and the number of first-time investors has jumped as the US Fed prepares to follow Canada, New Zealand, the Eurozone and the Bank of England in cutting interest rates from two-decade highs.
           

              
           

             This month's US rate cut has been so long in coming, it's far from guaranteed to drive gold prices higher again. Longer-term however, weaker competition for investors' money from cash-in-the-bank will support new inflows to bullion, not least as fears that the Fed has left it too late to avoid recession run into November's fractious and divisive White House election.
           

              
           

             Averaging $2467 per Troy ounce with a price rise of 3.0%, August marked gold's 6th new month-average record in US Dollar terms of 2024 so far, matching the year-to-date counts of 2011 and 1973 with the highest figure since 1972.
           

              
           

             By weight, users of BullionVault sold 0.1 tonnes of gold more than they bought as a group, taking total holdings down 0.3% to the smallest in 4 years at 44.8 tonnes. By value however, those holdings rose 3.2% in US Dollar terms to a new record above $3.6 billion.
           

              
           

             The number of new account openings at BullionVault meanwhile rose 45.5% from the prior 12-month average, taking the number of first-time precious metals buyers up to its highest August figure since the pandemic surge of 2020.
           

              
           




              
           

             In contrast to gold, the month-average price of silver – which finds more than half its physical demand from industrial and technology uses – fell hard in August, down 4.1% in Dollar terms to the lowest since April at $28.52 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             While that boosted investor demand by weight – adding almost 8 tonnes to take total holdings 0.6% higher to a 5-month high of 1,175 tonnes worth $1.1bn – the number of silver buyers fell almost twice as hard as the number of sellers, down 11.0% from July's 16-month high.
           

              
           

             Together, that saw the Silver Investor Index reverse July's 0.4-point rise, falling back to 53.1 but holding positive after a record 3-month stretch of sub-50 readings between March and May.
           

              
           

             Silver's dual role as an investment and industrial metal have seen prices caught between gold's bull market and China's economic slowdown. Investors as a group continue taking advantage of silver's underperformance to rebuild their physical holdings after the strong run of profit-taking."
2024-09-02,"Title:10yr-2yr Yield Curve Poised to Un-Invert
Article:File under disinflationary, possibly deflationary...

 WE KNOW the story. A disgusting virus spread across the world, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole...
 ...terrorizing society into social and economic lockdown, causing crude oil to go to zero and many markets to begin a crash.
 The Fed sprang into action with Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP), QE, MMT and whatever other TMM (total market manipulation) it could think of in order to create the inflationary pathway out of the disaster.
 The result was an inflationary yield curve steepener, as the Fed lagged the ""transitory"" (ha ha ha) inflation it had created before finally getting on the hawk, jerking the Fed Funds rate upward and slamming the 10-2 yield curve into a hard flattener and inversion.
 Tilt Jerome, tilt!
 This flattening did not initially work well toward the usual economic boom associated with flatteners, because the market was obsessed with the newly hawkish Fed and its implications on a strengthening US Dollar, AKA the other side of the trade for most asset markets.
 Enter the 2022 ""bear market"" that wasn't (it was a correction). Then the yield curve floundered in inversion for a couple more years, up to this very day.
 However, it is now knocking on the door of de-inversion and a future steepening. Contrary to the overwhelming majority of commentators, we once again note that it is the steepener that follows the inversion that tends to bring on economic and market problems, AKA the bust end of the boom/bust equation. It's not the ""inversion"" trumpeted so loudly in the media.
 
 Along with several other macro indicators, the 10-2 yield curve is lurking and biding its time.
 Could it be different this time, with a new boom in the making that the soft-landers, Team Goldilocks and – even to a degree – ""de-Dollarizers"" may envision?
 Yeah, maybe. But these indicators are far from broken. They are just delayed, and they are in warning mode, as they have been for quite some time.
 Market management is a patience and perspective game."

Article:Trump's greatest gift to America...

 ASPIRING presidential nominee Harris has gurgled about price controls on food, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 Recently we shouted harshly against them.
 We argued that price controls brought with them economic maladies far worse than their supposed cures.
 Specifically, that shortages are their inevitable fruit – their sour fruit.
 Yet reader J.B. seized his ruler...and rapped us sharply upon the knuckles.
 He believes your correspondent is a misinformation merchant.
 He says:
 ""Democratic candidate Harris is proposing to promote competition and to apply antitrust laws against gouging...
 ""Sometimes I feel you think you're talking to the uninformed or even worse, trying to spread misinformation, as long as it serves to put in power the party you like...
 ""FYI, grocery stores' normal margin is 4%. They make their profits by the quantity they sell.""
 Just so. And J.B.'s comments contain not merely heat – but a certain degree of light.
 Grocers do profit by volume. It is true. They may also profit from appreciation of the real estate upon which their store squats.
 Other factors may goose grocers' profitability.
 Let us assume then that industry profits run not to 1 or 2% – but to 4%, as J.B. claims.
 Is a 4% profit margin a gouging?
 Profit margins in other industries far outhaul them.
 Under what profit margin would J.B. prefer grocers go along?
 J.B. claims Ms.Harris is out for competition.
 She is, in this instance at least, the child of Milton Friedman.
 Yet rating model DW-NOMINATE observes that her senatorial record indicates a general antagonism to markets.
 The lady was second only to the fantastically and feverishly progressive Elizabeth Warren.
 And progressives – in our findings – harbor deep suspicion of markets.
 We are inclined to say ""hostility to markets"" over ""suspicion of markets.""
 Yet we are in generous spirits today...thus we select the conciliatory option.
 We nonetheless cannot take aboard Ms.Harris' hatred of monopolies.
 After all: She aspires to king the greatest monopoly on Earth – the United States government.
 Here J.B. trains his cannons against us...and rains down fire upon our unshielded head:
 A Democratic president brought the pandemic to an end while your favorite ""Republican"" president was recommending to inject people with bleach. He left the economy in shambles.
 The Democratic president ended the supply crisis.
 Unfortunately, you use your knowledge to misguide people and spread propaganda.
 Our favorite ""Republican"" president?
 How did J.B. know the late Calvin Coolidge enjoys that high distinction?
 If J.B. refers to Republican president Trump he is not likely a longtime reader.
 We have dealt with Mr.Trump rather sharply in past issues.
 Yet the record reflects that Mr.Trump never advised the intake of bleach.
 And we would counsel J.B. about the hazards of disseminating misinformation.
 Do we misguide people and spread lies?
 To the extent of our knowledge we do not.
 We may err, it is true. We may be incorrect on this topic or that topic.
 Perhaps even another.
 We very likely are. Are we thus dishonest – or merely off course?
 In the above passages, J.B. radiates intense heat against Republicans.
 Yet he claims to be one himself! He is merely out for the middle class and the capitalist system:
 ""I am a Republican and don't approve of the way the talking heads try to win votes for their cause by lying instead of providing honest analysis.
 ""There is a huge income gap in this country. This is what will attract socialism. We need a prosperous middle class. The Democrats are doing a better job at that.
 ""Why don't we admit it and work together for the good of the country?
 ""BTW, your cynicism is sickening. Say the truth or say nothing!""
 We thank J.B. for his sage advice. But why should we start now?
 We will simply accept J.B.'s claim that he is Republican. Yet many Republicans fall within our range of acquaintance. Not one – not one – has ever claimed Democrats are superior stewards of the middle class.
 They invariably moan about Democrats' extortionate taxation and choking regulation of small business that besets the middle class.
 Again, we must accept J.B. at his word – that he is a Republican. Yet we harbor the suspicion he is going under false colors. He is not likely a Republican in our estimation
 It makes no nevermind of course.
 It is no concern of ours if the fellow is a Republican, Democrat, independent, communist, libertarian, anarchist, monarchist. It is all one to us.
 A man can say what he pleases...even your misleading, dissembling and propagandistic correspondent.
 So here we republish our musings on our ""favorite"" president, Trump – and why he should actually adorn Mt. Rushmore.
 Despite all odds...and all hell's angels...Donald Trump was crowned 45th president of the United States in 2016. With incomparable swagger and swashbuckle, he barreled into Washington; a berserker, a barbarian crashing the gates of Rome.
 Has a previous United States president ever babbled with a Queens accent? Had a previous United States president ever battled in a professional ring? Had a previous United States president ever bathed his steak in ketchup?
 Rumors swirled – meantime – that he mistook the salad fork for the dinner fork. But these were not demerits to his voters. They were in fact merits. He was the outside man, the scourge of the ""establishment,"" Democrat and Republican alike. He dug his thumbs into the eyes of each.
 The fellow was simply...sui generis.
 Was his intellect deeper than the skin that encased him? Perhaps it was not. But intellectual depth is vastly overrated in a president. It is often a downright menace. It is the ""deep thinkers"" who think the republic into its deepest fixes.
 The ""Sage of Baltimore,"" H.L.Mencken, certainly hooked onto something when he wrote:
 ""We suffer most when the White House bursts with ideas."" Woodrow Wilson – for example – was the only doctor of philosophy to ever seize the White House.
 He presided over Princeton University before he presided over the United States. And the nation is still afflicted with his lovely ideas. Who signed the Federal Reserve Act into law? The answer is Mr.Wilson. Who signed the federal income tax into law? The answer again is Mr.Wilson.
 The same Mr.Wilson ordered the doughboys ""over there."" 116,000 of them will remain forever over there. And the Versailles Treaty that closed the ""war to end all wars"" spawned the ""peace to end all peace.""
 WWI was ""the Great War"" until a greater war imposed a numerical arrangement upon it.
 In contrast to the intellectual president, we find Wilson's successor once removed – Calvin Coolidge. In Mencken's telling, Coolidge...Slept more than any other president, whether by day or by night...He had no ideas, and he was not a nuisance.
 Note the phrasing – it was not ""He had no ideas, but he was not a nuisance."" It was rather:
 ""He had no ideas, and he was not a nuisance."" Loftier praise for any president is scarcely imaginable: He had no ideas, and he was not a nuisance.
 But not all nuisances are equal. Some even serve high purposes. Our central criticism of Mr.Trump is not that he was a nuisance...but that he was not nuisance enough.
 He was elected, in fact, to be a nuisance – less a statesman than a demolition man – a sapper planting dynamite beneath ruling class trenchworks, beneath the ""deep state"" fortifications that ring the nation.
 Yet President Trump never struck the match. He was in many fashions a man out of his depth...a political naif surrounded by jackals, turncoats, sharpers and cutthroats. Thus he failed to ""drain the swamp.""
 And yet – and yet – the fellow nonetheless performed a high, high service to the nation. It is so worthy of praise that we recommend Mr.Trump's etching onto Mt. Rushmore in the austere Black Hills of South Dakota.
 Like crooks smoked out by the lawman, the swamp monsters came flushing out of the murk...and exposed themselves to the public gaze. Their disdain for the man was so vast, their aching to undo him so acute, they could not resist the pull.
 Trump drew them out. They could no longer slink along in the shadows. Here is the fellow's cardinal presidential attainment, an accidental attainment at that:
 He renewed America's distrust of its gatekeeping elites, its patrolmen of permissible thought.
 How many Americans were familiar with the term ""deep state"" before President Trump?
 A corporal's guard perhaps. Yet it has now entered the popular vernacular.
 Most Americans likely held the Federal Bureau of Investigation in high regard prior to 2016.
 But after the massively discredited Steele dossier and ""Russiagate?"" Today, many Americans would trust a dog with their dinner before they would trust the FBI with the truth.
 How many Americans booed the Centers for Disease Control before...or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases? Today many millions of Americans boo them.
 And does the mainstream media retain one tattered rag of credibility? The Trump presidency revealed the media's monomaniacal hatred for the man, a hatred that burned with the heat of 5,000 suns. All standards of objective journalism went emptying into the hellbox.
 Meantime, social media excommunicated Trump and legions of his enthusiasts – often for harmless and inoffensive blabberings. Examples run and run. Add them one with the other...and the American people are now on our guard as never before.
 We sniff a rodent.
 The late Dr.Angelo Codevilla professed international relations at Boston University. He was the indomitable and implacable foe of America's ""ruling class,"" its fierce nemesis.
 The ruling class, above referenced: The unelected rogues, rascals, cadges, chiselers, grifters, ne'er-do-wells and swindlers that loot, hagride and menace us. And to recapture their nation, argued Codevilla, Americans must disrespect the institutions that disrespect them:
 These government elites and government-certified experts have been disastrously wrong and corrupt...
 Discrediting and negating [them] is essential to freeing republican Americans from the oligarchy's grip. This most important post-Trump task begins with disrespecting the oligarchy's every part. That means denying their claim to be exercising legitimate republican functions.
 Truth is, the FBI, CIA, and Justice Department act as agents of an oligarchic regime at war with our Republic and with republican Americans. To respect them is to disrespect ourselves...To disrespect them all is to respect the truth...
 Even if their expertise in everything from education to the military had turned out to be genuine, it would not negate the inalienable interest that the rest of us have in living our lives as we see fit – in our own freedom, in pursuing our own interests according to our own lights.
 That is why the next generation of leaders must transcend Trump by debunking, defunding, and disempowering the establishment in education, medicine and public health, law enforcement, national security, on down the line.
 And so we lift our qualified hymn in praise of Mr.Donald John Trump. He pulled back the curtain on the ""deep state""...and forced them to expose their mischiefs in full public view. In the process...he may ultimately enable Americans to reclaim the authority that is justly theirs.
 Trump for Rushmore!"
2024-08-29,"Title:Vigilance vs. Overreach in Social Media
Article:Social media needs controlling, say the controllers...

 SOCIAL MEDIA has become the place where many of us spend our time, share our lives and, increasingly, get our news, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 An estimated 12 billion combined hours are spent every day on these platforms, which now host over 5.3 billion unique ""identities"" or accounts.
 
 With scaling like that, misinformation can spread like wildfire. We've all seen the headlines, the ""fake news"" and the deepfakes that make you question your own eyes.
 For investors, this isn't just about the latest gossip. Misinformation (information that's false or inaccurate) and disinformation (fake news deliberately meant to confuse and deceive) can move markets. A recent study showed a correlation between social media interactions and short-term stock market movements.
 This isn't just noise; it's noise with consequences. Last year, Nationwide Mutual Insurance found that more than a third of non-retired investors aged 18-54 acted on financial information from the internet or social media that turned out to be misleading or incorrect.
 The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) further complicates matters. We've already seen instances of AI-generated images causing market jitters, such as when someone posted fake images of an explosion near the Pentagon last year. As AI technology advances, distinguishing fact from fiction will become increasingly more challenging.
 It's no surprise that Americans are expressing a historic lack of confidence in news media and issuing calls for increased regulation of online content.
 
 However, we must be extremely cautious about how we approach this issue.
 Governments, in their wisdom or perhaps in their panic, have decided to step in, and they're not just playing referee. They're threatening to be the players, coaches and umpires all at once.
 Take the recent violence in the United Kingdom. False rumors quickly spread about the identity of the man who allegedly attacked and killed two British girls on July 29, leading to nationwide riots and the arrest of over 1,000 people. So far, two men have been sentenced to months in prison for their activity on social media.
 While it's understandable that authorities want to crack down on those inciting violence, the British government's threats have, in my opinion, gone too far. London's police chief has even suggested that American citizens may be extradited from the US to the UK to face charges for online comments. This is a dangerous overreach that sets a troubling precedent.
 Similarly, the European Union's warning to Elon Musk about content moderation on X (formerly Twitter) ahead of his interview with former President Donald Trump last week smacked of attempted censorship. I agree that these platforms should have policies against explicitly illegal content, but vague ""hate speech"" laws are a slippery slope that can easily be abused.
 Here's my take: Yes, misinformation is a problem. It can contribute to real-world chaos, from market fluctuations to societal unrest. But the solution isn't to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We need to be smarter, not just louder.
 That starts with educating ourselves. In the investment world, we live by ""trust, but verify."" It's time we apply this thinking to our information diet by fact-checking the news as though our portfolios depend on it. And just like our portfolios, it's important to diversify where we get our news.
 Having said that, I believe that if a social platform is going to moderate content, it must do so transparently. Let's know the rules of the game. Vague threats of ""hate speech"" without clear definitions? That's like playing chess where the rules change every move.
 Benjamin Franklin wisely said that those who would give up their liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. The challenges of being an informed citizen and investor in today's information landscape are real, but I don't believe they justify heavy-handed government intervention.
 Misinformation is a beast, but so is overreach. Let's stay vigilant, think critically and remember that the free flow of information – even when it's occasionally messy – is essential for both healthy markets and healthy democracies.
 Stay invested, stay informed and most importantly, stay free."
2024-08-28,"Title:Gold Stocks Break Out vs. SPX
Article:Buggish gold investors, fear not...

 The GOLD STOCK sector is on the verge of taking back the macro, and taking leadership over the broad S&P500, says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 This post is prompted by a post I saw on X, highlighting a technical analyst on CNBC who noted the inverted head and shoulders that the HUI index of gold mining stocks is establishing in ratio to SPX.
 The follow-on discussion included some fretting that the contrarian negatives of being highlighted on CNBC are a clear and present danger.
 As you know if you've read me or heard me talking about gold stocks this year, I believe the macro is and has been in transition to a state that will take many by surprise, including gold bugs. As for the contrary negative of a CNBC highlight, it's been 4 years in hell since gold stocks topped out in summer 2020 (rightly, given the macro backdrop since then, I might add).
 It has also been 4 years during which gold stocks have been drubbed by the headline US stock index. It is beyond the scope of this post to dredge up all the macro reasoning about why it is different this time. Again, if you read and heard me, you already know.
 This article simply illustrates the beauty of the ratio between the HUI and the S&P and its message that there is no way there could be much damaging contrary sentiment out there presently.
 Here is a weekly chart showing the ratio. Ladies and Gentlemen, cast your gaze upon some real eye candy. It has been 4 damn years in the wilderness for this most hated of stock sectors. A non-constructive macro has bred that hatred.
 
 But a constructive macro coming from the depths of this chart's base/bottom? It's only just getting started.
 Of course there will be volatility and testing of will. But when you have the fundamentals behind you, it sure is easier to deal with that. The ratio is creeping out of the pattern, has positive and yet not overbought weekly RSI and MACD, and is good to go. Finally, the weekly EMA 10 is crossed above the EMA 20 and that is a positive as well. A ""buy"" signal of sorts from April.
 Now we'll see if it goes. If not now, and if the macro continues to pivot as it has been, it'll go soon enough, in my opinion.
 
 This chart shows an alternate interpretation of the breakout (blue line). In this version it is just an in-week break, needing a weekly close to send a signal.
 Mr.Slammy? You out there? I don't put much importance on trend lines as you may know, but I wanted to put this version out there. Of more importance is the creep above the pattern's neckline."
2024-08-27,"Title:Gold ETF Inflows Flip from Asia to Western Investing
Article:US and European trusts expand as China and India gold ETFs shrink...


              
           


GOLD ETF buying has flipped from Asia to Western investment markets as the precious metal sets new record prices, with trust funds in China and India shrinking after a run of strong growth while European and North American products have begun growing after near-relentless profit-taking.
           

              
           

             After expanding in 38 of the prior 52 weeks according to data gathered and published by the mining industry's World Gold Council, 
            gold ETFs listed in Asia shrank by 5.3 tonnes across the past fortnight – the heaviest 2-week outflow since Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.
           

              
           

             Gold ETF products in Europe and North America, in contrast, shrank every month between June 2023 and May 2024, extending 
            a near-relentless run of investor profit-taking in gold starting in spring 2022. But trust funds in both regions have now expanded together in 7 of the past 8 weeks, the strongest such stretch in 27 months.
           

              
           




              
           

             While the giant GLD gold-backed ETF was unchanged in size Monday, world No.2 the IAU – also with its primary listing in New York – expanded by another 0.2%. That kept their combined size close to end-July's figure of 1,227 tonnes, the highest month-end so far in 2024. 
           

              
           

             Comparable investment funds listed in mainland China or Hong Kong had meantime grown to a record combined size by the end of July, expanding by 49.8% in the first 7 months of 2024 while gold ETFs in India grew close to their record size of New Year 2013 
            on the World Gold Council's data. But overall, Asian gold ETFs shrank for a second week running in the 5 sessions ending last Friday, down by 2.0% with fresh profit-taking reversing more of this year's previous surge.
           

              
           

             Western investors ""have been repositioning in favour of gold in the past couple of months,"" says Jonathan Butler, head of business development and strategy at Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi's precious metals division, noting ""a modest uptick in [global] gold ETF holdings of around 3% since early June.""
           

              
           

             Bullish betting among speculators in Comex gold futures and options contracts – traded and settled by the CME derivatives exchange based in New York – has also grown as prices shot to fresh all-time records, with the net long position of Managed Money traders rising last week back to mid-July's 4-year high on data from US regulators the CFTC and reaching 155% of the long-term average.
           

              
           

             But like Western ETFs, the ""relatively modest scale"" of the growth in these gold derivatives positions – especially given the move in gold prices – ""suggests there is further upside to come"" for investment inflows and price gains, says Butler.
           

              
           




              
           

             With the 
            US Federal Reserve now universally expected to start cutting Dollar interest rates from 2-decade highs next month, ""recent investor inflows are [only] 1/4th the size of the inflows seen in the 2-month preemptive runup to the 2019 rate cutting cycle,"" says strategist Nicky Shiels at bullion refining and finance group MKS Pamp.
           

              
           

             So even with gold prices jumping last week above $2500 per Troy ounce for the first time, ""by no means are all investors firing on all cylinders,"" Shiels says. This means the ""Powell Pivot"" – now confirmed by the Fed chairman's dovish comments in Friday's Jackson Hole speech – ""[plus] any incremental US Dollar weakness, should see inflows accelerate into [November's US] elections.""
           

              
           

             At the same time, says Butler at Mitsubishi, ""Gold is about to enter a period of seasonally higher physical demand in the run-up to Chinese National Day holidays,"" and ""the focus of seasonal gold demand will be first in India ahead of the key wedding and festival season,"" adds Wayne Gordon, commodities strategist at the Global Wealth Management division of Swiss banking giant UBS.
           

              
           

             Dussehra in mid-October and Diwali in early November are key events for gold jewelry demand in India, the precious metal's No.2 consumer market. But while 
            last month's surprise cut to India's gold import duty initially revived demand through 'formal' channels and hit smuggling flows with a drop in legal bullion costs to consumers, ""physical demand for gold is under pressure as prices continue to make higher highs and higher lows"" notes Gordon at UBS.
           

              
           

             Gold prices in China – the precious metal's No.1 nation for mining, importing, consumer demand and central-bank buying – have meantime run below spot bullion quotes in global hub London for 7 sessions running. The longest such stretch since June 2021, that suggests weak demand versus local supplies, and stands in stark contrast to 
            the record-high Shanghai premiums preceding the sharp upturn in global gold prices starting last autumn."

Article:How to survive the Great Unwinding...?

 LET'S START with three stipulations, writes Charles Hugh Smith on his OfTwoMinds blog, reposting at Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 First, this is not investment advice; everything here is an observation based on history or my personal experiences after previous bubbles have popped
 Second, there are no easy answers – none.
 Third, my last three books can be viewed as a trilogy describing macro and individual responses to the Great Unwinding.
 Do I have all the answers? No. Nobody does. All we can assemble is a coherent response based on the lessons of history and system dynamics: what's fragile, risky and undependable and what's lower risk and more resilient.
 Since no response is easy, we're talking about degrees of difficulty and what's within reach for each of us. We all have limits of experience, location, skills, capital, networks and so on.
 Therefore there's no ""one size fits all"" template that's going to work for everyone. The whole point of my book on Self-Reliance is that we each have to plan our own responses; we can't just follow somebody else's plan.
 There's a great divide between what Americans want/expect and what's realistic. The average American feels they need to earn over $180,000 to live comfortably, according to a recent survey.
 The survey also found that only 6% of US adults make $186,000 or more, while the median family income is between $51,500 and $86,000. In other words, everyone feels they'd be OK if they joined the top 6%, meanwhile those households earning $180,000 are feeling that they need to earn $300,000 to be comfortable.
 If you and your spouse/partner can skim off $300,000 or more annually, go for it. In terms of risk management, it might be prudent to assume one of you loses your job at some point, so figuring out how to live on $100,000 now rather than later makes sense.
 Many readers report that they've already fashioned a low-cost, resilient lifestyle, generally by living in a lower cost rural locale with cheaper housing, paying off debt, doing their own repairs and maintenance on homes and vehicles, growing some of their own food and finding like-minded people in the community to share/work with.
 Establishing a low-cost lifestyle demands sacrifices, many of which are ""impossible"" or out of reach in the current zeitgeist: the jobs and excitement are in cities and suburbs that are unaffordable.
 Learning how to repair, maintain, grow, cook, bake and build also takes time, effort and sacrifice. The transition from consumer to producer is not easy.
 It's been a long time since Americans experienced a ""real recession."" The last ""real recession"" was in 1981-82, over 40 years ago. Since then, recessions have been brief due to unprecedented bailouts and stimulus.
 The returns on bailouts and stimulus have diminished, and expecting the same tricks to work like magic again is, well, magical thinking. Things have changed, and it may be less like 2000 or 2009 and more like 1973: nine years of turmoil and inflation that refuses to return to zero.
 The biblical seven abundant years, seven lean years comes to mind. Humans predictably respond to abundance by gleefully squandering what's plentiful in the good times, and then frugally hoarding whatever is left when the lean times kick in. Frugality is common-sense: waste nothing, need less, get serious about your Plan B and Plan C.
 Are there safe havens for your capital? There are certainly many claims made about safe havens, and I can only speak from my experience of bubbles popping over the past 50 years. The current bubble is unique in being an Everything Bubble, in which traditional safe-haven asset classes have already been front-run by the smart money.
 In my experience, every asset goes down when massive credit-asset bubbles pop as the ""good"" assets get sold to cover margin calls as ""bad"" assets plummet and debts have to be serviced/paid down. That's the downside of a financial system that is completely dependent on debt and leverage for its survival: the asset valuations can collapse but the debts remain and can only be cleared by bankruptcy/liquidation/insolvency.
 Assets drop to levels that are considered ""impossible"" at the top of the bubble. This is the mindset of bubbles: the current valuations are entirely rational, and history says they'll only move higher over time.
 This is how stocks that fell from $60 to $45 got recommended as a ""strong buy"" and then eventually bottomed at $4. Skyscrapers were sold for the value of their elevators in the Great Depression.
 Earning 4% on cash looks pretty good when others playing ""catch the falling knife"" have lost 40% of their capital. Patience tends to pay off as bubbles pop and furious counter-rallies tempt bottom-fishers and buy-the-dippers.
 If history is any guide, bubbles take a few years to completely deflate, as the speculative frenzy takes a long time to dissipate as gamblers' capital and desire to bet are whittled away.
 The cliche is cash is king in asset-bubble deflations, and there's a reason for this. Cash may lose some purchasing power due to inflation, but it's earning some income to offset inflation. Every other asset that soared in the bubble is exposed to the selling that comes from having to pay down debt, unwind leverage and get out now before I lose even more money.
 The risks of patiently waiting for the bubble to completely deflate are low compared to the risks of trying to rotate in and out of deflating assets ahead of the bots and smart money, who are masters of juicing manic counter-rallies to suck in the impatient and speculators who are overly anxious to ""buy the dip.""
 Note that Wall Street never recommends frugally piling up cash for a few years, as that generates no income for Wall Street, which thrives off the herd busily churning away capital chasing the latest hot rotation into bat guano futures, cobalt mines in Lower Slobovia, the Hydrogen economy, AI-powered robot pets, and so on.
 Maybe fortunes will be minted, maybe not, but staying out of the casino and waiting for the bottom, when everyone has given up, is never going to be touted by anyone in the casino.
 Recall that it doesn't matter what the ""market"" deems as the ""fair price"" for productive real-world assets. If my house is ""worth"" $1000 or $1 million, it still provides shelter. If a homestead produces 1,000 pounds of nutritious food a year, it doesn't matter whether the ""market value"" of the land is $1000 or $1 million.
 That only matters if we're speculating or leveraging debt. If we're only interested in the use value, then the ""market"" gyrations are of zero interest.
 What's the ""real value"" of anything? That depends. My wife just bought a pair of almost-new Merrell brand shoes that retail for $100 for $2 at a thrift store. For somebody, the shoes were worth $100. Now they're worth a few Dollars.
 Everyone's a genius in a bubble, but over time, few survive even five years of volatility. It may look easy to have caught the highs and lows of the 1970s, but few managed to do so.
 History suggests being wary of the ""strong buys"" at $45 when the eventual bottom is $4. This is of course ""impossible."" Everyone thought that in 2000 and 2008, too, and it's the dominant mindset once again.
 The opportunities lie ahead – far ahead.
 There's much to be said for this simple strategy: get lean, get frugal, pay off debt, save cash, get your Plans B and C in order, learn as much as you can to increase what you can do in the real world for yourself and your household, lower your exposure to non-linear disruptions and systemic risks beyond your control, turn a deaf ear to the touts and stay out of the casino."

Article:4 key takeaways on natural resources...

 I RECENTLY attended the annual Rick Rule resource conference in Boca Raton, Florida, writes Byron King in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Who doesn't want to swelter in 95-degree temps in the shade and 95% humidity? Then again, and as an old friend – a rompin', stompin' retired Navy SEAL – says, ""There's no bad weather, only inappropriate clothing and poor preparation.""
 No need to fret, though. It was all okay because the heat and humidity were outside, while we were inside a superb venue with excellent air conditioning and many other great amenities. And c'mon; hot weather or no, I was there to learn, and learn I did. Because Rick puts on one of the best resource-focused conferences you'll find anywhere.
 This recent event was four solid days of deep dives into junior and intermediate-scale resource companies, particularly gold and silver, royalty ideas and the fast-evolving world of copper.
 Let's look at four key takeaways.
 Day One began with an insightful talk about gold by Dana Samuelson, president of the American Gold Exchange of Austin, Texas. He runs a sizable operation, and when you sell hundreds of millions of Dollars in gold and silver coins and bullion, you tend to know things.
 First, per Dana, ""beware of fake gold."" That is, Dana is a certified numismatist who has served for many years as an expert witness in litigation over quality and purity disputes, as well as for the US government in fraud and other criminal prosecutions.
 Dana's point was that with rising gold prices, the market has attracted fraudsters. Incidents are rising of coins and metal bars that are not what they purport to be. With ingots and even some coins, gold and silver may be alloyed down in purity.
 You can only tell with sensitive measuring techniques. In extreme cases, a so-called ""gold"" bar may be nothing more than a gold veneer over a mass of far less valuable tungsten. And more than a few coins for sale on websites may also be counterfeit, even ones inside those impressive-looking plastic slabs.
 This is not a reason not to buy physical coins and ingots, etc. But it is a caution to be careful and judicious with whom you deal. Dana's advice is to buy from established, reputable dealers. You should ask about the background of the people on staff, particularly what's their expertise in the field, as well as what testing equipment and method they utilize to ensure the fineness of the metal offered for sale.
 And one final point: If or when the time comes to sell a coin or metal ingot, it helps to go to the dealer from whom you bought it in the first place. Good dealers ought to be willing to buy back what they sold you, allowing for price changes.
 And it's not hard to understand that many dealers don't want to buy products that they never carried or sold in the first place, like many specialty coins.
 Dana also offered solid insights into the current worldwide demand for gold. In essence, central bank gold buying has soared in the past two years, while investment demand for gold from Asia is way up as well.
 As for central banks, the historical trend is that about 15% of total annual global gold output from mines has gone into central bank vaults; but in the past two years, since mid-2022, that number has more than doubled.
 In fact, right now about a third of the annual global gold mine output is being purchased by central banks. This alone is a major change in the supply-demand dynamics of the metal.
 It's not hard to understand why central banks have increased their gold buying. It's directly traceable to Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine military operation which commenced in February 2022.
 Shortly thereafter, the US and Western allies froze about $350 billion in Russian-owned US Treasury securities; that is, state assets of the Russian Federation. Another way to say it is that the US and Western partners confiscated Russian state funds, and this sent shock waves across the world.
 If the US can freeze the assets of a nuclear power like Russia, what chance does anyone else have if politicians and bureaucrats in Washington decide to pull a money grab? The immediate and most effective means to protect assets is to de-Dollarize by selling off US Treasuries and use the proceeds to buy physical gold.
 At least then central banks can control their own fate via hard assets and avoid counterparty risk. Meanwhile in Asia – mostly China, but many other nations as well – investors are buying more and more physical gold and silver.
 The idea is to transfer funds out of depreciating local currencies, and at the same time avoid the traceability that comes with something like buying US Treasuries. Meanwhile, gold is a hedge against inflation both in local currency as well as with US Dollars.
 Up and down the line, Asian gold buying is strong. Purchasers range from individual investors to family offices, banks, businesses and even governments, plus the above-noted central banks.
 Right now, considering the current world situation, people and institutions in many places wish to avoid local currencies and even Dollars and accumulate an immutable asset with the capability to protect wealth across years and even generations. Hence the trend toward gold buying.
 With rising gold prices, one part of the sector has done quite well, namely royalty companies. These are not mining plays, though; they're more like specialized bankers to the mining industry. And when gold prices rise, shares in royalty plays tend to move early and fast. Here's how it works.
 Let's say that an exploration or development project is proceeding apace out in the field, but the company needs cash. Management can issue new shares, but that dilutes existing shareholders. And most commercial banks won't lend at decent terms to a project that isn't producing gold or cash flow.
 So along come royalty companies with a business model designed to advance funds into a project in return for a future payout, or even a stream of actual metal, when the project goes into production. There's much geological thinking, engineering and solid banking involved in the business, and every deal is different.
 But the idea is that the royalty company puts money into a project in the early days, and then benefits long afterward from its foresight and patience. One great advantage of the royalty model is that the company avoids most day-to-day issues of running a mine.
 Royalty companies generally don't worry too much about the price of diesel fuel, or labor issues, or the logistics of operations or much more. They put their funds into play with the project operator, and then after a while collect a payout on the backend.
 Anyway, it's a potentially lucrative option you might want to consider if you want exposure to the precious metals market."
2024-08-14,"Title:CBS Says What?
Article:'Buy gold' advises the big US news outlet...

 WHAT is this? gasps Brian Maher at The Daily Reckoning.
 CBS News is advising you to acquire gold?
 We are waylaid, gobsmacked and astounded. Yet it is true.
 ""There are multiple reasons why beginners should consider investing in the metal as soon as this week,"" we are informed.
 CBS News proceeds to cite the three central reasons. Reasons one:
 ""With many experts predicting a price of $3000 per ounce shortly, now is the time to buy in while it's still affordable. If you wait, you could miss out on the portfolio protection a gold investment can provide. And the price could rise within days.""
 Reasons two:
 ""While a reduction in the federal funds rate [didn't occur last month], the Fed [gave] greater insight into their decision-making process and the chances of a rate cut to come in September when they meet again...
 ""In this scenario, more investors may turn to gold for protection, causing the price to rise.""
 More investors have evidently turned to gold for protection, causing the price to rise.
 Its price skyshot higher after the Fed's 'no change' decision at its most recent meeting.
 The betting market presently gives 100% odds of a September rate reduction.
 Reasons three:
 ""A changing inflation rate and what many expect to soon be a lower interest rate climate may soon combine to affect your portfolio, perhaps significantly...A diversified portfolio can help take advantage of some volatility, such as those offered by stocks and bonds, while still offering some protection against larger economic concerns.
 ""Gold can adequately perform the latter function, especially if it's done in the form of 10% or less of your overall portfolio.""
 Perhaps CBS News is at last heeding the counsel of Jim Rickards.
 It is unlikely – yet we must consider the possibility.
 Jim believes gold is destined not merely for $3000 or $5,000 or even $10,000.
 Jim believes gold is destined ultimately for $15,000.
 Here is why 'Bond King' Jeffrey Gundlach believes investors are herding into gold:
 ""I think there is just growing awareness that developed country governments are completely out of control.
 ""I feel like the average person is starting to realize the gravity of this problem...that we are running on a debt-based scheme with no end in sight. And I just think that people are starting to think that 'Maybe I should own...real money'.""
 We hazard there is justice here.
 What stands behind the Dollar?
 Ultimately, the word of the United States government.
 That is, nothing stands behind the Dollar.
 If you seek a substance behind it you will not find one. It is not there.
 And it is increasingly evident to those with eyes to see it.
 Hence the hunger for ""real money"".
 Are you after real money of your own?"
2024-08-09,"Title:Buy the Crash in Stocks?
Article:When it's really time to buy, you won't want to...

 I WAS enjoying a cocktail on my neighbor's porch last Saturday night when the skies suddenly changed, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Thunder rolled in as the horizon turned an ominous shade of purple and the wind began bending the treetops. We retreated inside just a few moments later as the first raindrops fell and watched the storm unfold from the safety of the kitchen.
 It was gone almost as quickly as it appeared – but the powerful storm left plenty of damage in its wake. Residents reported power outages, more than 400 downed trees, and 170 blocked roadways throughout the city.
 Aside from a few short power outages, my neighborhood was spared. The only evidence in the yard were a few stray sticks and branches, which we cleaned up on Sunday afternoon before I sat down at my desk to survey the markets and prepare for the new trading week...
 As you might imagine, I couldn't help but think the universe was toying with me when I saw the market begin to unravel in Japan and spread through crypto and the futures market.
 Stocks were in freefall – no doubt about that.
 But how long would the storm last?
 Before we attempt to answer this question, let's take a minute to review how it all went down...
 Japan found itself in meltdown mode as the Yen carry trade [borrowing the Japanese currency at 0% interest rates and buying other, higher-rate currencies or assets] imploded and global recession fears spread. The Nikkei fell more than 12% on Monday, which the WSJ notes is its biggest drop since the 1987 crash.
 Of course, the selling didn't stop there. The bloodshed in the Asian markets spread into crypto, which spilled over to US equities by the early morning hours. We were already seeing some small pockets of worry crop up late last week, which began to snowball early Monday morning. You always know the market is making waves when non-financial types are posting about the carnage on social media – and the panic was certainly palpable Monday morning.
 The market was dumping and the VIX spiked to levels not seen since the Covid crash. The bell rang – and investors started selling.
 These are the days that put traders and investors to the test. How you react to major selloffs can affect your portfolio for months to come. If you aren't prepared and you begin to make panicked decisions, you can cause serious damage to your returns.
 In ""meltdown"" situations, the survivors will be those who can remain calm and focused when everyone else is running around with their hair on fire.
 While I can't yet tell you how the averages will look at the end of the week, we can discuss what to expect in a higher volatility environment like the one we're entering right now – and how you should adjust your trading strategy as stocks sail into rough waters.
 #1. When Investors are Scared, Cash is King Even in bullish conditions, the market rarely cares about any of the amazing stories about your favorite investments. You can't argue fundamentals or growth stories in a crashing market. If panic conditions emerge, investors only want cash. They crave safety above everything else.
 Crypto is the perfect example of this phenomenon. I know there are plenty of folks who argue that Bitcoin is a safe haven investment. But the market says otherwise! Crypto actually trades like a risk asset.
 That's why we watched Bitcoin get smashed into the low $50K range late Sunday as more than a few crypto traders were liquidated. When the margin call comes, the only way to pay is cold, hard cash!
 If investors are raising cash, they will sell anything and everything, even gold. You might remember that gold even dropped a staggering 25% during the throes of the August to October 2008 meltdown. Keep in mind, this was in the middle of a huge bull cycle for gold, which was unceremoniously interrupted by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the ensuing financial crisis.
 Investors will also sell their big winners during these times of distress. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has tumbled nearly 30% from its July highs. The Nasdaq 100 is down 15% over the same timeframe.
 
 Yes, even the bulletproof Magnificent Seven stocks are collectively more than 20% off their all-time highs.
 #2. Stocks ""Hold Hands"" During Down Markets The market becomes highly correlated during drawdowns and panic events.
 What does this mean?
 Simply put, on the big, sweeping down days and crashes, most groups and asset classes react with similar moves.
 Correlations are lower during bull markets. You'll have big winners, middling names, and laggards. Think about how the market was acting earlier this year. We have semiconductor stocks leading the market by a mile, many tech names also cruising higher (just not as much), while other sectors lagged.
 That doesn't happen during sustained drawdowns. When everyone is fighting for the exits, very few areas are safe from the sellers. And I'd venture to guess that most of the visible stocks will be down about the same as the averages during these dumps, with some of the higher-flying names from the past few months taking some bigger hits.
 When sentiment sours and investors become more cautious and defensive, it's that much more difficult for individual groups to outperform.
 #3. Respect the Swings When markets suddenly get squirrely, you probably experience a strong urge to do something, anything, to right the ship.
 But part of investing or trading is simply surviving. After all, you have to preserve your capital if you want to stay in the game! And since we just experienced a severe volatility spike, it's important to remember that we're probably going to see strong moves both higher and lower in this new environment.
 Volatility can be your best friend or your worst enemy. If you're a longer-term investor, you have a great opportunity to start nibbling at some of your favorite companies (If you liked it at $70, you'll love it at $50, right?)
 If you're a trader, you'll want to look to compress your timeframes. Yes, you can take advantage of the bigger swings. But you'll want to take profits when you can, because the market's more likely to experience back-and-forth action. Take what you can get, then move on!
 As for finding the absolute bottom following a market downturn, don't forget what legendary technician Walter Deemer says: ""When the time comes to buy, you won't want to."""
2024-08-07,"Title:How Does Gold Perform When Stock Markets Crash?
Article:Black-n-Blue Monday repeats gold price history so far...


              
           


STOCKS took a beating on Monday, gold less so, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault in this note first shared with Weekly Update
             subscribers amid that day's equity-market slump.


              
           

             We'll leave other pundits and analysts to guess at the ""why"" behind the almighty Black Monday slump in Tokyo (
            how about higher interest rates and a soaring Yen)...
           

              
           

             ...or the deepening slide in Chinese stocks (
            real-estate crash, mountains of bad debt, vanishing GDP growth)...
           

              
           

             ...plus the sudden panic in European and American shares (
            the Fed is late to the fast-coming recession, just like it was late to inflation 3 years ago).
           

              
           

             But for the broader sense of an ending in the long boom for US equities, try the words ""Warren Buffett"".
           

              
           

             Data published last weekend said the ancient Sage of Omaha slashed his holdings of over-priced gadget-brand Apple in half between April and June, taking profit at new record highs in AAPL as part of a $76 billion switch from stocks to cash, now at a record-high level for the Berkshire Hathaway money he runs.
           

              
           

             Buffett and his team clearly think they know something. And in a proper financial crash, ""All correlations go to 1"" as old-time traders like to put it...
           

              
           

             ...meaning that when trouble really hits the fan, everything slides together.
           

              
           

             Most times, that includes gold.
           

              
           




              
           

             Time to panic?
           

              
           

             ""Gold is behaving exactly as it should,"" said bullion-market specialist Rhona O'Connell, now at brokerage StoneX amid Monday's stock sell-off.
           

              
           

             ""[This is] normal...There has been liquidation in the face of equities weakness.
           

              
           

             ""Clients often ask why this happens, given that gold is supposed to be an insurance policy.
           

              
           

             ""The answer is that it’s doing exactly what it should and providing comfort in times of trial, but then recovering.""
           

              
           

             Put another way, global stocks on Monday lost more than 5% from the same point last month on the MSCI World Index. Gold, in contrast, continued to show a 2% gain at the start of London trade.
           

              
           

             So when leveraged traders checking their phones at breakfast (whether at home or on the beach) saw margin calls pouring in from their brokers ahead of the New York opening, it forced them to liquidate winning positions to cover their losses elsewhere.
           

              
           

             This isn't unusual. Indeed, it's how most equity crashes have played out historically.
           

              
           

             Oh sure, gold jumped on Black Monday 1987, adding 3.2% as New York's Dow Jones index sank by more than 1/5th in one session.
           

              
           

             But that gain, like that equity plunge, was pretty unique.
           

              
           

             The more common pattern in a stock-market crash is for gold to drop as equities sink. But it falls less and from higher ground before finding its floor sooner.
           

              
           

             No promises of course. But that's exactly how Black-and-Blue Monday '24 has played out so far.
           

              
           

             Take the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 for instance. Gold gained 10% that week. But the loss of a major investment bank...
           

              
           

             ...taking with it pretty much all credit and leverage in financial markets everywhere...
           

              
           

             ...then saw gold sink by more than 20% over the following 4 weeks as US equities dropped by 22%.
           

              
           

             ""That's it, gold doesn't work!"" shouted some pundits.
           

              
           

             ""Clearly gold is being suppressed!"" shouted others.
           

              
           

             But no. Gold did exactly what short-term traders needed it to do...
           

              
           

             ...offering a deep and liquid market in which to raise urgent cash.
           

              
           

             More importantly, 
            gold did exactly what investors would want it to do to, if only they took a breath (and a Valium)...
           

              
           

             ...rising across the longer-term to offset the grinding long-term losses in the stock market.
           

              
           




              
           

             Day-to-day, the price of gold shows pretty much no correlation with or against the stock market.
           

              
           

             Half the time that stocks go up or down, gold goes in the same direction.
           

              
           

             Week-to-week, the same picture. Stocks and gold have gone in the same direction exactly 50% of the time over the past 5-and-a-half decades.
           

              
           

             Pulling out to look at 52-week periods, gold has diverged from equities a little more often...
           

              
           

             ...zigging when the stock market zagged 55% of the time since 1969.
           

              
           

             But that split narrows back to less than 51% of the time when we look at the price change across all 5-year horizons, which is what our chart does above.
           

              
           

             What changes, however, is the net effect across those 5-year periods. Because while gold has very often shown a strong 5-year gain at the same time as the S&P500 has risen, it has ALWAYS risen from 5 years before when the S&P fell.
           

              
           

             To repeat (with a little nuance) and repeating 
            a clear pattern of gold prices vs. the US stock market we have noted many times before:
           

              
           

             Across the past half-century, the S&P500 price index has shown a 5-year rise in 2,130 weeks.
           

              
           

             In 1,341 of those weeks, gold also showed a 5-year rise...gaining when the US stock market gained 63.0% of the time.
           

              
           

             But when the S&P500 had fallen from 5 years before?
           

              
           

             That happened in 549 weeks. And in only 11 of them did gold also fail to show a gain from 5 years before.
           

              
           

             For reference, that 'fail' came in mid-2002, when the US stock market was still mired in the DotCom Crash...trading as much as 17% lower from mid-1997. Gold was meantime struggling with the generational lows it made in the late 1990s when European central banks dumped the stuff (because, you know, 
            history had ended). So it was trading as much as 6% lower from a half-decade before.
           

              
           

             That fail aside? On a weekly basis, gold has traded higher when the US stock market fell from 5 years earlier 98.0% of the time.
           

              
           

             Not guaranteed to work, in short. But pretty darned close when you need investment insurance to pay out.

2024-08-06,"Title:Gold Investing Rebounds as Stock Markets Crash
Article:Monday reversed 1/2 of July's profit-taking in gold...


              
           


INVESTORS again took profits on gold at new record prices in July, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault, but demand has rebounded so far this week amid the sudden crash in global stock markets.
           

              
           

             Investor selling on the world-leading marketplace last month outweighed gold buying by 152 kilograms worth over $11 million (£9m, €10m). That was the heaviest net liquidation since April and almost 5 times 
            the small net outflow of gold in June.
           

              
           

             But Monday's stock-market slump to a sudden 3-month low on the MSCI World Index, plus a steep pullback in the price of gold to 1-week lows, saw net demand on BullionVault – which cares today for 44.9 tonnes of securely stored and insured bullion worth $3.5 billion (£2.7bn, €3.2bn) for more than 100,000 users worldwide – reverse half of July's outflow in just 24 hours.
           

              
           

             With global stock markets previously setting new all-time highs throughout 2024, the combination of record-high gold prices plus high interest rates on cash worked to deter new gold demand while spurring profit-taking among existing investors.
           

              
           

             Now interest rates are falling, the stock market has crumpled, and gold has retreated from its latest peaks. That clears the way for fresh inflows into the precious metal, most especially from investors wanting to add physical bullion as long-term insurance for their wider portfolio.
           

              
           




              
           

             Ahead of this week's sudden plunge in world stock markets, the price of gold rose 4.1% in Dollar terms across July (2.1% in British Pounds, 2.7% in Euros) to set a new month-end price record in most major currencies.
           

              
           

             Those gold price gains saw the number of investors using BullionVault to start or add to their holdings slip for the 3rd month running, down to the fewest since March. The number of sellers in contrast rebounded by 51.1% from June's 12-month low.
           

              
           

             Together that pulled the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of private sentiment in physical bullion built solely from actual investment behaviour – down 1.6 points to 52.3, the lowest since April.
           

              
           

             Reading 50.0 when the number of net buyers equals the number of net sellers across the month, the Gold Investor Index hit a decade-high of 65.9 
            as online gold investment jumped when the Covid pandemic shut Western economies in March 2020. It set a series low of 47.5 this March 
            as gold investors sold when prices jumped at the fastest pace in 8 years to hit what were then all-time highs.
           

              
           

             But while BullionVault users have continued to bank at least some of their gains on gold in 2024 so far, the precious metal's price has been rising faster than investors have been selling. That has increased the value of investor gold holdings overall despite its strong run of new record highs inviting people to take profit.
           

              
           

             By weight, BullionVault users have now been net sellers of gold as a group for 11 months running, shrinking client holdings by 6.7% over that time. However, the value of those holdings has soared by 19.0% in Dollar terms (+15.0% in Sterling, +16.5% in Euros) as bullion prices have risen to new all-time highs.
           

              
           




              
           

             Silver meantime sank on Monday to 3-month lows in spot-market trading. But the price of the more industrially useful precious metal had already lost 2.7% across July (-4.2% in GBP, -3.9% in EUR) to set its lowest end-month level since April.
           

              
           

             That saw the number of people starting or adding to their securely-stored holdings of silver across the month rise 17.1% on BullionVault to the most since March 2023. While the number of net sellers rose faster, up 20.9% from June's 16-month low, that still edged the Silver Investor Index upwards by 0.4 points to 53.5, its highest reading since February last year and overtaking the Gold Investor Index for the first time since January.
           

              
           

             By weight, silver investors were net buyers as a group for the 2nd month running in July, adding another 6 tonnes to take total holdings to the highest since April at 1,167 tonnes worth $1.0 billion (£834m, €989m)."
2024-08-05,"Title:PEM's Platinum Demand Up 50-Fold by 2030
Article:Hydrogen electrolyser capacity set to surge...

 HYDROGEN serves as a versatile energy carrier, capable of being produced from renewable energy sources and applied across various mobility and industrial sectors, driving global decarbonisation efforts and facilitating the energy transition, says the World Platinum Investment Council.
 Platinum and other platinum group metals are set to play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of hydrogen production through their use in electrolysers, catalysing the production of hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy – an emissions-free process.
 Highlighting green hydrogen's potential, the immediately addressable existing hydrogen market totals 95 million tons per annum, which primarily relies on fossil fuels for its production.
 Recent research from the WPIC indicates that global electrolyser capacity will grow significantly to reach a cumulative 212 gigawatts by 2030 from just six gigawatts in 2023. Correspondingly, based on the assumption that platinum-based proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers will have a 38% share of the electrolyser market in 2030, annual platinum demand from PEM electrolysers is forecast to increase from the 4,000 Troy ounces achieved in 2023 to 229,000 ounces in 2030.
 
 Recent developments in North America highlight gathering momentum in the electrolyser market. The US has made ambitious hydrogen subsidies available through the Inflation Reduction Act, with plans being developed for ten major hydrogen hubs.
 In March, the US Department of Energy (DOE) awarded US$750 million to 52 clean hydrogen projects across 24 states to ""dramatically reduce the cost of clean hydrogen and reinforce America's global leadership in the growing clean hydrogen industry.""
 Among other aims, the projects are expected to enable US manufacturing capacity to produce ten gigawatts of electrolysers per year, enough to add annual production of 1.3 million tons of clean hydrogen per year. Canada is also making an investment tax credit available for clean hydrogen production.
 Norwegian PEM electrolyser-maker Hystar – which is currently building a four-gigawatt, fully-automated electrolyser factory in its home country – has revealed plans to expand into the North American market, establishing a multi-gigawatt factory there by 2027.
 Hystar believes that the incentives on offer in the North American market 'have created a highly favourable environment that demonstrates a clear commitment to providing our industry with much-needed certainty and financial support'.
 Meanwhile, another Norwegian electrolyser business, Nel, has received funding in the form of cash incentives and grants from both the US Department of Energy and the state of Michigan with a combined total of US$125 million in support of its plans to build a four-gigawatt electrolyser plant in Michigan. In the planned new facility, Nel will manufacture its next-generation PEM electrolyser technologies among other products.
 In May, US PEM electrolyser manufacturer Plug Power received a conditional commitment for an up to US$1.66 billion loan guarantee from the US DOE to finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities.
 With plans to operate a green hydrogen 'highway' across North America and Europe, Plug has built a state-of-the-art gigafactory to produce electrolysers and fuel cells. It is developing multiple green hydrogen production plants targeting commercial operation by year-end 2028, which will use its own PEM electrolysers."
2024-08-02,"Title:Yield Spreads? 'C'Mon In, Water's Fine'
Article:Financial market stress not in play...yet

 SO HERE is the thing, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 During a bull market or very bullish phase, indicators give the all-clear. Come on in, the water's fine! Investors are always going to be complacent and market/economic signals at least stable (or quite positive) at market tops. It's the way the markets work.
 Recall 2000 and 2007. As Steven King would say, ""nope, nothin' wrong here.""
 This chart from MacroMicro illustrates the point. During a bull phase in the markets things are fine...fine...fine...and then suddenly, out of nowhere, NOT fine. So pictures like this, tracking world financial market stress, tell us what we already know:
 The market is bullish and the waters are calm.
 
 That is why I use indications beneath the surface of things.
 From the spread between long and short-term Treasury yields (yield curves) to the spread between gold and silver (less vs. more cyclical and inflation utility), gold and copper, gold and stocks, etc.
 We want to dial in the sensitivity of indications as best as possible because it is more than likely that financial market stress indicators are going to be flashing 'just fine and dandy' at the next top. It's after the herds start to stampede that these indicators flash their ""warning"".
 So to me, financial market stress indicators are risk indicators. When they indicate 'all clear', risk is actually high. When they are alarmingly out of control to the stressful (up) side, risk is actually low. Again, it's the way markets work.
 Here is a look at US High Yield spreads, which indicate a calm, complacent backdrop when depressed and market/economic anxiety when rising.
 
 Risk is about a million miles higher today than it was in March of 2020.
 That was, by the way, the time NFTRH was getting bullish, because the herds were terrified and the Fed was printing the new bull market with all its manipulative might.
 So a combo of contrary sentiment and macro observation works well. But the macro observation has to discriminate between indications, selecting the right ones.
 Considering that market trends are up from short to long-term views, this information tells us that a committed bear case is not yet indicated in real time. But also that a mother of a bear phase is coming.
 We have our long held view of ""to or through"" the US election. But with risk this high, being prepared along the way is a good idea. Also, there is no rule that says I am right about ""to or through"" the election, as in within weeks or a few months, post-election. But that has been our primary objective to this point, and it still is."
2024-08-01,"Title:That '70s Show, Again
Article:Stagflation, political violence, wealth inequality...

 ARE WE going to be reliving the 1970s? asks Charles Hugh Smith of the OfTwoMinds blog writing for Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Perhaps we will experience the stagflation of the 1970s in this decade, as financial excesses are worked out and monumental investments to retool our industrial base and infrastructure place a drag on productivity and profits. There is substantial logic in that scenario.
 Stagflation also crushed the stock market's speculative dynamic. In the financial realm, That '70s Show was characterized by a massive devaluation of the purchasing power of stocks as a result of elevated inflation and an equally massive decay in the speculative impulse to play the stock market, as the percentage of household assets in the stock market fell from 38% to 14%.
 But what we might experience in addition to stagflation is something few seem to recall about the 1970s: the extraordinary unpredictability of events and crises. Consider the situation in April 1973, at the start of President Nixon's second term.
 Inflation had flared up, a currency crisis loomed and Nixon had issued sweeping policy changes in August 1971 ending the convertibility of the US Dollar to gold in international markets and imposing wage and price controls.
 The general outlook in early 1973 was positive, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) topped 1,000 again, reaching a new nominal high.
 If any seer predicted the oil embargo/gas crisis that pushed Americans into long lines around gas stations in October 1973, or the Watergate cover-up leading to Nixon's resignation in August 1974 or the attempt on President Ford's life in September 1975, they're unknown to the world.
 If anyone predicted a decade of anti-establishment domestic terrorism, their prediction is lost to history. The hundreds of bombings of corporate America buildings, banks and other symbolic fortresses of the establishment have been ably documented in the book Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence.
 If anyone predicted that the US Dollar would lose two-thirds of its purchasing power from 1966 to December 1981, their prediction isn't well known.
 What $1 bought at the market peak in 1966 cost $3 by December 1981, in the throes of the deepest recession since the Great Depression, a recession triggered by soaring interest rates and monetary tightening to crush the wage price spiral inflation that had become embedded in the economy by 1980.
 Note that Dow 1,000 in October 1982 was only Dow 330 when adjusted for inflation since the peak in 1966 – $1 in February 1966 equaled $3.07 in October 1982.
 From the Dow's top in January 1973 at 1,051.70 to the point when the Dow reached 1,012 in October 1982, $1 in January 1973 was $2.31 in October 1982.
 So Dow 1,000 in January 1973 meant Dow 435 in October 1982. These data points are from the CPI Inflation Calculator (BLS.gov).
 Few predicted the demise of the belief that ""stocks only go up"" and the market was a moneymaking machine available to all gamblers, oops, I mean ""investors"".
 If we propose that the 2020s will mirror the 1970s not in the precise dynamics but in the unpredictability of crises and reversals of all that is stable, known and reliable, then we cannot possibly predict what lies ahead.
 We can only anticipate twisters on the horizon that will be completely unexpected and potentially disruptive on a scale that stretches across culture, society, politics and the economy.
 If we're in a remake of That '70s Show, the plot twists – and twisters heading our way – may be far wilder than we can currently imagine. And frankly, I fear for our nation.
 That's right – I fear for our nation, and I am not alone. The echoes of the past are becoming louder, and I recall the decades between 1961 and 1981 with trepidation, for that era was marked by crisis, tumult, discord, civil violence, war, a near miss of nuclear war, extreme polarization and assassinations.
 Many Americans sense the country never really recovered from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, or from the assassinations of presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. five years later in 1968.
 An attempt on the life of President Gerald Ford was narrowly thwarted in 1975, and an attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan very nearly succeeded in 1981.
 A terrible madness swept the land, as dozens of bombings and the bizarre kidnapping of media heiress Patty Hearst by a domestic terror cell pockmarked the 1970s, a decade marked by a failed presidency, revelations of domestic spying by federal security agencies and runaway inflation.
 It was a very long night before morning dawned in America again. From the longer view, the 20 years of tumult can be understood as the political and social reaction to what changed in America in the previous 20 years of 1941-1960.
 America had been roused from isolationism to fight a world war, forced to protect allies in Europe and Asia from the threat posed by an expansionist totalitarian Soviet Union and deal with a century-old reckoning with the racial divide that made a mockery of our nation's principle that ""all men are created equal"" and should be treated equally before the law.
 The promises made by the founding documents of the nation had yet to be fulfilled.
 The very success of our protection of war-devastated allies created an economic crisis of our own, as the old, less-efficient industrial plant of America was outpaced by the new industries that arose in Germany and Japan with modern technologies, industries aided by America's open door to exports and the strong Dollar.
 The 1970s was a decade of economic adjustment with high costs to both capital and labor as the energy crisis and the need to tackle industrial pollution drove a multitrillion-Dollar (in today's Dollars) rebuilding of American industry, a process punctuated by recessions that caused great misery for those laid off and struggling with high inflation.
 These sacrifices and conflicts eventually paid dividends. Inequality eased, high interest rates crushed the inflationary spiral and the investments in higher efficiencies and new technologies started paying off.
 My fear is that we've entered another 20 years of tumult, chaotic conflict, infectious madness and discord, but without the resilience we possessed in the 1960s and 1970s, the resilience generated by low debt, strong domestic industries and supply chains, low levels of regulation, low-cost health care and education and much higher levels of civic virtue, community, national purpose, moral legitimacy and self-reliance than are visible today.
 Whether we admit it or not, we are riven by rising inequality in wealth and opportunity, high debt loads and little consensus on how to get through the night in one piece and emerge better from facing the challenges head on.
 I fear the siren-song appeal of denial and magical thinking, as if a rocket to Mars or a new phone app or another AI chatbot will fix what's broken in America.
 I fear our buffers have been thinned, and our ability to make sacrifices for the future has been lost. Our moral foundations are in such tatters that getting rich by whatever means are within reach is now the ""solution"" to the coming storm, as if greed bled dry of ethics isn't a proximate cause of the coming storm.
 My hope is that we gain the wisdom to see there are no easy solutions, no one-size-fits-all fixes, that solutions will be localized, partial, contingent on continual adaptation to changing conditions and that this continual experimentation and evolution requires an acceptance of continual failures and a keen sense of humility about our limits.
 I hope we gain the wisdom that we need each other, not as enemies but as colleagues, not always in agreement but respectful nonetheless.
 I'm hopeful, but I'm not necessarily confident."
2024-07-30,"Title:Gold Coins and Bars: Germany Sells, China and India Buy
Article:Western gold investment sinks, Asia jumps on new data...


              
           


GOLD INVESTMENT trends have diverged between Asian and Western households on 2024's fresh record prices, new data says today, with Germany – the coin-and-small-bar industry's former darling – becoming a net seller overall in April to June while retail gold investing jumped in China and India.
           

              
           

             That's according to figures compiled by specialist analysts Metals Focus and released Tuesday by the mining industry's World Gold Council.
           

              
           

             The 
            No.1 gold consumer nation China saw net demand to buy bullion coins and retail investment bars jump by more than 3/5ths year-on-year in the second quarter, setting a series record for Q2 demand outside of 2013's price crash surge.
           

              
           

             No.2 consumer India also saw a surge of 
            gold coin and small bullion-bar buying, with its net total rising by almost one-half from spring 2023.
           

              
           




              
           

             On a rolling 4-quarter basis, that means Indian households – now enjoying a marked drop in prices after 
            the BJP-led Government slashed gold import duty last week – haven't chosen to buy this much gold in the form of bullion coins and small bars since the 12 months ending September 2014.
           

              
           

             China's 4-quarter total meantime comes only 5 tonnes shy of its past decade's peak, with coin-and-bar demand reaching nearly 355 tonnes in the 12 months to June after Q2 saw mainland Chinese retail gold investing hit 80 tonnes. That was barely 6 tonnes behind China's gross demand for gold jewellery between April and June, the tightest gap since at least 2010 on the World Gold Council's 
            Gold Demand Trends data.
           

              
           

             Separate figures from the China Gold Association say coin-and-small-bar demand outstripped jewellery purchases this spring, reaching 107 tonnes versus 86 and marking a flip from adornment to investment not seen before on modern data as the world's 2nd largest economy and 2nd most populous nation faces a real estate slump, a 
            bear-market in equities, and a sharp slowdown in GDP growth.
           

              
           

             In contrast to Asia's 2 giant consumer markets, rich 
            Western economies all saw gold coin-and-small-bar demand drop in Q2 from the same period last year on today's World Gold Council figures, with households in two European markets choosing to sell and take profit overall on the precious metal's fresh all-time price highs.
           

              
           

             Australia fell 19% by weight, Japan 26%, North America 48%, and Western Europe 65%, led by a 3rd consecutive calendar quarter of net selling in France and the first such liquidation by German households since at least 2010.
           

              
           

             Between 2010 and 2022, Germany was the 3rd largest national consumer of gold coins and retail-investment bullion bars in all but 2 years, when it came second only to world No.1 China in 2020 and 2022.
           

              
           

             But last year's new record gold price in Euros, plus the return of above-zero interest rates on cash in Eurozone banks, meant that 
            Germany's demand for retail gold investment products sank by 75%, falling to 5th place behind China, India, Turkey and the United States.
           

              
           

             Germany then plunged again, down to 18th position across the first half of 2024 by showing less than 5 tonnes of net gold coin and small-bar demand, dropping behind smaller or economically poorer nations including Australia, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Thailand, Russia, Iran and Vietnam as well as gold's big four of the USA, Turkey, India and China.
           

              
           

             April-to-June saw German residents sell 2.0 tonnes more gold in the form of bullion coins and bars than they bought as a group, and 
            the selling has continued into July according to retail dealers speaking to news-site GoldReporter.de
           

              
           

             ""Customers have taken advantage of the high prices to sell precious metals again,"" says one small bar and coin dealer. 
           

              
           

             ""The renewed rise in gold prices is being used to take profit by many sellers who were too hesitant during gold's earlier rise,"" says another.
           

              
           

             The split between Western and Eastern gold investing trends also shows in bullion-backed ETF trust fund flows, with China leading small net additions to Asian-listed gold ETFs for the fourth calendar quarter in a row in Q2 2024.
           

              
           

             European and North American 
            gold ETFs in contrast have now seen investors sell more than they bought for 8 calendar quarter in succession."
2024-07-30,"Title:Trump's Bitcoin Watershed
Article:Remember when BTC was only for crooks...?

 DONALD TRUMP spoke at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville this weekend, making history as the first former US president to attend the conference and make a full-throated endorsement of Bitcoin, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 My team and I had the pleasure of joining some 8,000 other Bitcoiners to listen to Trump's speech, which I believe will be remembered as a watershed moment in the history of the digital asset.
 I'll share more details from Trump's speech below, but for now, I want you to consider how far Bitcoin has come in just the first 15 years of its existence.
 You may remember a time not so long ago when the prevailing perception of Bitcoin was that only criminals and terrorists used it. It wasn't on any institutional investor's radar. Warren Buffett famously called it ""rat poison squared"".
 How things have changed! Post-Bitcoin ETFs, the world is gradually moving toward mass adoption. Major tech companies, from MicroStrategy to Tesla, keep it on their balance sheet. In two countries so far, it's used as legal tender.
 And now a former US president is throwing his full weight behind it.
 Bitcoin's price could be ""going to the moon,"" President Trump said, and if that's the case, he ""want[s] America to be the nation that leads the way.""
 I don't think it's hyperbole to say that this year's presidential race is unlike any in modern US history – maybe ever.
 President Joe Biden's withdrawal and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, and while former President Donald Trump remains the frontrunner, the wind has certainly shifted in Harris's favor. She's managed to secure a majority of Democratic delegates, and she now has the endorsement of all top party leaders, including Barack Obama.
 Harris's campaign said it raised a jaw-dropping $200 million in the first week of her campaign, which, if true, has to be a record. Users on the online betting platform Polymarket now believe the vice president has a 38% probability of winning in November, up from just 1% just a month earlier.
 
 As a bit of trivia, Biden isn't the first sitting president to choose not to seek reelection, but he's the first to make the announcement so close to Election Day.
 Not including Richard Nixon, who quit the office outright in 1974, the last two presidents to forgo reelection were Lyndon Johnson, in 1968, and Harry Truman, in 1952.
 This political upheaval comes at a time when the US economy is sending mixed signals. On the one hand, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter hit an impressive 2.8%, beating expectations and more than doubling the growth in the first quarter.
 The S&P 500 is up about 14% this year, despite recent pullbacks as investors rotate out of high-flying tech stocks into smaller, undervalued companies. The shift appears to be partly driven by expectations of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve. 
 In any case, these positive indicators – a solid economy and stock market – typically bode well for the incumbent party, giving Harris an edge.
 However, we can't ignore the economic anxiety that many Americans are feeling right now. A recent survey by buy-now-pay-later company Affirm found that three in five Americans believe we're in a recession, even though we're not officially in one.
 Credit card payment delinquencies are also rising at a concerning rate right now as Americans' pandemic-era savings have run dry. The percentage of cardholders who are more than 30 days delinquent is at a 12-year high, while the percentage of those who are 60 days or more past due hit a new series high of around 2.6%. 
 Recently, I discussed J.D.Vance, a former venture capitalist and Trump's running mate. I indicated that Vance is likely to serve as the Trump campaign's bridge to Silicon Valley's deep pockets.
 But Harris, 59, has similar connections as well. She served as California's attorney general from 2011 to 2017 and then as senator from 2017 to 2021. As a result, she reportedly has long-term connections to Silicon Valley.
 The New York Times reports that, in past campaigns, the vice president has relied on Silicon Valley's tech elites for donations. A recent CNN headline, in fact, reads that ""Kamala Harris wants to be America's first Silicon Valley president.""
 An area I'm watching closely is the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space. As someone who's deeply involved in the sector through HIVE Digital Technologies, I believe the next administration's stance on crypto could have significant implications for this emerging and yet important asset class.
 Although Harris hasn't made any statements for or against digital currencies in the past, her team has reportedly reached out to crypto-savvy figures like Mark Cuban. The Blockchain Association, the industry's trade group, said that Harris presents a ""fresh opportunity"" to make inroads with the Democratic Party, which has historically not been as welcoming to digital assets and crypto mining as Americans on the political right have been, generally speaking.
 Trump, on the other hand, has transformed himself into the ultimate pro-Bitcoin candidate after being ""orange pilled"" by Bitcoin mining executives at his Mar-a-Lago home last month. The former president posted on his social media platform Truth Social soon after the meeting that he wants ""all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA.""
 Trump repeated the same forceful message when he spoke to an enthusiastic crowd at the Bitcoin conference. If the US didn't embrace Bitcoin technology, Trump warned, ""China will...and we cannot let China dominate.""
 Specific policy plans that Trump laid out for making the US the ""Bitcoin superpower of the world"" included drafting clear regulations, protecting the right to self-custody and dramatically increasing electricity output.
 ""We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, 'Please, please, Mr. President, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it,'"" the former president joked. He also said he would fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler ""on day one.""
 The cornerstone of Trump's plan is that the US government would hold 100% of the digital assets it has or will acquire in the future in a ""strategic Bitcoin reserve."" The government currently holds around 210,000 bitcoins, valued at over $14 billion, through law enforcement activities.
 This would set the US apart from other countries, many of which have policies on the books to sell assets confiscated during criminal investigations – assets including Bitcoin. Germany, for instance, recently completed disposing of 50,000 bitcoins, an action I predict the country will one day regret."
2024-07-29,"Title:India Gold Demand 'Up 15-40%' on Shock Cut to Import Duty
Article:Surprise after gold-smuggling surge, record price discounts...


              
           


The GOVERNMENT of India has slashed import duty on gold and silver, more than halving the incentive offered to smugglers in the precious metals' No.2 consumer market and boosting industry forecasts for this autumn's festive and wedding demand as Rupee prices drop from record highs.
           

              
           

             Last week's surprise move – announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as part a new tax simplification drive – came after 
            a decade of lobbying by India's bullion and jewelry industry was 
            repeatedly spurned by the BJP Government led by Narendra Modi and re-elected but without an outright majority in June.
           

              
           




              
           

             Now slashed from a modern-era record of 15% to just 6% for gold and silver bullion, India's heavy rate of import duty has been blamed for a surge in smuggling as well as growing exploitation of loopholes, trade agreements and tax differentials for unrefined doré and gold-plated platinum.
           

              
           

             Such 'unofficial' inflows meant that, compared to gold prices in London – heart of the precious metal's global trading and storage network – plus General Sales Tax rates of 3% and the 15% import duty, gold in India traded at a discount to the 'official' quote almost without pause since 2015 according to figures gathered and published by the mining industry's World Gold Council.
           

              
           

             That discount 
            hit a record $110 a week before Delhi's surprise move, the widest ever on WGC data starting 2012.
           

              
           

             Specialist analysts 
            Metals Focus put the pre-cut discount at $70-80 per ounce, while news agency Reuters quotes $65, the deepest discount in 6 months.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""India has become a hub for Sudanese syndicates running a booming trans-Saharan gold racket,"" says 
            The Week magazine, 
            reporting how flows from war-torn Sudan – estimated as Africa's 3rd largest gold mining nation and the 10th largest worldwide – have been smuggled by female kuruvis (meaning ""sparrows"", a slang term for human mules) flying into India from the United Arab Emirates or walking across the border from Nepal wearing gold dust or paste on their skin and swallowing or hiding gold capsules in body cavities.
           

              
           

             Other smuggling routes include fishing boats sailing between northern Sri Lanka and the south-eastern state of Tamil Nadu, the free-movement border with Myanmar, and flights from the UAE.
           

              
           

             Staff from the UAE's consulate in Kerala are among 27 accused of using diplomatic bags to smuggle almost 100 kilograms of gold into India between 2019 and 2020.
           

              
           

             A drive by the ""lean"" staff of India's Directorate of Revenue Intelligence saw national seizures of illegal gold over the 2022-2023 fiscal year reach 4 tonnes, nearly equal to the previous 2 years' combined and beating the pre-Covid year of 2019-2020 by 10%.
           

              
           

             India's Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the UAE, signed in February 2022, also meant that imports of platinum bullion were charged just 5% duty rates and needed to contain only 2% of the white metal to qualify.
           

              
           

             That loophole 
            spurred 13 tonnes of ""platinum"" consignments across the Indian Ocean in just 4 weeks to early July, beating 2023's full-year total as dealers imported platinum-plated gold.
           

              
           

             Import duty differentials between gold bullion bars and semi-refined doré had already been equalized by the New Delhi government after a failed attempt to boost India's domestic 
            bullion refining industry saw huge over-capacity in the late-2010s. But doré still accounted for nearly 28% of gross bullion inflows in 2021-2023 on Metals Focus' data for the World Gold Council, up from less than 5% in 2012-2014.
           

              
           

             In total, around 150 tonnes of last year's gross 805 tonnes of Indian gold imports were 'unofficial' – also known as 'grey' inflows – the consultancy says.
           

              
           

             ""Gold prices have fallen sharply due to a reduction in duties and a correction in global prices,"" says Harshad Ajmera, owner of wholesale dealer JJ Gold House in Kolkata. ""Many buyers who were waiting for this price drop are now entering the market.""
           

              
           

             ""Historically, when gold prices fall, consumer enthusiasm tends to increase,"" agrees Suvankar Sen, CEO of Kolkata-based $880 million stock-market listed jeweller Senco Gold Ltd. After household demand fell earlier this year in the face of new record-high gold rates, ""We 
            anticipate a 10-15% rise in sales due to lower gold prices"" ahead of the autumn's key Diwali festival and wedding season.
           

              
           

             Shares in Senco Gold (NSE: SENCO) leapt almost 10% on last Tuesday's announcement by finance minister Sitharaman, but have since fallen back while $36 billion-valued market leader Titan (NSE: TITAN) remains 5% higher and $7bn Kalyan (NSE: KALYANKJIL) trades 8% above its pre-announcement level.
           

              
           

             ""Indian jewellery demand was hit by record-high gold prices, but the duty cut will bring down prices and boost consumption,"" says Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of unlisted jewellers PNG in the western city of Pune.
           

              
           

             While the plunge in domestic gold prices means existing inventories have lost Rupee value, retailers expect the resulting jump in consumer demand will more than offset that drop, Metals Focus says.
           

              
           

             ""Most anticipate a 30-40% increase in demand from current levels."""
2024-07-26,"Title:Olympic Medals: The Real Gold, Silver & Bronze Medal Count
Article:As Paris 2024 begins, here's the Olympics' real gold, silver and bronze medal count at current prices...
           

              
           


The PARIS OLYMPICS opening ceremony is just hours away, and as we wait to see how our home nations fare in summer 2024, we began thinking about the value of the medals awarded to first, second and third place winners.
           

              
           

             It’s no surprise that the USA, of all the nations competing in the modern games, has won the greatest number of Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals – a staggering 2,637 medals to date from the summer Olympics.
           

              
           

             That's more than a 1,000 more than the second-placed USSR and Russia combined. 
           

              
           

             But what is America's pile of gold, silver and bronze medals worth in monetary value? Our updated infographic looks at the bullion value of each nation's summer Olympics medals.
           

              
           

             You can't simply count the total, find their weight, and multiply by the current live price however.
           

              
           

             Paris's 2024 medals, for instance are the same 8.5cm in diameter as the recent Tokyo, Rio and London medals. But unlike some of their predecessors, each medal in Paris is a uniform 9.2mm thick.
           

              
           

             More significant, the 2024 gold, silver and bronze Paris medals each contain 18 grams of iron from the Eiffel Tower. Excluding that near-valueless additional weight, if the French Games' gold medal was made of pure gold, it would weigh almost 1 kilogram and at current prices would be worth almost £60,000 ($77,000 or €71,000).
           

              
           

             But instead, the 
            Chaumet designed 529-gram mix of silver (95.5%), wrought iron (3.4%) and a little gold (1.1%, some 6 grams) would set you back £1,183 ($1,528 or €1408) in the wholesale metal markets right now.
           

              
           

             Indeed, when it comes to gold medals, only two of the 30 summer sporting events since the ancient Greek games were revived have given each winner a prize of that most precious metal.
           

              
           

             The first modern games, held in Athens in 1896, didn't give gold at all to first place, but awarded a silver medal instead (plus an olive wreath), with second-place runners up receiving a copper-based bronze medallion.
           

              
           

             The next games, Paris 1900, set the trend for gilding silver with gold to award as first prize. Only the next two games, St.Louis 1904 and London 1908, awarded a true gold medal to Olympic winners.
           

              
           

             Since then, Olympic gold medals have in fact been mostly silver – gilded with a layer of gold – while silver medals also typically contain a small quantity of copper to help harden them, too. And while the metallic composition has changed a little across the years, 
            the size and shape of Olympic medals has varied widely.
           

              
           

             Typically round, medals at Paris 1900 were instead rectangular, and Stockholm 1912 prizes were oval. The thinnest medals were awarded in Stockholm in 1956 (where 
            just the equestrian events took place, while the other games were hosted on the other side of the world in Melbourne), measuring only 2.5 millimetres in depth. The fattest were awarded in Barcelona in 1992, with a depth of almost 1 centimetre.
           

              
           

             In 1908 London awarded the smallest diameter medal so far at only 3.5cm. The UK's tight-fistedness of 116 years ago is understandable, as London 1908 was one of only two modern Olympics to award a genuine gold medal to first-place winners. Weighing 72 grams (2.3 Troy ounces) its metal content would be worth £4,336 at July 2024 prices ($5,605 or €5,164).
           

              
           

             Tokyo 2020's (held in 2021) super-sized medals made them the 
            heaviest-ever summer Olympic medals. Designed by Junichi Kawanishi, they gave first-place winners 556 grams of gilt silver!
           

              
           

             There aren't any reliable, comprehensive data available for the exact metallic composition of more than a handful of the different medals designed, cast and awarded at the 30 games held since the modern Olympics began 128 years ago.
           

              
           

             So in BullionVault's sortable table below, for each medal haul outside those two solid-gold years of 1904 and 1908, we've applied the composition used for the gold, silver and bronze medals awarded at London 2012.
           

              
           

             That means:
           

              
           

             •
             Gold medals are 1.34% gold, 92.5% silver, and 6.16% copper;
           

             •
             Silver medals are 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper;
           

             •
             Bronze medals are 97% copper, 2.5% zinc and 0.5% tin.
           

              
           

             Being far more silver than gold means that overall, the total value of medals awarded in the modern games is still worth a whopping £4,441,940 ($5,739,425 or €5,290,019) at current metal prices. Using the same calculations, the United States has a total medal haul worth $1,307,417 (£1,011,751 or €1,204,823).

 No one seriously disputes the importance of China to the global economy. It's the world's second-largest economy after the US and accounts for 17% of global GDP (or an even larger per centage if one uses an alternative accounting method called purchasing power parity).
 It has the world's second-largest population at 1.41 billion people, just slightly behind India. It has the third-largest landmass in the world behind Russia and Canada. China also has the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal after Russia and the US
 But size can be deceptive. Most observers translate China's large economy into the status of global superpower soon to surpass the US in economic and military strength.
 That extrapolation has been a chimera for some time. In reality, China's economy is fragile and weakening by the day.
 China may soon find itself in economic turmoil including a credit crisis, currency crisis and economic recession all at the same time. Following is a close look at China's inherent weakness. Unfortunately for US investors, China's problems threaten to drag the global economy down with it.
 China's economic problems exist at two levels – the long-term macro level and the short-term technical level. Let's consider these in order: At the long-term level, China is confronting three material obstacles – the middle-income trap, declining demographics and wasted investment.
 The middle-income trap afflicts developing economies that have reached the middle-income level of about $10,000 per capita annually. Moving from low-income (about $5,000 per capita annually) is straightforward.
 Countries move populations from rural to urban environments, build suitable housing and infrastructure, attract direct foreign investment with cheap labor and low operating costs, engage in assembly-type manufacturing and run significant trade surpluses by exporting the manufactured goods.
 The difficulty is in moving from middle-income to high-income ($20,000 per capita annually or higher). For that, low value-added manufacturing isn't enough. It's necessary to move to high-tech, high value-added manufacturing, which requires original research and development and access to high-tech tools such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
 China has acquired some of these tools through theft of intellectual property, but not enough. China also faces fierce competition from those already engaged in high-tech manufacturing including Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Japan.
 Only a handful of countries have ever made the move from middle-income to high-income, including those just mentioned. Many more including Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, India and South Africa are stuck in the same middle-income trap as China.
 The prospects of China breaking out of the middle-income bracket are slim, especially now that foreign direct investment is moving toward India and Vietnam and away from China. This conundrum alone is enough to put the brakes on Chinese growth.
 China is also confronted with what will become the greatest demographic disaster since the Black Death in the 14th century. This is the bitter fruit of China's one-child policy from 1980-2015 combined with mass infanticide of girls. The demographic challenge is increased by greater educational and career opportunities for women, which impacts family formation, and an historic shift in the role of the family.
 China's population may decline from 1.41 billion to 750 million over the next 50 years. That's a loss of over 650 million people.
 Considering that one definition of GDP is working-age population x productivity, it follows that China's GDP will suffer a spectacular decline over the remainder of this century. (Note: The total GDP will decline but per capita GDP may be maintained because the population itself is shrinking.)
 Finally, China has wasted much of the wealth it did earn during the past 30 years with bad investments in unneeded infrastructure. A mature economy devotes about 25% of GDP to new investment (plant, equipment, homes, transportation, etc.) and about 65% to consumption. (The remaining 10% is split between trade surpluses or deficits and government spending.)
 In China, that split is reversed. About 45% of GDP goes to investment and only about 25% goes to consumption.
 That amount of investment can lead to high productivity gains in the future if it is spent intelligently on essential infrastructure, transportation, high-tech plants and equipment as well as research and development.
 Instead, China wasted the money on ""ghost cities"" (ample infrastructure with no residents or business tenants) and extravagant white elephants such as the Nanjing South train station, which has marble walls and 128 escalators but very few train passengers.
 Such show projects do produce short-term jobs and demand for copper, glass, steel and aluminum. But when the project is finished, the jobs disappear (unless diverted to another wasteful project) and the infrastructure is nonproductive with high maintenance costs.
 If Chinese GDP were adjusted for losses due to wasted investment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the reported growth figures of the past 30 years would have been reduced 20% or more. Those losses are real whether the figures are adjusted or not.
 Based on these three factors – the middle-income trap, declining demographics and wasted investment – the so-called Chinese miracle has turned into a dead end.
 China's failing growth engine is not due solely to these long-term factors. Among the short-term headwinds to growth are an excessive debt-to-GDP ratio, a drying up of direct foreign investment, a Dollar shortage and a rapidly declining currency.
 Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have demonstrated that debt-to-GDP ratios in excess of 90% will reduce the Keynesian multiplier of additional debt-financed government spending below 1.0.
 This means that for economies in that condition, if they borrow a Dollar and spend a Dollar, they receive less than a Dollar of added GDP. Of course, this process drives the ratio even higher (since the GDP denominator grows more slowly than the debt numerator), which slows growth even further.
 In plain language, you can't borrow your way out of a debt crisis.
 China has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, well over 300%. (Much of this debt is buried at the provincial level or in state-controlled banks rather than sovereign bonds, but the debt/growth dynamic is the same.) This debt overhang will retard Chinese growth independent of the other factors mentioned in this article.
 Because of trade wars, tariff wars and deteriorating Chinese-US relations, direct foreign investment is being diverted from China to other high-growth centers, including India. China's ample (but declining) labor force cannot be productive without foreign direct investment to fund state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and new technology.
 China is doomed to stagnate along the lines of the former Soviet Union without a continual supply of new capital and technology.
 China's Dollar-denominated trade surpluses cannot fill the gap because those reserves are needed to service Dollar-denominated debt of Chinese state-owned enterprises and to prop up Chinese bank balance sheets.
 That's the real reason why Chinese holdings of US Treasury securities are declining. It's not because China is ""dumping"" Treasuries. It's because China must sell the Treasuries to obtain Dollars to prop up its debts and to deal with a global Dollar shortage.
 All of these negative trends are expressed in the rapid decline of the USD/CNY exchange rate. After hitting an interim peak of 7.10 to $1.00 on Jan. 31, 2024, the Chinese Yuan broke through a central bank target of 7.25 in mid-June and is now trading at 7.27. CNY will continue this decline, perhaps hitting 7.30 to $1.00 in the weeks ahead.
 A crashing currency is not as advantageous for exports as many imagine since China's value added on exports is only about 5%. It has to import most of the inputs it uses to manufacture exports from Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.
 A declining currency increases the cost of those imports and reduces China's competitiveness. It also makes foreign direct investment less attractive and hurts China's efforts to move to a consumer economy by causing inflation on imported goods.
 It would be a serious matter if China were slowing rapidly and the problems were confined to China. They're not. Slower growth in China hurts Japanese banks, which are heavily invested there. It hurts South Korean, Taiwanese and Australian exporters that rely on Chinese markets.
 It also contributes to a global slowdown that's already affected Germany, France, Japan and the UK And it hurts US investors who are facing a wave of company failures and bond defaults.
 The US won't be insulated from this global slowdown that threatens to become a global recession and financial crisis. I believe US investors should dump Chinese stocks and ETFs and reduce equity holdings generally.
 We're entering another ""cash is king"" stage with China leading the way."
2024-07-23,"Title:William Blake's 'Birmingham'
Article:Mind-forged manacles in the Midlands...

 IF YOU'RE not familiar with the name Anthony Daniels, you might know him by his nom de plume Theodore Dalrymple, says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 Under that name he writes for, among other titles, the UK's Daily Telegraph and The Spectator.
 Daniels is a now a retired prison doctor and psychiatrist, but also a profoundly gifted writer and thinker. He recently asked whether our society is broken, and his argument would tend to conclude in the affirmative.
 One example he cites is of a single mother in Birmingham, living on welfare in a house with her three small children. Outside, is a garden littered with domestic rubbish. Daniels asks the mother whether it might not be a good idea to clear the rubbish so that her children can play freely in the garden without risk of injury or disease. She replies that she's called the council but, as yet, nobody has bothered to come round.
 Daniels goes on to cite a phrase from a poem by the great English writer William Blake. The poem in question is 'London':
 ""In every cry of every Man, In every Infants cry of fear, In every voice: in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear...""
 Those ""mind-forg'd manacles"" are iron chains of our own casting.
 John Milton makes a similar point in 'Paradise Lost' when he has the Devil, having been cast down to Hell, suggesting (perhaps somewhat disingenuously, as his intent is to goad on the other fallen angels to resume battle with God):
 ""The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.""
 In any event, as both these quotations strongly suggest, the overwhelming thing that can make the difference in our lives is not so much our circumstances but our attitude.
 To put it another way, mental toughness counts for a lot. It's not the dog in the fight, so much as the fight in the dog.
 This is the point made by Morgan Housel in his excellent presentation 'What other industries teach us about investing'. The story of Grace Grahner is instructive (emphasis ours):
 ""Grace Grahner was born in 1909, just right outside of Chicago nearby. And she had kind of a hard life. She was orphaned as a child, she began her career in the bottom of the Great Depression. Finally found a career as a secretary, where she worked her entire life. Never married, never had kids, never learned how to drive a car. Lived almost her entire life in a one room house, not far from here.
 ""By all accounts, she was a lovely lady, but lived kind of a sad life. And Grace Grahner died in 2010, she was 100 years old. And everyone who knew her was completely shocked to learn, when she died, that she had seven million Dollars to her name, that she left all of it to charity, and that began kind of a search among the people who knew her, that said, 'How does this humble secretary accumulate seven million Dollars?' And her secret was, she really had no secret at all. She saved what little she could, she put it in the stock market, she let it compound for 80 years and that was it, end of story.
 ""The second investor I want to talk about today is a guy named Richard. Save his last name, because you're not supposed to criticize people in public. Although I do a lot. Richard had almost the exact opposite background of Grace Grahner. Born into a wealthy family, went to the University of Chicago, got his MBA at Harvard Business School, went to work on Wall Street, worked his way up at some of the biggest investment firms, became the vice chairman of one of the largest investment banks and without exaggerating was one of the most powerful people in global finance.
 ""The day after Grace Grahner died, Richard filed for personal bankruptcy. He told the bankruptcy judge that the financial crisis completely wiped him out, he had no more assets, no more income and he was fighting to save foreclosure on his house. And what's interesting about these stories, I think, is that in no other industry except finance are those stories possible. There's no other industry in which someone with no education, no background and no experience can vastly outperform someone with the best background, the best education, the best experience.
 ""It's unthinkable that Grace Grahner could have performed heart surgery better than a Harvard-educated cardiologist, or built a skyscraper better than the best construction company. It's completely unthinkable that that could ever happen, but it happens in investing. And what I think it shows is that investing is not necessarily about what you know, it's about how you behave.""
 For avid consumers of news, it's difficult not to get wholly disillusioned by the headlines at present. Conflict in Ukraine and Gaza rumbles on; politics globally is a chaotic hot mess; many financial markets remain horribly expensive, and the US debt dynamic looks downright dreadful.
 The ability to remain calm, patient and, we might say, somewhat ""stoical"" is not evenly distributed among investors.
 What Morgan Housel might well have said is that successful long-term investing is really about a straightforward binary decision between maths and magic. You can believe in maths (ie, that the underlying profits of a successful business, over time, will broadly be matched by subsequent shareholder returns), or you can believe in the magic that goes with any number of plausible-sounding narratives involving growth stocks which absolves them of having to justify any remotely sensible investing metric whatsoever.
 If you believe that anything is possible when it comes to technology companies or web-based companies or new media companies, you will be willing to pay any kind of earnings multiple to own the likes of Nvidia. Naturally, we prefer to follow the maths, and then just wait for the miracle of compounding to work its own inexorable charm on future shareholder returns.
 And the beauty of true value stocks (as opposed to faddish but speculative growth stories) is that if they get cheaper, you can buy more of them without having to be too concerned that may in fact be catching a falling knife. Value helps stop you from overpaying.
 As the result of a serendipitous collision on Twitter (now X), we recently read William Manchester and Paul Reid's magnificent biography of Winston Churchill, 'The Last Lion'. This is, quite simply, the best biography we have ever read.
 Not just because Churchill is surely one of the most interesting men ever to have lived, or because he played a pivotal role in our country's defence against Adolf Hitler in the Second World War, but because it is written with a sense of the vast sweep of history, culture and human nature, not least the enduring human spirit against adversity.
 The books (there are three volumes in total, running each to over 800 pages) are a fascinating history lesson about the society of Victorian and Edwardian England and the broader world of Churchill's time.
 Even though we know from the vantage point of the 21st century how the history of the Second World War plays out, 'The Last Lion' is so well-written, so grippingly ""in the moment"" with a wealth of sourced material, that it almost manages to persuade you, as you read it, that our country's fate could yet be in the balance.
 The best history is always fascinating. 'The Last Lion' provokes some intriguing counterfactuals. If Britain had had a more informed and aggressive government during the 1930s appeasement crisis, could war have been averted? If Churchill had not been installed in 1939, could we have won the war without him? (We happen to think not, but the question bears asking.)
 Bear in mind that Britain fought essentially alone for two years, haemorrhaging blood and treasure, while we waited desperately for the US to come in on our side. If the Japanese had not invaded Pearl Harbour, Franklin D. Roosevelt, fighting his own domestic pacifists and isolationists, might not have joined the fight when he did, and the course of the war might have been very different. Or if Hitler had not pursued the grotesque folly of invading Russia.
 As an alumnus, Churchill gave a speech at Harrow School in October 1941. Within it, this extract is particularly important (emphasis added):
 ""You cannot tell from appearances how things will go. Sometimes imagination makes things out far worse than they are; yet without imagination not much can be done. Those people who are imaginative see many more dangers than perhaps exist; certainly many more than will happen; but then they must also pray to be given that extra courage to carry this far-reaching imagination. But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period – I am addressing myself to the School – surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson:
 ""Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never – in nothing, great or small, large or petty – never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.
 ""We stood all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone and finished and liquidated.
 ""Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.""
 There are countless occasions during the third volume of 'The Last Lion' – ""Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965"" – when a reader totally unfamiliar with the history of the Second World War could plausibly think: well, that's it, they're finished. People have short memories. Especially when they're not taught history.
 Hitler's blitzkrieg carved through country after country in Europe like a hot knife through soft butter. The evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, alone, now seems nothing short of miraculous.
 And then you come to appreciate that the only way Britain could possibly have survived as a combatant power was when Hermann Göring, as commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, made the fatal (for Germany, at any rate) tactical error of diverting German air raids from our air fields – where the RAF was a matter of hours from complete obliteration – and focusing them on our cities and ports instead. This alone, with the benefit of hindsight, may have been one of the greatest military blunders of the war.
 It is difficult to read this superb book without succumbing to moments of high emotion. Here, for example, is Manchester and Reid's account of those German raids on our air fields:
 ""Churchill followed the day's fighting from No.11 Group headquarters at Uxbridge, and he left clearly affected. Climbing into his limousine with Ismay, he said, 'Don't speak to me. I'm too moved.' His lips were trembling. They rode in silence for a few minutes. Then Churchill turned to Ismay and said something that 'burned into' Ismay's mind, so much so that he went home that night and repeated the words to his wife.
 ""Five days later, when the most difficult and dangerous period in the battle was about to begin, Churchill paused during a long address to the House of Commons on the overall war situation, and delivered his tribute to the RAF:
 ""The gratitude of every home in our island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge of mortal danger, are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and their devotion.""
 ""Then, he spoke the words that had so moved Ismay:
 ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.""
 Two final suggestions. Per Dalrymple, Blake and Milton, the biggest threat facing us – in the worlds of the real as well as the narrowly financial – is the threat we create within our own minds. Secondly, whatever political and economic challenges our world does face, it makes sense to try and be courageous about them, or at the very least, stoical. As Churchill himself said,
 ""I am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else."""
2024-07-22,"Title:Economies Must Hibernate
Article:But a debt-based economy can't rest...

 HERE is the central difficulty of economists, says Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 They are not women and men of science.
 They believe they are. Yet they are not.
 ""Science"" binds back to the Latin scientia – knowledge – ""to know"".
 The practitioner of the astronomical sciences, for example, is merely out to comprehend the universe he infests.
 He is not out to change or influence it. He is not out to engineer it. He is merely out to study it.
 What he is after is knowledge.
 Now consider practitioners of the economic ""sciences"".
 The heaping majority are not after knowledge for its own sake – unlike the astronomer. They are instead out to tinker...to meddle...to engineer...in pursuit of a cherished result.
 What is that cherished result? The answer is generally an expansion of the gross domestic product.
 ""Growth, growth, growth!"" is their eternal mandate.
 Thus the economic apparatus must hum perpetually at a very high pitch.
 If it slackens, if it sheds steam, if it wobbles, the economic engineers leap immediately to action. They will not permit the thing to go along on its own.
 Thus their skulls are scenes of dizzying and delirious neurological activity. They whir with prescriptions to elevate the economic level, to elevate consumption, to elevate investment.
 To this end they suppress interest rates. They fabricate oceans of credit – that is, debt – from the great abysm of nothingness.
 They seek to bend economic law to their defiant and hubristic will. That is, they do not simply observe the economic laws at work upon the human subject.
 Thus they are not scientists. They are engineers. And their engineering is nearly always botchwork.
 Imagine converting a heavenly observer – an astronomer – to a heavenly engineer.
 That is, stuff his head with the economist's aspirations. Here is what he will tell you:
 ""We have established that the gravitational constant is inadequate to our economic needs. If we can simply alter this so-called constant through wise, applied intervention, we could expect a 10% annual increase to GDP. We must therefore rearrange the gravitational constant to produce the desired economic result.""
 Here you have the psychology of an economist. It is not the psychology of a scientist.
 Now imagine that the astronomer acquires the tools of manipulation in his sphere...that the economist has acquired in his.
 He can distort gravity, he can alter the planetary orbits and the like.
 Within no time the planets would be veering from their courses, the stars would go plummeting, entire galaxies would be set upon collision courses.
 After all: Look what his economist counterpart has inflicted upon this world.
 Because of his counsel it is a world deluged by debt, financial fragility and related evils.
 We are infinitely fortunate that the means of astronomical manipulation remain beyond human reach.
 Here is a point the economist must consider...
 When he ceases to merely observe a thing, in this instance an economy – and attempts to influence it – it is no longer the same thing.
 It is now an economy under intervention. The economist has transformed it from its original condition. It has become an instrument of politics – and the perpetual cry for growth.
 Yet must an economy be slave to growth?
 Nature runs to cycles. The tides wax and wane, animals hibernate, the seasons roll into one another.
 Left undisturbed, an economy likewise runs to the cyclical orientation.
 Why not let it?
 If an economy enters hibernation, permit it to enter hibernation. It will emerge with energetic vigor when the time is proper. It will be keen to get going.
 Meantime, the economy under habitual intervention is forever denied the rest and recuperation it requires.
 And so it can merely gutter along under chronic fatigue.
 Let us revisit – briefly – the Great Financial Crisis.
 The Federal Reserve intervened massively to cage the menace of depression after the 2008 wobbles. Quantitative easing, zero interest rates and the rest of the central banker's emergency kit came to bear.
 The heroics ""worked"". And the menace passed.
 What if the Fed didn't intervene? Yes, the central bank may have saved the present with its emergency medicine. Yet its medicine worked a massive heist of the future.
 Absent gargantuan intervention, interest rates would have likely soared in the crisis' wake. Many businesses reliant upon cheap debt and low interest rates would have died the death. Yet the pain – though acute – would have likely been brief.
 Sound business erected upon sound foundations would have endured. The economy would have entered the hibernatory state, yes. Yet higher interest rates would have encouraged savings...and gradually rebuilt the capital stock.
 Hibernation would have ended. The economy would emerge with fresh, rested legs and a vast energy reserve.
 It was not to be.
 The Federal Reserve denied the economy its necessary hibernation. Because, alas, our debt-based economic order cannot grant hibernation. It requires perpetual expansion in order to service the perpetual accumulation of debt it spawns.
 That is precisely why this preposterous system requires ""growth, growth, growth"".
 And so we are set eternally upon the hamster wheel.
 Daily Reckoning contributor Charles Hugh Smith:
 ""Borrowing money to consume something in the present brings forward consumption and income...
 ""If we choose to consume now, we have less income to save for future consumption or investments. If we sacrifice consumption today, we have more money in the future for consumption or investing...
 ""Those who brought their consumption forward can no longer add to present consumption, as their future income is already spoken for...
 ""A 'recovery' based...on cheap credit and an artificially stimulated 'wealth effect' was inherently weak, for the stimulus effectively hollowed out the productive economy in favor of the financialized, speculative economy...stripping future demand to create the illusion of growth in a stagnating economy...""
 Let us return to our scientific theme.
 We propose that economists observe economies as the astronomer observes the celestial realms.
 They must abandon their engineering experiments at once.
 Once economists assumed their exclusively observational role...the economic system would restore to a pink state of health...which the engineers claim is the very purpose of their interventions.
 That is because an independent economy is a self-repairing economy. It is not given to the fantastic imbalances and distortions of the economy under intervention.
 And the greater the intervention, the greater requirement for greater intervention to address the high distortions of the original intervention...
 And the greater the magnitude of the next crisis...which requires greater intervention yet.
 It is a cycle truly vicious.
 Thus it is time to banish the economists – and to the outmost darkness."
2024-07-18,"Title:Gold Miners: Planets Slowly Align
Article:Economic slowdown continues, priming mining stocks...

 PRIVATE PAYROLLS were the latest weak number amid slow economic deceleration, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 We anticipated Goldilocks back in Q4 2022 to Q1 2023 but she has been more intense and longer lasting than I originally expected. Fast forward to Q4 '23 to Q1 '24, and it dawned on me that ""Duh, it's an election year"" and a mighty divisive and important one at that.
 We then factored some of the ways that the Biden administration would try to retain power (poor old Joe wilting at the debate most certainly not among them).
 What was/is among those ideas is proposed jiggering of interest rates by the GSEs (government sponsored lending entities), Semiconductor CHIPS and other re-shoring initiatives in an increasingly contentious global economic battlefield of EV/Green initiatives, roads, bridges and whatever else they can get their debt soaked hands on.
 Not to mention government hiring, which we've noted every month (except April) has been disproportionately large.
 Imagine that! A government slipping deeper into sublime levels of debt, hiring more. Sounds about right.
 Here again is the $34 trillion bag of debt that is being leveraged to support GDP:
 
 The point is that the economy has been propped up by various means while embedded Healthcare and Educational services hiring continue and Leisure & Hospitality services continue to boom.
 I assume much of this is the beneficiaries of inflation having cashed out some of their equity and livin' it up. But insofar as Payrolls are positive you can bet that the lower-wage services sector is gainfully participating.
 ADP's Private Payrolls report reflected another little tick toward economic contraction. Economic contraction is our favored theme for the gold stock sector. The upcoming rally aside, I am not at all convinced the relatively minor correction (within a larger bull market) is over.
 But as the economy decelerates, inflation signals fade and gold outdoes most everything else (which may have to wait until Q4 or Q1 of 2025) we will finally have the leverage that most gold bugs believe will never come back to the gold mining sector.
 Let's see how economic and market signals progress over the next few months.
 In the short-term I believe the gold stock sector is working off the excesses of the first leg of a rally that I think will break the post-2020 consolidation/correction.
 In the longer-term, a backdrop not unlike the post-bubble early 1930s may grind into place (prior to the next inflation problem). In the short-term I would think a lot will have to do with whether or not, barring a miracle revival by Joe, the Biden administration simply rolls over and expires or the democrat party pulls a white knight out of its hat to replace him and regain momentum.
 If the administration simply expires, the concern for the economy would be whether all or some of the debt funded initiatives noted in the second paragraph would expire as well. If Trump looks imminent, I would not put it past the Democrats to willingly leave him with a giant and deflating mess on his hands.
 
 Meanwhile, we have not beheld the gold mining Macrocosm in a long time, because the inflationary backdrop has been anti-gold mining.
 Space is vast and is on no one's particular time frame. But we are in progress."
2024-07-17,"Title:Silver Deficit, Gold $2700, and the Coming Oil Glut
Article:Reviewing H1 2024's commodity winners...

 IF YOU were in charge of the Fourth of July spread this holiday, you probably noticed a hike in prices, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, the cost of a typical Independence Day spread for 10 people jumped to $71.22 this year, up 5% from last year and a whopping 30% from five years ago.
 That may not seem like much, but this inflation has a compounding effect on commodities.
 Research from Goldman Sachs shows that a 1 per centage point increase in US inflation has historically led to a real return gain of 7 per centage points for commodities. Meanwhile, the same trigger caused stocks and bonds to decline by 3 and 4 per centage points, respectively.
 This data supports the potential of commodities as an inflation hedge. In times of rising prices, having exposure to tangible assets like silver, oil and gold often retain their value better than paper assets.
 The reason I mention silver, oil and gold is because they were the top performing commodities in the first half of 2024. Let's dive into what's driving these trends and what they might mean for investors.
 Leading the charge is silver, up close to 22.5% in the first half. The ""poor man's gold"" is proving its worth, driven by a global supply deficit and increasing demand.
 
 Back in January, the Silver Institute forecasted that global silver demand will reach a near-record 1.2 billion ounces in 2024, up 1% from last year. This growth is primarily fueled by industrial applications, particularly in the booming solar energy sector.
 We're looking at the fourth consecutive year of a structural market deficit in silver. The deficit is expected to widen by 17%, reaching 215.3 million ounces. Loyal readers should be aware of what happens when demand outstrips supply – prices tend to rise.
 Oil, our second top performer with a gain of 13.8%, continues to demonstrate its staying power in the global economy. Despite the push for electrification, oil demand remains robust.
 According to a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), we're approaching a significant turning point. Global oil demand, which averaged just over 102 million barrels per day in 2023, is expected to level off near 106 million barrels per day toward the end of this decade. This plateau in demand coincides with a projected surge in global oil production, particularly from non-OPEC+ producers.
 
 The implications of this forecast are profound. We're looking at a future where oil supplies could reach levels of abundance unseen outside of the pandemic. This potential oversupply situation could exert downward pressure on oil prices.
 It's worth noting that the IEA's outlook contrasts with some other forecasts. Goldman Sachs Research, for instance, expects oil demand to continue growing until 2034, potentially reaching 110 million barrels a day. They cite increasing demand from emerging Asian markets and the petrochemical industry as key drivers.
 Last but certainly not least is gold. The yellow metal has shone brightly in 2024, rising 12.8% year-to-date and outperforming many major asset classes. This performance is particularly impressive given the high interest rates and strong US Dollar – conditions that ordinarily create a challenging environment for gold.
 What's behind the metal's resilience? It's a perfect storm of factors: continued central bank buying, strong Asian investment flows, steady consumer demand and persistent geopolitical uncertainties. In its midyear outlook, the World Gold Council (WGC) estimates that central bank demand alone contributed at least 10% to gold's performance in 2023 and potentially around 5% so far this year.
 Looking ahead, Goldman has set a bullish target of $2700 per troy ounce for gold by year-end. That's an increase of about 16% from current levels. They cite solid demand from emerging market central banks and Asian households as key drivers.
 Many investors, myself included, appreciate gold's potential as a hedge against both inflation and geopolitical risks. It could provide a buffer against potential stock market volatility, especially if trade tensions escalate. Additionally, gold might see further upside if concerns about the US debt load increase or if there's a shift in Federal Reserve policy under a new administration.
 As we move into the second half of 2024, the commodities market continues to offer intriguing opportunities. Silver's industrial demand, particularly in the green energy sector, presents a compelling growth story. Oil remains a critical resource, especially for emerging economies, despite the global push towards renewables. And gold, the eternal safe haven, continues to prove its worth in uncertain times."

Article:What Trump's assassination attempt means next...

 ALL Americans should be relieved and grateful that Donald Trump survived an attempted assassination at a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Elections should be decided at the ballot box, not through violence. Of course, there are many on the political left who celebrated the assassination attempt. Their only regret is that it failed. But most Americans are happy that the attempt failed.
 We can only speculate about what might have happened if Trump were killed. It would be a very different America today. We could have seen outrage, riots and threats of reprisal. It's frightening to contemplate.
 Let's break it all down...
 Trump was grazed by a bullet fired by the shooter Thomas Crooks. The shooter was killed seconds after shooting Trump, but not before firing multiple rounds at Trump and the crowd.
 Our prayers go out to Corey Comperatore, a rally participant who was shot and killed by Crooks while trying to shield his family from the killer's bullets. We also pray for Comperatore's family and others critically wounded by the shooting.
 We know some of the pertinent facts, but there's far more we don't know. The shooter used an AR-15-style rifle with 5.56 mm rounds and fired from an adjacent rooftop at a distance of about 150 yards.
 The AR-15 is a highly accurate rifle, the 5.56 mm is a high-pressure bullet, and 150 yards is a relatively short distance for any experienced shooter. I've fired the same weapon with the same ammo at that distance. The rifle is accurate with low recoil. A longer-barrel sniper-type weapon is not needed to hit a target at that relatively short distance.
 Trump was grazed in the ear by one bullet, which led to bleeding but miraculously was not worse. Still, the bullet came within a few millimeters of being a fatal headshot. Trump turned his head away from the shooter's aim a split second before the bullet hit.
 If Trump turned his head a split second earlier, the shooter could have adjusted his aim. If he turned his head a split second later, it would have been too late and the bullet would have penetrated his skull.
 The resulting overpressure inside his skull would have likely resulted in a mortal wound, similar to the wound that killed JFK, which was put on graphic display in the famous Zapruder film.
 Sadly, others were killed and critically wounded as Crooks continued to fire. Finally, a police sniper on a rooftop close to Trump shot Crooks in the head and he died on the scene with his murder weapon at hand.
 Trump's reflexes after being shot were remarkable. He ducked beneath the bulletproof podium for cover as Secret Service officers piled on top of him as human shields. Once the shooting stopped and the area was deemed clear, Trump got back on his feet looking disheveled and slightly dazed but still focused. As he was being escorted off the stage by the Secret Service,
 Trump pumped his fist in the air and shouted, ""Fight,"" to the crowd. This was an amazing display of strength, courage and presence of mind and gave encouragement both to the rally attendees and a global TV audience.
 The image of Trump raising his fist and addressing the crowd, with blood splashed across his face, will go down as one of the most iconic images in American political history.
 Trump was rushed to a hospital, treated and then released. He was back at his Bedminster, New Jersey, estate Saturday evening and was actually on the golf course by Sunday morning. He's now on his way to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to attend the Republican National Convention.
 The convention itself is proceeding as planned, including the announcement of Trump's choice for vice president, J.D.Vance.
 That's what we know. The list of things we don't know is much longer.
 It's critical not to jump to conclusions, but it's not too soon to ask some hard questions. Here's the list:
 Why on Earth was the shooter's position not occupied by the Secret Service? It's an obvious vantage point and potential sniper nest. Even an amateur knows that, let alone the Secret Service. This was a security failure of the utmost magnitude that can't be overstated. It was that bad.
 A number of witnesses have said they saw the shooter climbing up the roof with his rifle. They warned the local police and Secret Service with minutes to spare. Nothing was done. Why not?
 The police snipers on the roof closest to Trump spotted the shooter in their scopes. They kept him in sight but did not kill him as should have been required under the circumstances. Once the shooter opened fire, the police snipers killed him but not before five or six shots were fired including the one that hit Trump. Why the delay?
 Some unverified reports say that the Secret Service refused to permit the police snipers to kill the assassin before the shooting began. That's possible, but we don't know at this point.
 It's also possible that the snipers were awaiting word on the shooter's identity before firing. There were several agencies with law enforcement personnel on site that day, and they may have been trying to contact the different agencies to determine if they had someone manning that position. The snipers didn't want to kill a police officer.
 Meanwhile, some of the Secret Service detail closest to Trump acted heroically and shielded his body with their own while the area was being secured. But not all. In particular, three female Secret Service officers with Trump looked like the Keystone Cops.
 One cowered behind the podium for cover instead of putting her body in harm's way as required. One officer was so short that Trump towered over her, which means she offered no body protection at all. Donald Trump is 6'3"". Officers protecting him should be 6'4"" or taller.
 It's not rocket science. The woman protecting him appeared about 5'7"", was chubby and seemed out of shape. She could not holster her pistol and instead waved it around as Trump was being pushed into his car. The three female Secret Service officers ran in circles near Trump's car instead of forming a solid security perimeter. One appeared more concerned with getting her sunglasses on than protecting the former president.
 It was a clownish performance. Was this the result of DEI policies at the Secret Service implemented by Kimberly Cheatle, the new Secret Service head who publicly stated that DEI was one of her priorities?
 There will be congressional hearings on this topic beginning Monday. Hopefully, there will be some accountability before copycat assassination attempts begin. But people are rarely held accountable in Washington these days. Just look at the Afghanistan debacle.
 The impact of the attempted assassination on Trump will be straightforward. Not previously considered battlegrounds such as New Hampshire, Minnesota, Virginia and New Mexico are suddenly in play. Biden's leads in reliably Democrat states such as New York and New Jersey are now down to single digits and could fall lower.
 Another political plus for Trump is that the Democrats have had to cancel a despicable advertising campaign they had planned referring to Trump as a ""rapist,"" ""convicted felon"" and more. The budget for this ad campaign was $50 million and it was timed to run during the Republican convention this week. Those plans are on hold and may have to be scrapped completely as sympathy for Trump grows.
 Democrat politicians in down-ballot races for governor, senator and House member are in full panic mode. We could be looking at an Electoral College landslide for Trump of perhaps 340-195, which would be one of the largest Electoral College wins in US history.
 The Republicans could top that off by winning the Senate 55-45 or better and expanding their majority in the House to 230 Republicans-205 Democrats. Numerous governorships and state legislatures could fall the Republicans' way as well.
 This brings us to the most widely discussed political topic prior to the assassination attempt – Biden's collapse into senility, his physical infirmity, and the conflicting Democrat attempts to cover up the reality of Biden's health and to push him aside in favor of Kamala Harris.
 Let's be blunt about Biden's mental and physical health. Biden is in the late stages of cognitive decline. He refuses to take any cognitive tests (or, if he has, to release the results) and to receive a proper diagnosis.
 Biden's personal physician is an old crony who has been in on Biden family rackets, so he's hardly an objective source. Jill Biden is more of an acting president than a caring spouse and she's lousy at both jobs.
 A number of competent physicians have said that, in their view, Biden has advanced Parkinson's disease as evidenced by immobility in his right arm and shaking in his left hand in addition to the mental lapses.
 Biden's recent public appearances are either totally scripted right down to flash cards with reporters' names and prearranged questions and answers, read from a teleprompter, or prerecorded (and who knows how many flubs were left on the cutting-room floor?). It's all a facade.
 Historian Victor Davis Hanson has compared Biden's condition to the last days of Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet Communist leader who died in 1982. Long before Brezhnev died, he was physically and mentally disabled and propped up by continual lies and propaganda about how he was in good health and in command. That artifice and wall of lies are exactly what we are encountering in the case of Biden today.
 Late Sunday night, Biden gave an Oval Office speech in reaction to the Trump shooting and referred to the last president as ""former Trump"" and made repeated references to the ""battle box"" instead of the ballot box.
 Biden topped this off by almost saying, ""Make America Great Again,"" before catching himself in mid-sentence and pivoting away from the MAGA Republican mantra. It was a pathetic performance in tightly controlled circumstances.
 Biden is beyond functioning capably in the real world of politics, foreign crises and ongoing wars, let alone a political campaign.
 Who's really in charge at the White House? It depends on the issue. When it comes to high-level policy, it's the Obama team including holdovers like Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan and Obama flunkies on the sidelines like Susan Rice and Victoria Nuland. When it comes to technical matters that are part of the progressive agenda, the deep-state swamp creatures in the bureaucracy are in charge.
 But where the presidential campaign and Biden's determination to remain a candidate are concerned, power rests with a small cabal. The members of this inner circle are ""Taco"" Jill
 Biden, the convicted felon Hunter Biden, Joe's sister Valerie Biden Owens, and a few close aides including Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti, Bruce Reed, Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini.
 Donilon is the brother of Obama's national security adviser Tom Donilon. Bruce Reed is an old hand from the Clinton administration. Bernal and Tomasini are close aides to Jill Biden and are practically an extension of the Biden Crime Family. Ricchetti is a lawyer and one of Joe Biden's longest-serving aides.
 That Gang of Eight are the only people with regular access to Joe Biden. They are the ones insisting that he's staying in the race and issuing the propaganda that says everything is fine with Biden. Even regular White House staff such as Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, former Chief of Staff Ron Klain, adviser Anita Dunn, and Biden's lawyer Bob Bauer cannot get close to Biden anymore given the encasement established by the Gang of Eight.
 Their posture can well be likened to a coup d'etat in America. It's not violent, but it is real. The Gang of Eight are running the country. Biden is a zombie.
 At the same time, another gang of so-called Super Friends of Biden including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi are preparing to tell Biden he must withdraw from the presidential race for the good of the party and endorse Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential nomination.
 The shoot-out between the Gang of Eight and the Super Friends will happen by next weekend. You can think of it as the 1881 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral between the outlaw Clanton and McLaury brothers on one side and Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday on the other.
 The difference is that the O.K. Corral featured bad guys versus good guys whereas the battle between the Gang and the Super Friends has bad guys on both sides. They're all looking out for themselves.
 Nothing public on the Democratic side will happen this week because the news will be dominated by the Trump shooting and the Republican convention. By Friday, the knives will be out for Biden.
 The Democrats' plan is to nominate Biden and Harris in an all-virtual digital roll call vote in late July ahead of their scheduled Aug. 19 convention in Chicago. This means there will only be 10 days at most between the end of the Republican convention and the Democrats' virtual roll call. That's a short window for the Super Friends.
 Biden's Gang of Eight may have successfully run out the clock. We'll know more next week, but for now it appears the Dems may be going with the zombie candidate for better or worse.
 The Biden family may emerge the winner. The American people are most certainly the losers."
2024-07-13,"Title:Things Fall Apart. Big Things
Article:Geopolitical and financial risks are proliferating...

 The ERA of global integration and accord has ended and the era of global disintegration and discord is heating up, writes OfTwoMind's Charles Hugh Smith in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 In historian Peter Turchin's terminology, when everyone finds reasons to cooperate, the result is an era of accord; when everyone finds reasons not to cooperate, the result is an era of discord.
 Beneath the chaotic swirl of complex dynamics and risk, two core drivers emerge: De-globalization and de-financialization.
 The 30-year era of increasing globalization has reversed, reducing the influence of markets and increasing the influence of national security.
 Where the globalization era led to global trade agreements which served at least a few of every participants' core interests, the de-globalization era will be characterized by fragmentation and deals being cut between nations outside of traditional alliances and ideological camps.
 In the neoliberal worldview, markets are solutions to virtually every problem: Open up markets and let price discovery and innovations solve all problems.
 This construct is ideologically appealing, but in the real world, markets generated extremely risky supply-chain dependencies on unreliable offshore sources.
 Yes, these dependencies were efficient and profitable, but when things fall apart, they cause dominoes to fall far beyond what ""markets"" anticipated or could hedge.
 The 50-year era of increasing financialization has also reversed. In a nutshell, financialization optimized capital at the expense of labor/wage earners, and optimized speculation via the vast expansion of credit and leverage, enabling finance to commoditize virtually everything in the global economy – labor, capital, goods, services and yes, even risk.
 But commoditized risk that can be hedged only includes the risks that are visible and known. When extremes become more extreme, the potential for risk to escape the neatly fenced corral of hedged risk increases in ways that cannot be quantified and hedged.
 I tend to think many observers focus too narrowly on risks arising from financial crises, for example, a crisis in the multitrillion-Dollar shadowy derivatives market that could cascade as holders of derivative contracts with claims on underlying collateral (for example, the homes underlying mortgages in a mortgage-backed security) start seizing the collateralized assets embedded in the derivatives chain.
 The basic idea is well-established: derivatives (such as CLOs and CDOs as well as many even more exotic concoctions) can include claims on the underlying collateral of debt-based assets such as homes or vehicles.
 The public has tolerated a stinking mass of self-serving bailouts and insider dealings under the threat of ""If we don't do this, the entire system collapses in a heap"" for the past 15 years, but their patience with financier strip-mining may run out more quickly than the political elites imagine.
 History suggests that social revolutions often start spontaneously from an apparently trivial event: The deadwood of a corrupt system rigged to funnel asymmetric rewards to the few at the expense of the many finally catches fire, and quickly becomes a conflagration.
 US elites seem to have no recognition of that dynamic. And they wonder why Donald Trump is so popular with working-class Americans. Elites want to decry Trump's appeal to these ""deplorables"" without looking themselves in the mirror as to why Trump appeals to them.
 If the traditional party system worked so well for this large swath of Americans, Trump never would have gotten so far. He would have been laughed off the stage in the 2016 primaries, and never would have won the Republican nomination, let alone the general election.
 But Trump won the election. And elites have refused to recognize their failure that resulted in his election. But the story is bigger. Now let's consider the world – and the Dollar.
 Significant portions of the world are looking to ""de-Dollarize."" This trend has greatly increased since the US has sought to ""weaponize"" the Dollar to punish its geopolitical opponents.
 More specifically, I'd characterize this vast reshuffling of global capital flows as a direct consequence of two factors:

 The ascendance of national security over market incentives (i.e. profits, mercantilist exports, etc.)
 The fragmentation of broad trade agreements in favor of special deals with trading partners that include not just tariffs but access to strategically significant commodities and investment capital flows.

In other words, trade is no longer about opening new markets for mercantilist exports and parking surplus Dollars in Treasuries. It's about securing essential commodities and capital flows in exchange for access to supply chains and financial markets.
 The mercantilist era has ended. So-called free trade (there is no such thing) that created critical national security-related dependencies on frenemies is now something to avoid and reverse at all costs.
 Mercantilist nations that have depended on increasing exports as the source of their economic growth will find markets restricted as relocalization and glocalization become priorities. (This includes China, Germany, Japan and other export-dependent economies).
 We can foresee deals that include access to commodities, guarantees to buy sovereign bonds, opening previously closed sectors of mercantilist economies and access to direct investment, not just trade and tariffs.
 In other words, the fragmentation of global trade opens the door to deals brokered between individual nations, tailored to their own interests, that cover not just interests in trade per se but in securing commodities, essentials and capital flows.
 Globalization is not dead, but it is fading. ""Glocalization"" is becoming the new mantra.
 Risk also rises when established processes break down as multiple crises emerge and reinforce each other – what's known as polycrisis. When established mechanisms no longer resolve crises or conflicts, then leaders will naturally be tempted to try ever more extreme measures to regain control (or the illusion of control).
 Every leader is prone to miscalculation, but authoritarian regimes with highly concentrated nodes of decision-making are more prone to making catastrophically bad decisions because they've suppressed dissent and open debate as threats to the regime's political and narrative control.
 The global trend toward authoritarianism concentrates decision-making in the hands of the few, increasing the risks of fatal misjudgments or miscalculations.
 Amidst a disconcertingly expanding universe of risks, here are 10 of note (hat tip to Richard Bonugli for assistance).
 It can be understood as a risk matrix. (My own list of 10 risks would be different, of course, but this is a worthy place to start).
 The Top 10 Geopolitical/Financial Risks

 Financiers seizing collateral in a derivatives crisis, AKA ""The Great Taking""
 Cyberattacks
 Tariff wars
 Confiscation of other nations' financial assets
 Selling/boycott of US Treasuries
 Imposition of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
 Russia's ban of uranium exports to the West
 Restrictions on strategically significant commodities
 Private cryptocurrencies forcibly folded into CBDCs
 Escalation of the Ukraine war
 The Mercantilist Era Is Over

Where does our risk assessment take us? Perhaps the most apt metaphor to describe the decade ahead is that investors, consumers and taxpayers will all be rafting whitewater rapids with ever-briefer stretches of calm.
 So what do we do as individuals? De-risk our lives as much as possible and focus on increasing our problem-solving skills.
 This is my definition of self-reliance."
2024-07-11,"Title:Gold and Silver's High-Price Recession
Article:How can bullion prices be rising if no-one is buying...?


              
           


So CHINA didn't buy any gold for its central-bank reserves for the second month running in June, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Chinese consumers have meanwhile vanished from the country's jewellery stores, and Indian households have also quit buying.
           

              
           

             Silver-backed ETF investment funds have grown less than 5% in size from last month's 4-year low, while 
            gold ETFs ended June at their smallest mid-year size since 2019...
           

              
           

             ...and 
            after making out like bandits in 2021-22 retail gold investment dealers and mints are really struggling as high prices combine with high interest rates to crush Western demand for coins and small bars.
           

              
           

             Yet the price?
           

              
           




              
           

             The world's bullion markets this spring set 
            new all-time gold price highs day-after-day and came within 1 cent of $2450...
           

              
           

             ...while silver topped $32.50 for the first time since 2012, adding 
            almost 45% in US Dollar terms inside 11 weeks of silver trading.
           

              
           

             Yes, that surge has burnt itself out. But silver ended last week with its highest Friday finish in London since the 11-year high it set in late May, down only 2.2% from that Friday's weekend peak.
           

              
           

             Gold meanwhile recorded its 5th highest-ever Friday 3pm benchmark for US and Euro investors...
           

              
           

             ...and even the British Pound's clear relief at Labour winning a landslide UK election victory over the Conservatives still gave gold its 6th best weekend in history against Sterling.
           

              
           

             That's great for investors who bought before the 2024 price jump, nevermind before the 2023 or 2020 rise. But for precious metals mints and sales-teams, today's higher prices look, feel and smell like a bear market in terms of new business.
           

              
           

             Gold Eagle sales from the US Mint have dropped by 2/3rds year-to-date. Australia's Perth Mint is laying off staff (albeit fewer than 1/3rd so far of its net hiring in 2022-23). Retail outlets in former market darling Germany face a ""state of emergency"" as sell-backs keep swamping demand with secondhand coin, draining cash as the last decade's buyers take profit.
           

              
           

             BullionVault isn't immune, even though it sells no coins and enables private investors instead to buy and sell large-bar bullion from 1 gram at a time.
           

              
           

             Gold just saw its 4th calendar quarter in a row of net selling on BullionVault. While outflows by weight slowed by 2/3rds from Q1's record profit-taking in gold, total client holdings finished June at the lowest end-quarter weight since Q2 2020.
           

              
           

             Silver meantime saw its 6th calendar quarter of net selling in a row with record heavy profit-taking by weight. That took client holdings down to the lowest end-quarter level since Q4 2020.
           

              
           

             Yet the remaining silver 
            in BullionVault custody still ended Q2 2024 with a new quarter-end record by value at $1.1 billion...
           

              
           

             ...and client gold holdings finished June at a new quarter-end record value of $3.3bn.
           

              
           

             What's more, gold trading volumes on BullionVault across April-to-June rose 25% by weight from Q1, and at record prices remember, while silver trading jumped 57% with prices at 11- and 12-year highs. 
           

              
           

             Altogether, that has proved BullionVault's stable, long-term and profitable business model (yet again) while also showing that investors using vaulted bullion to spread their risk are rebalancing their portfolios in 2024. This is far from a rush for the vault door. Which makes a stark contrast with precious-metals businesses needing to sell new product.
           

              
           

             ""People have stopped buying,"" says one jewellery store owner in Bengaluru, India – the No.2 gold consumer nation – speaking to the 
            Financial Times and 
            blaming the 2024 price jump.
           

              
           

             ""A person who could afford to buy around 100 or 200 grammes has just shifted to like 50 to 60 grams.""
           

              
           

             Jewellery buyers have gone on strike in China too, with gold's No.1 consumer market seeing stores empty of shoppers, and for the same reason.
           

              
           

             ""Selling gold is really difficult now,"" says a sales assistant speaking to China Observer.
           

              
           

             ""In the first half of this year, the price of gold had been rising...""
           

              
           

             ...
            denting demand so badly amid China's wider economic slowdown and financial slump that even sudden and massive discounting by big retail names like Chow Tai Fook failed to boost sales during the May Day holidays.
           

              
           

             This plunge in China's jewellery demand is already rippling through the industry. ""I had always planned to retire in Chow Tai Fook, and 
            did not expect the factory to be gone suddenly,"" one worker at CTF's plant in Shenzhen told financial news-site Lanjinger in May after being laid off. 
           

              
           

             Australian giant the Perth Mint is also cutting jobs thanks to poor demand for gold coins worldwide. Management blame ""weakening market conditions"" with sales volumes at the lowest in 5 years. But the 50 redundancies offered so far are still less than half the new hires which Perth made 
            in the 12 months to last June.
           

              
           

             Shopping-mall and online coin dealers also came into this slump after enjoying bumper times, most especially in Europe. But the Covid and then inflationary crises of 2020-2022 have now been followed by a jump in bank interest rates for Western households...
           

              
           

             ...making cash a more attractive asset after years and years of below-inflation returns...
           

              
           

             ...and gold's record-high prices keep inviting last decade's buyers to take a profit while deterring fresh buyers.
           

              
           

             This 
            high-price recession in retail gold investing has now been wearing on for 18 months. Newer dealers in Germany, the 
            go-go buyer of coins and small bars when interest rates on Euro bank accounts went below zero even before inflation in 2014 to 2022, risk running out of cash to buy back the metal they sold to those once-eager buyers...
           

              
           

             ...flooding the industry with unwanted and now secondhand coins, thereby hurting sales of newly minted products still further.
           

              
           

Gold-backed ETFs also shrank yet again in Q2 this year, with growth in Asian-listed products more than offset by heavy selling of European funds.
           

              
           




              
           

             The giant GLD gold ETF has seen a little inflow so far this month, but only after holding unchanged across Q2. The second-largest such product, the iShares GLD trust fund, has meanwhile shrunk to pre-Covid size.
           

              
           

             Add it together, and households in China and India – gold's 2 largest consumer markets – are shunning jewellery...
           

              
           

             ...gold and silver are meeting

             ...and now even the People's Bank of China has paused if not stopped adding to its gold reserves.
           

              
           

             So how come gold has held onto the gains it made last year and also the jump it made this spring on top?
           

              
           

Central banks as a group continue to build their reported holdings month after month, 
            led in June by India, Poland and Czech Republic. As a group, and 
            according to a survey published by the mining industry's World Gold Council, more than 2/3rds of central bankers say that allocations worldwide will rise across the next 12 months. Official data back that up, with 1-in-3 
            central banks adding gold across the past decade, swallowing well over 1 year's new mine supply. That doesn't account for unreported demand; analysts Metals Focus reckon it's added 50% as much on top.
           

              
           

The hot money remains hot but not scalding. Speculators in Comex futures and options ended June with the same bullish position on gold as they started last month, net of their bearish bets, close to its largest size since spring 2020's Covid catastrophe. That group's bullish betting in silver derivatives has eased back, but it remains almost 50% larger than its long-term average.
           

              
           

Thailand and Vietnam are 
            apparently seeing a real gold rush, with savers and investors emptying dealers' shelves amid fears of economic slump. Word is that 
            family offices and other wealthy investors in the USA are also raising their allocations ahead of November's White House election, slowly and quietly and certainly without any notable upturn in new US users here at BullionVault to date. Either way, we have seen 
            a surge of new users living in France, outstripping any other change across Western Europe in the run-up to and aftermath of Macron's snap (and stupid) election.
           

              
           

             Besides BullionVault client holdings, 
            total holdings of gold and silver in London vaults – 
            heart of precious metals global trading and storage  – actually rose again in June, ending the first half of 2024 at the highest since January, albeit a little lower from this time last year. That growth came in private-sector holdings, with central-bank gold 
            custodied at the Bank of England slipping a little from May's 4-month high.
           

              
           

             Finally, 
            it's now summer north of the Equator. So 
            a dip in gold prices is hardly news.
           

              
           

             India always goes quiet this time of year (after next week there aren't any auspicious days for Hindu weddings until October this year). So does China (its peak jewellery demand comes at Lunar New Year in January or February). There's also a lull, typically, in financial trading too (the old chestnut tells stock-market investors to 
            ""Sell in May..."").
           

              
           

             All told, this often sees the price of gold and silver soften or slip in June or July. And for summer 2024...
           

              
           

 The profit-taking among Western investors is not new. While it's now causing job losses in the precious metals industry, it's failed to derail silver and gold's steep rise in 2023 and 2024 to date;
 The pause in China's central-bank buying contrasts with continued reserves growth more widely;
 The slowdown in Chinese and Indian jewellery demand matches the seasonal pattern, and it contrasts with other Asian markets;
 Political risk, and most especially geopolitical shocks, look likely to support prices by encouraging investment demand as the back-half of 2024 unfolds;
 https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/opinion-analysis/gold-2500-2025-f...
 The US Fed, having delayed and delayed, looks set to give speculative traders the boost they've been betting on since Christmas last year, with its first cut to Dollar interest rates nailed on for September according to market forecasts and betting.


             Before then, gold and silver might have to get through the summer doldrums of low investment, empty jewellery shops, and beached traders.

2024-07-10,"Title:You, Investing vs. the Institutions
Article:From 9/11 to 20-second stock holding...

 On 10 JULY 2001 an Arizona-based FBI field agent called Ken Williams filed a warning with his bosses in Washington and New York, writes Tim Price at Price Value Partner.
 It was a six-page document that began as follows:
 ""The purpose of this communication is to advise the Bureau and New York of the possibility of a coordinated effort by USAMA BIN LADEN (UBL) to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.""
 As Steven Johnson, author of 'Where Good Ideas Come From' points out, this was the infamous ""Phoenix memo"", in which Williams had been compelled to draft his warning after detecting an unusually high number of people of ""investigative interest"" who had signed up at various flight schools in Arizona.
 Among the people Williams had interviewed was Zakaria Mustapha Soubra, an aeronautical engineering student on an F-1 visa from the UK. Soubra had pictures of bin Laden at his home. But after sitting on Williams' memo for three weeks, the agency assigned it to an analyst, who labelled it ""routine"".
 One month after Ken Williams filed his memo, Zacarias Moussaoui enrolled at Pan Am International Flight Academy at St Paul, Minnesota, where he started training to fly a Boeing 747-400 on a simulator. Onlookers grew suspicious after Moussaoui paid his entire $8,300 fee in cash, and claimed to have no interest in ever flying a real plane. Pan Am contacted the FBI. The FBI in Minnesota then tried frantically to obtain a search warrant to examine files on Moussaoui's laptop. That search warrant would not be granted until the afternoon of September 11, 2001.
 Our point is not to criticise the FBI or its role in US homeland security – they're tasked with a huge, difficult and complex job. But it is to highlight that in large organisations, things get missed. It wasn't that the FBI was unaware of a possible plot involving foreign students and aircraft – to their very great credit, an agency staffer reported his concerns. But the agency was too big, or too bureaucratic, to act sufficiently quickly on that information.
 The history of the financial crisis that erupted in 2007/8 and which continues to cast a long shadow over global monetary policy, fiscal policy, interest rates and stimulus-out-of-desperation, is a history of failing institutions. Central banks and government regulatory agencies conspicuously failed to understand, oversee or control commercial and investment banks during a historic property and credit bubble. And banking institutions, as we know only too well, by and large completely failed to manage their own balance sheets and risk exposures. Worse still, the markets have become hijacked by institutional entities with little or no interest in investing for the longer term.
 Happily, that could create some great investment opportunities for us in the years ahead.
 Consider the following astonishing statistic. Michael Hudson, a professor at the University of Missouri, has suggested that the average holding period for a US stock is 22 seconds. The average foreign currency investment lasts for 30 seconds. The markets have become playgrounds for what are called High Frequency Traders, in most cases computer-driven algorithmic models.
 The average holding of period for US stocks has collapsed. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the average holding period of US stocks – in months – was between 60 and 100. Within the space of a few decades that average holding period has gone from many months to just a few seconds.
 By the same token, Dollar trading volumes vs GDP have exploded. The 1929 US stock market peak coincided with a peak in this ratio: of over 100%. But having been well below that level for the rest of the last century, Dollar trading volumes relative to GDP in the US ballooned higher in the 1990s, and from 1999 vaulted over that 1929 level to over 400% in recent years.
 We're no Keynesians, but we will grant that the old economist had something to say on the subject of speculation:
 ""Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.""
 Here's the good news
 We happen to think there's something positive in these otherwise malign trends. We're not traders either, and we have no interest in the minute-to-minute (and now second-to-second) gyrations of the market. Trading is best left to the alleged professionals. But it may well be that with all these computers and algorithms trading against each other solely with a view to getting an edge over a time period that might only be a few seconds long, they give rise to occasional opportunities for genuine value investors to prosper, particularly when favoured stocks get driven down to unusual levels. These systems are not interested whatever in longer term value, but only in short-term speculation and accumulating multiple numbers of relatively tiny trading profits. They have reduced the market, in their terms, to a casino in all but name. Rather than be buffeted about by the 'noise' players in the high frequency trading arena, we'd rather stay out of the way and bide our time.
 Jesse Livermore was a famous stock trader during the early 20th Century, who made and lost several fortunes during a turbulent career. But he had a rare insight into the psychology of successful investing:
 ""The big money is made by the sittin' and the waitin', not the thinking. After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of Dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.""
 As a private investor you have one enormous advantage over the professional trader. You can invest when you like – and you can sit on your hands for as long as you like. The professional trader, especially if employed by an investment bank or hedge fund, is more or less compelled to trade. We alluded to this disparity in our recent commentary 'The smartest guys in the room'. As the US author and asset manager Jim O'Shaughnessy puts it,
 ""Markets change minute by minute. Human nature barely changes millennium by millennium. There's your edge.""
 Or as the popular Liverpool beat music combo 'Frankie' once advised: Relax.
 In 1972, the great 'value' investor and our preferred investment guru, Benjamin Graham, wrote:
 ""The speculative public is incorrigible. In financial terms it cannot count beyond three. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some 'action' in progress.""
 Be careful what you wish for. The 1990s' wave of disintermediation of bankers and full-service brokers brought with it stock trading in real time. Gone were the days when you could only access stock prices by telephoning your broker or waiting to read the market reports in the next day's Financial Times. Thanks to firms like Charles Schwab, the stock market could now be played like a computer game. Stock prices became animated, visual and constantly changing: green for up, red for down.
 We're not Luddites, and we happily concede that there can be no uninventing the web. The point is that the immediate gratification of online share dealing is not an unalloyed boon to investors. It comes at a price – the price being the fact that our brains are insufficiently evolved to deal dispassionately with losses visible in real time. Our brains are also hard-wired to practise pattern recognition and prediction. This served our ancestors well when we roamed the savannah searching for food and learning to avoid predators. It serves us as investors less well when we 'see' patterns in stock prices that aren't really there, or when the amygdala in our brain, the seat of our 'fight or flight' response, is stimulated almost beyond endurance by a loss-making online transaction.
 Using MRI scans, leading brain researchers including Jordan Grafman at the National Institutes of Health and Hans Breiter of Harvard Medical School have demonstrated that the more frequently people are told that they are losing money, the more active their amygdala becomes. Jason Zweig, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, observes:
 ""There can be no doubt that online trading, by displaying stock prices in a dynamic visual format that can directly activate the fear centre of the brain, made losing money more viscerally painful than it had ever been before. Once the arrows (denoting stock prices) turned red, investors could not help but panic. And the red arrows were everywhere: on their computer screens and financial television programmes in pubs and restaurants, bars and barbershops, brokerage offices and taxicabs. Investors no longer had the option of simply not opening the newspaper. Technology had turned financial losses into an inescapable, ambient presence.""So what's the solution?
 The business of investing is not meant to be exciting. Rather than falling prey to sensation-seeking behaviour, the practical response to the temptations of the digital age is almost comically simple. Just turn the computer off.
 To some, depriving oneself of trading info will be unthinkable. But consider Nassim Taleb's retired dentist. Showcased in Taleb's excellent book, 'Fooled by Randomness', our hypothetical friend is destined to earn, on average, 15% per annum from his portfolio, with an associated volatility (annualised standard deviation of return) of 10%.
 If our retired friend monitors his portfolio in real time, however, the (entirely random) short-term oscillations of the market, and therefore of his portfolio, are bound to trigger extreme anxiety. Depending on the frequency with which he observes his portfolio, our friend can precisely control the extent of heartache and distress to which he will expose himself. The following table makes the risk/reward outlook quite clear.
 Frequency of monitoring the portfolio Probability of pleasurable outcome
 1 second 50.02% 1 minute 50.17% 1 hour 51.30% 1 day 54% 1 month 67% 1 quarter 77% 1 year 93% Source: 'Fooled by Randomness' by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
 The lesson is clear. Too much portfolio monitoring can be injurious to your health. If Taleb's dentist simply moderates the frequency with which he checks his portfolio, he will boost his chances of incurring a positive emotional outcome from that monitoring. And note that nothing changes about the composition of his portfolio – only the frequency with which he checks it.
 The same holds when it comes to consuming financial news. The continuing enhancement of digital communication technologies is a double-edged sword. It means that absorbing financial and investment information from the web, or from the world's various news media or cable channels, is like drinking from a fire hose. Here is one of the funniest things ever said by an asset manager:
 ""Whenever I go into a brokerage office and see that the brokers are all watching CNBC, it feels like walking into the Mayo Clinic, and finding that all the doctors are watching 'General Hospital'.""
 Again, the solution is plain. Whether it's a TV screen or a computer screen, just turn it off."
2024-07-08,"Title:ChatGPT Makes Copper the New Oil
Article:10x the electricity use of a Google search...

 DID you know that every time you type a query into ChatGPT, it requires about 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search? asks Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 That's according to Goldman Sachs, which writes in a new report that electricity consumption in the US is poised for a major surge for the first time in years, due in large part to the rapid buildout of data centers that power AI platforms such as ChatGPT.
 Goldman says it's projecting electricity demand to rise approximately 2.4% from 2022 to 2030, with data centers representing the largest growth segment at 0.9 percentage points – nearly a third of total new demand.
 
 Goldman isn't the only firm that's forecasting huge changes to the US energy grid.
 The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit, estimates that data centers could consume up to 9% of US electricity generation by 2030, more than double their current consumption.
 To help put things in perspective, ChatGPT currently has over 180 million users, but there are around 5.3 billion internet users around the world. Imagine if each of them became a regular user of energy-intensive ChatGPT, whose servers are located in the US, according to owner OpenAI.
 The US is currently home to nearly 5,400 data centers, the most of any other nation by far. Even so, additional capacity will need to come online to meet runaway demand, and giant tech companies – from OpenAI and Microsoft to Google, Meta, Amazon and more – are spending billions to position themselves as leaders in the nascent industry.
 
 So how will this biblical amount of electricity be generated? According to a separate Goldman report, natural gas is expected to supply 60% of the growth from AI and data centers, with renewables providing the remaining 40%.
 The resurgence in natural gas demand is already being felt, with analysts at Wood Mackenzie now expecting total US gas demand to increase by 30 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) by the early 2040s, a substantial increase from previous estimates. This spike is due to the AI boom and the corresponding rise in data center activity.
 For investors, this presents a unique opportunity. Natural gas prices, which are down more than 32% so far this year due to strong production and lower demand, are expected to rebound. Wells Fargo projects that prices could average $3.50 per thousand cubic feet by 2030, a 46% increase over the 2024 average price of $2.39. This potential for price appreciation, I believe, makes natural gas an attractive investment.
 While natural gas will be a key player in meeting future power needs, copper is equally essential, particularly for its role in the energy transition. Copper is the only critical mineral present in AI as well as all of the most important clean energy technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power. Its combination of conductivity, longevity, ductility and corrosion resistance makes it an indispensable mineral.
 However, the supply side of the copper market is fraught with challenges. To meet current trends, an astounding 115% more copper must be mined in the next 30 years than has been mined in human history. The International Energy Forum (IEF) warns that under current policy settings, it's unlikely there will be sufficient new mines to achieve 100% EV adoption by 2035. This is compounded by declining ore quality, which leads to increasing capital and operating costs.
 Ready or not, demand for the red metal continues to soar. Year-to-date, copper prices are up nearly 25% and recently hit an all-time high of over $11,000 per ton. This price surge is driven by long-term demand forecasts and supply constraints, making copper a highly attractive commodity.
 The anticipated rise in US power demand, driven by AI, EVs and the energy transition, will undoubtedly impact the markets. As I see it, natural gas and copper stand out as assets I might want to have exposure to going forward.
 Natural gas offers a stable and growing demand outlook, with prices poised to recover from recent lows. Investing in natural gas companies or ETFs that focus on this sector could provide significant returns as the demand for power grows.
 Similarly, copper's essential role in the energy transition makes it a critical investment. I don't believe anyone can deny its long-term demand viability. Investors should consider exposure to copper through mining companies, ETFs or even futures contracts to capitalize on this trend."
2024-07-05,"Title:Bidenomics, Bidenflation
Article:Stop complaining and just vote for the old man...

 NO, Joke Biden didn't invent inflation, writes Sean Ring in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 But he inadvertently attached his name to it, much like Jimmy Carter did in the 1970s.
 A few months ago, Greg Ip wrote the most condescendingly asinine article The Wall Street Journal ever had the misfortune to publish.
 In ""What's Wrong With the Economy? It's You, Not the Data,"" Ip alleged The Great Unwashed™ were too stupid to realize how good everything was under Dear Leader Potatohead Biden.
 Ip wrote:
 ""Yes, some individuals faced higher inflation (someone who bought a house, for instance) but, for the average person, inflation went down.
 ""When it comes to the economy, the vibes are at war with the facts, and the vibes are winning. This is obviously bad news for President Biden's re-election hopes. He can't exactly tell voters that they are wrong; he would be called out of touch. And it probably wouldn't change anything. The vibes seem symptomatic of a broader pessimism disconnected from the data.""
 It's tempting to chalk this up to a misunderstanding. Lower inflation means the level of prices is still rising, just more slowly than before. People sometimes conflate inflation with the level of prices and believe inflation is getting worse because the price level keeps going up (it rarely goes down).
 The thing is, Ippie thinks you should care more about the math than your wallet. Sure, inflation can fall (disinflation) while prices keep rising, and deflation (falling prices) only happens in industries where the government can't get its paw in the jar. But the government policy counts, not the fact you can't buy steak next month, according to Ip.
 Idiotic.
 If a product cost $1 two years ago, and last year's inflation was 10%, and this year's is 5% (year-on-year): yes, inflation fell 50%. But it also means that the product cost $1.10 last year and $1.16 today.
 That's much more expensive (16%) for the lower and middle classes, as food, shelter, and energy costs eat up a lot more of their wallets than those of rich folk.
 So, of course, they – the hoi polloi – are upset at Biden. But more compelling evidence has come out lately.
 Here's a pro tip from Seanie: never attach your name to something when you believe in nothing.
 Joke Biden has never had a coherent economic strategy. His only economic method is to rely on his Congress to spend as much as they can without outright destroying the Dollar. Bidenomics shows you everything wrong with the Beltway's Madison Avenue obsession.
 But it's worked so far, depending on how you view things.
 If you're in the crowd that gets the goodies, you must be pleased as punch. But I suspect you're not, which is why you'll hold your nose and pull the lever for The Donald this autumn.
 But this chart has been making the rounds on social media, with good reason. Courtesy of The Wall Street Journal:
 
 Things make a lot more sense now.
 Biden claims household wealth has gone up nearly 20% under him, roughly the same as Trump's through three years of their presidency.
 But there's one huge difference: Biden's growth is a mere 0.7% once you adjust for inflation. Trump's was 16.0%.
 Old joke:
 Why did God create economists?
 To make weathermen look good.
 The Nobel Prize in Economics is fake, in case you didn't know it. The Swedish Central Bank awards it, not the Nobel Committee, which is why it's called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. So foul is the odor that emanates from this prize, that four of Nobel's relatives have formally distanced themselves from it.
 And yet, we accord the people who win this gong a level of respect they simply did not, can not, and will not earn. Ever. They aren't the coming of Hari Seldon, of Foundation fame, much to Paul Krugman's chagrin. They can't predict the future. Heck, they're so awful at calling the shots, you may as well flip a coin and listen to them.
 And yet they keep committing their signatures to nonsense papers because they think no one's keeping track of their awful track records.
 For instance, my friend and colleague Alan Knuckman brought up in our editorial meeting yesterday that sixteen – count 'em! – sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists wrote an open letter warning that if Donald Trump won a second term, his economic agenda would be ""vastly"" inferior to that of President Joe Biden's and that Trump would also ""reignite"" the inflation ""which has come down remarkably fast.""
 As the British would say, ""The bloody cheek!""
 Thanks to Tiana Lowe Doescher of The Washington Examiner, we know 14 of the 16 who penned this letter also wrote a letter in 2021 supporting Build Back Better.
 Doescher writes:
 ""You see, 14 of the 16 economists from the 2024 letter wrote another letter in September 2021 cheering on Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda, which would later become the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law [BIL].
 ""Spearheaded by Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia, George Akerlof of Georgetown, Sir Angus Deaton of Princeton, Sir Oliver Hart of Harvard, Eric Maskin of Harvard, Daniel McFadden of Berkley, Paul Milgrom of Stanford, Roger Myerson of the University of Chicago, Edmund Phelps of Columbia, Paul Romer of NYU, William Sharpe of Stanford, Robert Shiller of Yale, Christopher Sims of Princeton, and Robert Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claimed that the BIL, which infused about half a trillion Dollars of new spending into the economy, would 'ease longer-term inflationary pressures' despite inflation already running at 5%.""
 Again, this September 2021 letter would be less embarrassing if Stiglitz hadn't already endorsed the preliminary portion of the BBB agenda, the American Rescue Plan.
 Rewind back to February 2021, when inflation was just 1.7%, Stiglitz called a refusal to pass the ""urgently needed"" $1.9 trillion ARP ""irresponsible and reckless"".
 In short, these guys don't have any better idea of the outcome of policies than you do. Trust your wallet. Don't ever trust these charlatans, one of whom (Akerloff) is married to the most incompetent Treasury Secretary in US history.
 The reason why you don't feel any wealthier than when Trump was in is because you aren't materially wealthier than then.
 If you were worth $100,000 (for math's sake) on Day 1 of Biden's term, you are now worth, on average, $100,700. You've increased your wealth by $700 over three years, or $233.33. Thanks to Joke Biden, you can go to one more baseball game than before.
 Of course, if you're lucky enough to be in the arms business, I congratulate you."

             Indeed, on the biggest historical sweep which BullionVault research can provide, gold hasn't been this valuable in terms of the Pound since the 
            political mayhem and murder of the War of the Roses. Which is really something.
           

              
           

             But if today's record price of gold reflects record mistrust in politics, then the UK electorate only has itself to blame. Because modern history says that, when viewed through the prism of gold prices, voters keep choosing the most awful frauds to run the country.
           

              
           




              
           

             Over the past 6 decades, and noting that Harold Wilson got the keys to Number 10 twice, only 1 out of 12 prime ministers presided over a drop in the price of gold in Pound Sterling terms (column F).
           

              
           

             Even more remarkably, that person was Liz Truss! Which is really something given her 
            disastrous 7-week tenure plus the fact that 
            even Tory historians think she was the worst PM in modern history.
           

              
           

             But that data only looks at the nominal price of gold. And inflation matters.
           

              
           

             So when we adjust the price of gold by the cost of living (column G) – and if we put the 49 Days' Queen in the bin – then you have to go back to John Major in the 1990s to find a Prime Minister who didn't see the real value of gold rise during their time in Number 10 Downing Street.
           

              
           

             Might today's Labour landslide (as predicted by everyone) snap this pattern of worsening trust, rising gold?
           

              
           

             Perhaps.
           




              
           

             Tracking back to Harold Wilson's victory in the General Election of October 1964, gold has way outperformed cash in the bank, house prices and even the UK stock market, dividends included.
           

              
           

             The table above adjusts those asset classes by RPI inflation for UK investors and savers. And as you can see, gold rose sharply during the inflation crisis of the 1970s, and again during New Labour's house-price bubble and banking bust of the early 2000s.
           

              
           

             Across the past 14 years of Conservative rule, gold has underperformed the total return from UK shares, but its 28% gain over and above inflation contrasts with house prices flattening as the value of cash savings sank by more than one-third.
           

              
           

             Moreover, the 4.5 years since Boris Johnson vowed to 'Get Brexit done' and won a landslide victory over Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party – just in time to be confronted by the Covid pandemic – have seen the real value of gold rise more than 21%...
           

              
           

             ...while investing in the stock market has lost almost 3% after inflation...
           

              
           

             ...real house prices have dropped over 7%...
           

              
           

             ...and cash in the bank has lost nearly 18% of its purchasing power.
           

              
           

             To be clear, I'm not blaming the Tories for all that. Global forces and 
            geopolitics keep trumping democracy in how the 2020s are playing out.
           

              
           

             Further back, when the Conservatives were in office if not in power from 1970 to 1974 under Ted Heath, inflation exploded and the stock market sank amid the first global Oil Crisis. And it's hard to imagine Labour Party government under Harold Wilson handling that disaster any better.
           

              
           

             More recently, it's hard to believe that the banking crisis starting in 2007 would have been any less catastrophic under a Conservative government than under New Labour, not least because the Tories would have done nothing to curb or tame the preceding bubble.
           

              
           

             But the fact is, gold has repeatedly acted as investment insurance for UK residents wanting to spread their risk and defend their savings, whether against geopolitical curve-balls or against the slings and arrows of the buffoons we seem to keep electing to power.
           

              
           

             Maybe you know the famous line from Victorian socialist Bernard Shaw:
           

              
           

             ""[When] you have to choose between trusting to the natural stability of gold and the natural stability of the honesty and intelligence of the members of the government...[then] I advise you...to vote for gold.""
           

              
           

             Shaw 
            wrote that in 1928 as Britain (briefly) put itself back on a Gold Standard after the catastrophe of the First World War. But over the past 6 decades, it's worked pretty well as financial advice too."

FORGET democracy, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Geopolitics will drive the gold price to new record highs by 2025.
           

              
           

             Says who?
           

              
           

             Says the hundreds of BullionVault users responding to our mid-year survey in late June.
           

              
           

             Finding 9-in-10 of our global client base in Western Europe and North America, we have been asking BullionVault users for their motives, concerns and price outlook every six months since December 2014, starting with readers of our 
            Weekly Update research emails.
           

              
           

             That makes our survey by far the largest, longest and most consistent of Western private investors who hold precious metals in their portfolio.
           

              
           

             This summer's poll, asking about the second-half 2024 outlook, ran from 12th to 25th June. It received 1,665 full responses from across BullionVault's global client base, including from 776 UK users.
           

              
           

             And on average, our respondents forecast that gold bullion prices, after setting a run of new all-time highs already in 2024, will rise a further 11.2% by year-end...
           

              
           

             ...topping $2500 per Troy ounce for the first time ever as the bells chime in 2025.
           

              
           

             Gold $2583 to be precise. Which looks a worthwhile prediction, given our users' 
            success in calling gold's 2023 price outcome and their early success in calling 2024's full-year gains, albeit six months ahead of schedule.
           

              
           




              
           

             So what about the politics?
           

              
           

             This year brings a packed calendar of democratic elections. From India to Uruguay, Iran to the USA, over 2 billion in 2024 get to put their X next to the leader of their choice...
           

              
           

             ...using the signature of illiterates, the sick and the majestic 
            throughout history.
           

              
           

             Many of this year's votes have already sent things sideways, if not upside down.
           

              
           

             Narendra Modi 
            lost his majority in India. Mexico elected its 
            first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Emmanuel 
            Macron lost so badly in June's European elections, he called a snap election for the French parliament to try embarrassing his 'far right' opponents...
           

              
           

             ...only to suffer 
            another wipe-out on record turnout so far instead.
           

              
           

             But while financial markets have wibbled and wobbled in response, India's Sensex has already recovered its 
            Modi election-news plunge and set fresh all-time highs (just like 
            the godsend himself 
            predicted). Mexico's steep currency and stock-market drops extend 
            what the wider region is suffering (the BMV IPC hit new record highs earlier in 2024 under 
            Sheinbaum's equally left-wing and more populist predecessor AMLO). France's borrowing costs have also eased from the 8-month high hit after Le Pen's National Rally won last weekend's first-round vote, while 
            the CAC40 index has rallied together with bond prices.
           

              
           

             So while much of the media appears surprised by the direction of democratic politics, the fact is that financial markets – and most notably safe-haven gold – have been little moved by the 'shock' events above...
           

              
           

             ...just like bullion prices didn't move on Donald Trump's clear win over Joe Biden in last week's US presidential debate.
           

              
           

             All this contrasts with the UK's 2016 Brexit referendum result, when 
            gold leapt 22% in British Pound terms inside 6 hours and the MSCI World Index of major-economy stock markets sank 4.9% against the Dollar. It also marks a clear break from the news of Trump's first White House victory that November, when gold spiked by 6% against the Dollar only to fall hard by the time he took office the following January as the S&P500 rose by more than 6%, on its way to 
            rising in all but one of the 12 months in 2017, something never achieved before or since (so far).
           

              
           

             The difference? Shock, in a word.
           

              
           

             Brexit and Trump 1 weren't the consensus forecasts in 2016. (Hell, they 
            weren't even consensus among the UK or 
            US electorates either.) Whereas in 2024, National Rally has been 
            growing its share of French votes for well over a decade, and 
            Melania Trump has no doubt kept the measurements for 
            new carpets and drapes from her first stint as First Lady.
           

              
           

             What's more, the odds of a political 'shock' today are vanishingly small, thanks to 
            the genuine and relentless geopolitical shocks which the 2020s keep delivering.
           

              
           

             From Covid lockdowns to near double-digit inflation, and from Russia invading Ukraine to Hamas pouring across Israel's border (and Israel flattening Gaza in response) things that voters and the financial markets never saw coming just keep coming.
           

              
           

             Really, what does a turn to the 'far right' matter among French voters after that? Or the 'shock' of a convicted felon winning the White House? 
           

              
           

             But politics do still matter for gold, according to our latest survey. Just not democracy.
           

              
           

             Over half of UK investors (52.6%) believe that Thursday's General Election won't impact the price of gold. Nor will the US election in November have any sway over the gold price according to 2-in-5 investors worldwide (40.7%).
           

              
           

             Instead – and in contrast to those domestic democratic ballots – it's the politics between different countries, regions and alliances that count for the direction of gold prices in the second-half of 2024. Or so the world's largest single pool of private citizens investing in precious metals say, polled by the world-leading marketplace which they use.
           

              
           




              
           

             Geopolitics is seen as the No.1 driver of precious metals prices between now and New Year.
           

              
           

             Landing 29.7% of all responses this summer, it topped BullionVault's twice-yearly survey for the first time since the start of 2020.
           

              
           

             Behind Geopolitics, one-in-five investors (20.0%) say that Demand for gold will have the largest impact on its price between now and New Year.
           

              
           

             That's the strongest-ever showing for market fundamentals – marked as Supply/Demand in our graph above – in 10 years of BullionVault surveys. It comes as a jump in Chinese households buying gold has adding to the relentless purchases being made by emerging-market central banks.
           

              
           

             That pushes Monetary Policy – named as the No.1 driver 13 times across 20 surveys to date – into third place (17.1%), its weakest position since New Year 2019.
           

              
           

             Bottom line?
           

              
           

             This year's global election events might shake up the political landscape for half the world's population. But for safe-haven gold, those elections in themselves won't move the needle.
           

              
           

             Moreover, the independent central banks running monetary policy across those democracies (and chosen by their elected leaders, remember) are having less impact on the price of gold and other precious metals than any time in 5 years, too.
           

              
           

             Of course, because gold tends to do well when other assets do badly, investing in bullion is often associated with dark times. The ongoing war in Ukraine, the slaughter in Gaza (and the slaughter which spurred it), rising tensions between China and the US over Taiwan, plus rising tensions between China and pretty much everyone else bordering the East or South China Seas, all means that geopolitics is firmly at the forefront of investors' minds...
           

              
           

             ...and there's little darker than democracy's impact on the world being crowded out by geopolitics as investors trading gold target a record price for the eve of 2025 above $2500 per ounce.
           

              
           

Note: None of this means investors won't respond to domestic politics by buying bullion. More residents of France, for instance, began investing in gold and other precious metals this spring than during any calendar quarter since the start of 2021. Amid the 'shock' of Le Pen's National Rally heading for a parliamentary majority, those 
            first-time French users of BullionVault also just topped the number in Germany – formerly gold's biggest Western investment market – for the first time in over a decade as well."
2024-07-03,"Title:Monster Bad Breadth Hits Stocks
Article:But so what...?

 A SUBSCRIBER sent me analysis calling for a 'Monster [bullish] reversion trade for the ages' writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 It's based on the extreme under-performance of the Equal Weight SPX (RSP) to the Headline SPX. The writer's conclusion is that after such an extreme divergence the spring back in RSP vs. SPY/SPX is strong and the broader market is the place to be for out-performance.
 Can't argue with that.
 Here is the daily chart of Equal Weight/Headline comparison we often review along with its bearish implications (divergence) prior to the last two bear cycles.
 
 I have added the nominal view of RSP for context. True enough, after the market corrections Equal Weight sprang back to out-performance mode.
 The lesson is, you want to buy the broader market after a previous cycle has thinned out to the headliners and then finally the whole mess tanked.
 But the key here is 'after' market corrections. The analyst projects 'monster' gains for the broader market because the ratio at top has tanked to the degree of previous extremes that preceded 'monster reversion trades'.
 I have a distaste for terms like 'monster', 'rocket', 'a train leaving the station', or the media's 'investors cheered' [insert here whatever eyeball harvesting news of the day triggers the cheer]; not to mention others like the 'got gold?' jingle and the commodity 'super cycle' that has been coming any day now for the last 16 years, the 'Great Rotation', the BRICS ""de-dollarization' pitch...
 ...and a whole host of other nicknames, jingles and promos that instigate greed and emotion in investors.
 So let's throw away the word 'monster' and simply review the situation.
 The analyst is correct, bottoms in the ratio have indeed preceded periods of broader market out-performance as the market seeks equilibrium AFTER a negative divergence like today's has already tanked the markets, broad and equal weight alike. So it would appear that an important qualifier was omitted. Indeed, the article's view is that it can keep going.
 Here's the bottom line: The stock market rally can keep going. Better yet, all stocks should begin to participate in the coming months...and years.
 Market breadth readings indicate an undeniable truth: most stocks in the S&P 500 are vastly underperforming a handful of mega-cap behemoths.
 Since 2007, this trend has rarely lasted long. More importantly, the setup is incredibly bullish for the under-loved stocks in the market.
 If history is a guide, we will be looking at a monster reversion trade where the equal weighted S&P will play catch up to the market bellwethers.
 Well of course, it ""can"" keep going. This market with its crossed signals and failed (or at least delayed historical quants) has been a challenge. Like riding a bucking bronco or worse, a nasty and pissed off bull. But the fact is that when coloring the above analysis with actual historical facts, the RSP/SPY ratio negatively diverged during phases where the nominal SPY, and RSP for that matter, were rising. Just like today.
 The big bullish ""monster"" trade [even there, I see no monster, just healthy broad breadth leadership] did not materialize until after widespread price damage was done to most markets.
 The writer uses 2007 as the historical 'look back' period, so lets widen our view. Never in the history of this view has the ""monster"" bullish signal come about while the nominal stock market was still rising, let alone making new highs. That seems to me to be an important qualifier. The big reversion trade in 2009 came after a pervasive market crash. The big reversion trade in 2020 also came after a market crash, of sorts.
 
 Now, let's take it a step further.
 You may recall that the fact that RSP/SPY was rising during the supposed bear market of 2022 aided our view that it was not a real bear market but rather, an extended correction. RSP/SPY was a positive breadth underpinning.
 So for the sake of integrity, you need to know that I will call what I see, not what my dogma sees. And what I saw in 2022 was positive beneath the surface. What I see now is an as yet unrealized negative divergence to the stock market as a whole.
 The implication, based on history, based on quant, is that sure the broad market may well play catch up to and out-perform the sexy headline stuff (cough cough Nvidia, cough cough Microsoft...).
 But it will do so AFTER the current divergence and thinned out market resolves into a bear market, including the broader stuff as represented by RSP. So yes, I think that's an important qualifier, don't you?"
2024-07-02,"Title:Gold Profit-Taking Slows Near Zero at New Record Prices
Article:Demand in France beats Germany 6th month running amid snap election...


              
           


FRESH record-high gold prices failed to spur fresh dis-investing among Western investors in June, with users of BullionVault slowing their gold selling towards zero for the first time in almost a year, 
            writes Adrian Ash at the world-leading precious metals marketplace.


              
           

             Gold demand was positive in France once again, contrasting with the UK and topping Germany for the 6th month running. The number of first-time bullion buyers in Europe's 3rd largest economy also set its highest quarterly total in 3 years amid the political upheaval of the snap election called by President Macron but 
            led so far by Le Pen's National Rally. 
           

              
           

             As a barometer of investor anxiety, in other words, gold demand is currently strongest in France. Gold investing in other Western economies remains soft, but the pace of profit-taking has slowed dramatically, and continued strength in bullion prices signals underlying doubt and uncertainty about the political and financial outlook.
           

              
           

             Used by more than 100,000 private investors from 175 countries – 9-in-10 of them living in Western Europe or North America – BullionVault today cares for $3.3 billion of physical gold (£2.7bn, €3.1bn, ¥542bn), all stored and insured in each client's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich, plus $1.1bn in silver (£866m, €1.0bn, ¥176bn) and $90m (£71m, €84m, ¥14bn) in platinum-group metals.
           

              
           

             Worldwide, the number of investors starting or adding to their physical gold investment in June slipped 12.0% from May's figure to the lowest since March. But the number of people reducing or selling all their holdings across the month fell by 14.4% to the fewest since last June, totalling barely one-third (34.9%) of March's record high.
           

              
           

             Together that edged down the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of private trading behaviour in physical bullion – to 53.9, half-a-point beneath May's 11-month high but 6.4 points above the series low of 47.5 set in March as gold prices surged with the highest quarterly finish since June 2023's reading of 56.2.
           

              
           

             The Gold Investor Index set a decade peak at 65.9 as the Covid pandemic hit Europe and north America in March 2020. Tracking the number of net buyers versus net sellers each month, a reading of 50.0 would signal a perfect balance between the two.
           

              
           




              
           

             While the price of physical bullion in US Dollars slipped 0.7% in June from 
            May's new record monthly gold close of $2346 per Troy ounce, the precious metal set its second quarter-average record in a row, adding 12.9% to $2338 and finishing with a new quarter-end high of $2331.
           

              
           

             Gold for both UK and Euro investors set its 3rd consecutive quarter-average record at £1853 and €2171 respectively and also set new month- and quarter-end highs at £1845 and €2178.
           

              
           

             By weight, investors as a group overall were net sellers yet again on BullionVault, cutting their holdings for the 10th month in a row. But liquidation slowed to its weakest since net selling began last September, totalling just 31 kilograms.
           

              
           

             That small outflow – equal to only 9.1% of the previous 9 months' average net selling and just 3.1% of 
            March's record-heavy investor gold liquidation – took the total quantity of gold bullion now vaulted for customers of the West London fintech down to 45.1 tonnes.
           

              
           

             Within June's action, French investors were net buyers for the 6th month running, the only major market where demand has been positive by weight in 2024 to date, albeit adding only 26 kilograms since New Year. That contrasts with 710kg of selling by UK investors, 406kg from US residents, 161kg from German investors and 28kg from users living in Italy.
           

              
           

             Across the second quarter of 2024, the number of new users in France was greater than the number in Germany for the first time since the end of 2013, jumping by 80.5% from Q1 to set the highest quarterly total since the start of 2021.
           

              
           

             What next? After finishing the first half of 2024 at new quarterly records, the price of gold looks set to continue its underlying uptrend as the UK and US follow France to the polls. That political uncertainty is adding to gold's appeal as investment insurance. And longer-term, the fiscal and monetary backdrop is supportive for gold prices too. Because whether it's far right versus hard left in France, Tory versus Labour in the UK, or Trump versus Biden in the States, a vote against rolling budget deficits isn't on the ballot paper.
           

              
           

             Nor can the electorate vote for or against central banks cutting interest rates now that inflation has stopped making headlines."
2024-07-01,"Title:Sterling's Post-Imperial Warning for the Dollar
Article:BRICS currency forecast redux...

 YOU'VE probably heard that the US economy is heavily 'financialized' writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 What does that really mean? What is financialization?
 It's a big topic and not very well defined. It can refer to the dominance of financial activity over traditional business activity in goods and services. It can refer to market bubbles. It can refer to the use of financial instruments in non-traditional arenas such as warfare or political witch hunts.
 In fact, it refers to all the above and more. Investors need to understand financialization in order not to be blindsided by market activity that defies fundamental analysis.
 We can begin our review of financialization with a look at the role of the US Dollar in global transactions.
 This is not a technical article detailing the plumbing of the financial system. But in considering the role of currencies in global finance, it's important to distinguish between reserves (basically a nation's savings account) and payments (transactions, trade, etc.).
 The denomination of global reserves today is approximately 58% US Dollars and 20% Euros. The remaining 22% is divided among Yen (6%), Sterling (5%), Canadian Dollars (2.5%) and other currencies are each less than 2% (AUD, CNY, CHF).
 In payments (measured in SWIFT message traffic), the US Dollar is about 59% of payments, with the Euro at 13%, Yen at 6%, Sterling at 5% and Yuan and CAD at about 3% each. All other currencies are less than 3% each.
 The relatively larger role of the Dollar in payments is due to higher oil prices and oil being denominated in Dollars. SWIFT message traffic is almost exclusively interbank payments among large banks. There are many bilateral payments (for example, Russian payments to India in local currencies) that do not go via SWIFT.
 There is no immediate threat to the role of the US Dollar in either reserves or payments. I recently debunked the fake news that Saudi Arabia has just ended the petro-Dollar deal that's been in place since 1974.
 Instead there's a slow, steady erosion in the role of the Dollar that could accelerate in the future. A good case study is the decline of Sterling. In 1914, it was the dominant reserve and trade currency. By 1944, it had largely been displaced by the US Dollar as a result of Bretton Woods.
 Today, Sterling is barely a footnote in global reserves and payments. Still, that decline took 30 years (1914-1944) and continued for another 80 years (1944-2024). Major currencies don't simply disappear overnight, but they are subject to these types of declines and gradual displacement by alternatives.
 Contrary to what you hear from a lot of fringe analysts, the Russian Ruble and Chinese Yuan will not displace the US Dollar. Neither currency is widely accepted outside its home country. Those currencies have limited uses and lack large liquid bond markets, and their source countries lack a rule of law. Notions of a 'gold-backed Yuan' are nonsense. China simply doesn't have enough gold.
 A BRICS currency is a more likely alternative to the Dollar for global payments. It won't be issued for several more years. The BRICS are currently expanding their membership and will expand it further at their summit in Kazan, Russia in October.
 That's critical because a larger membership increases the trading zone where the currency can be used. Non-BRICS members can also agree to accept the new BRICS currency if they wish.
 If you receive the BRICS currency in trade, it's more useful if you can spend it or invest it in 20 or 30 other countries rather than just one trading partner as is the case with Rubles, Yuan and Rupees.
 This process of expanding the currency zone with new members will take a few more years, but the infrastructure is being put in place now. The development of the Euro (which took eight years from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty to launch in 2000) is a good model for this.
 While a BRICS currency will be used in trade in a few years, it will take longer to develop as a reserve currency. That requires the creation of a large, liquid bond market, which takes a legal code, issuers, dealers, settlement channels, hedging tools and much more. That process can take 10 years or longer.
 What we should expect is not a sudden collapse of the US Dollar and the US Treasury market in payments and reserves, but rather a slow, steady diminution in the role of the Dollar similar to what happened with Sterling after World War I.
 In the short run, the main alternative to the US Dollar in reserve positions is not another currency, but gold. Central banks have been net purchasers of gold since 2010, reversing their status as net sellers that had prevailed since 1970.
 These net purchases of gold are reflected in increases in gold as a percentage of total reserves. Gold now represents over 70% of US reserves, 25% of Russian reserves and 8% of Chinese reserves.
 Curiously, gold isn't even reported in the IMF's official reserve asset reports, despite the fact that the IMF itself owns over 1,000 metric tonnes of gold. Gold has the added attraction of being a physical, non-digital asset that cannot be frozen or seized by the United States.
 The most conspicuous example of financialization is the use of financial sanctions in warfare. This might better be called the weaponization of the Dollar. US sanctions against Russia have failed badly (as I predicted in 2022) to the point that the Russian economy is now outperforming the US economy by every important metric. The US hasn't learned its lesson and is moving to more dangerous methods.
 The US froze Russian assets (about $300 billion in US Treasury securities) at the start of the war in Ukraine. Now the US is moving to steal those assets. This plan was recently unveiled on June 13 at the G7 summit in Apulia, Italy.
 Russia will retaliate by seizing over $300 billion of Western assets still in Russia. Since the Russian assets are mostly in custody at Euroclear (about $200 billion), Russia can sue Euroclear for wrongful conversion in Russia-friendly jurisdictions where Euroclear has offices including Dubai and Hong Kong.
 Euroclear has about $40 trillion in assets under custody. With a court judgment in hand, Russia could proceed to freeze and seize Euroclear assets on a global basis. This could throw the global financial system into complete chaos.
 Financialization in its many forms is no longer a sideshow. It has become the main event in many arenas. Investors need to follow developments closely in order not to get caught in the political and military crossfire.
 You need to take cover."

Article:So much smarter than the other gold bugs...

 GOLD is misunderstood, but the misunderstanding extends to those critical of others for misunderstanding it, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Because in Wonderland what is, it wouldn't be.
 The subject of this post has been made anonymous, as I've decided to release it to a wider audience. Said subject anonymized those he was critical of and so, turnabout is fair play.
 Elliott Wave technical analyst Mr.Anonymous (Mr.A) has an article explaining his view of why gold is misunderstood by analysts that claim it is a hedge against inflation and a hedge against stock market weakness. On the surface, he is correct. You cannot argue with facts and the facts are that gold has been a less than stellar inflation hedge (under certain inflationary circumstances) and it did go down significantly during Armageddon '08 and the 2020 pandemic crash.
 As noted more times than I care to remember, there are far better hedges against inflation than gold when the inflation manufactured by policymakers is working, albeit temporarily, in support of the economy. Mr.A is also correct in noting that gold went down in the market crash of 2008 and the lesser crash in 2020.
 So what is my beef here?
 Well, we have yet another analyst discussing gold as if it were simply an asset among other assets, focusing on its nominal performance rather than its long-term value and importantly, its relative value when marked up or marked down, as the anti-bubble to most other asset markets, which have been sustained for decades now by a bubble in aggressive and inflationary policy-making.
 It is a bubble that I believe has ended, although it doesn't consciously know it yet, with policy-propped asset markets now little more dead men walking. That assertion is based on several macro indicators I use, but none are more visually striking than the decades long trend break in the 30-year Treasury yield Continuum.
 
 Among other things, that trend break implies that the ease with which policymakers were able to inflate the system at every crisis or even hint of crisis is a thing of the past.
 The sedate bond market signaling gentle disinflation gave license to inflationary policy at every sharp downward turn of the Continuum. That ease and simplicity is history now, and hence the odds have increased that the bubble is done (although still stumbling forward trying to make its way to or through the US presidential election with several fiscal initiatives beyond the scope of this article in play).
 But here is the key point: Gold is the anti-bubble. Its positive correlation with bubble beneficiary markets since it ended its post-2020 corrective phase in Q4 2022 is one of two things: cause for concern about the nominal gold price when stock markets take the next bear, or the beginning of the new macro as gold looks ahead to the obvious end of the policy-induced bubble. When stock markets take the bear, I would not bet on gold merrily going up.
 So there again, on the surface Mr.A is correct. However, it sure as shootin' will outperform.
 Let's take a few quotes and rebut, shall we?
 ""I do not have to go back terribly far in history to prove this premise as being an outright falsehood. First, let's start with early 2020. As the SPX proceeded to crash during the Covid outbreak, did gold rally? Nope. Did gold at least remain stagnant? Nope. In fact, gold proceeded to drop by 15% during that time. Silver was even worse as it lost almost 40% of its value during that same timeframe.""
 Gold is not supposed to rally in nominal terms during crises. It is supposed to retain relative value. This is what gold did in relative terms to SPX during that crisis.
 
 After its relatively moderate nominal decline, gold led most markets out of the abyss before the inflationary bailout operations of central banks and governments set it up for a long correction as cyclical markets regained footing. That was as it should be for the anti-bubble.
 As for silver, it is not gold. I don't know why it is even included in this conversation. Silver is even further from an effective disaster hedge than gold, as it has more cyclical industrial qualities than gold (although it can be a better inflation hedge).
 Now, if you are still not convinced, well, let's go back a bit further to the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Again, did gold rally during this financial upheaval during which the perceived ""safety"" of gold was sorely needed? Nope. Did gold at least remain stagnant? Nope. Gold lost 30% of its value, which clearly outlined that you cannot rely upon gold as a hedge against stock market upheaval.
 And, again, silver was much worse as it lost 60% of its value during this time.
 
 Gold got hammered during Armageddon '08 (which for stocks, actually extended to Q1 2009) but in relative terms it rose strongly vs. SPX and rocketed higher vs. cyclical commodities like oil and base metals. It then went on to out and under perform periodically as cyclical inflation manifested out of the 2008 policy panic and subsequent years of Zero Interest Rate Policy (the financial blight known as ZIRP).
 But, clearly, history did not teach this lesson to everyone, as many completely ignored what occurred during this timeframe, and again expected gold to save them during the Covid crisis. And the many that have still not learned this lesson now come back to prognosticate that gold will provide safety in the event the stock market turns down.
 What is most interesting is that most of these same folks also maintain a world view that gold will not rally alongside the equity market. In fact, I just read another article which outlined this erroneous commonly held view, and claim surprise when it does rally alongside the equity market.
 The point with gold is its relative performance. Nominally, it is going to go up or down as the prevailing winds and varied macro inputs (economic, policy both monetary and fiscal, inflation/deflation, disinflation, psychological/sentiment, etc) dictate. But the big picture macro is what is important.
 Where has it been? Where is it going? What is it indicating?
 As for the ""surprise"" of gold being correlated with asset markets lately, it is already noted above that gold is either being set up for price pressure when a broad bear market ensues or it is diverging to indicate the new macro.
 Mr.A goes on to discuss what I have harped upon for many years, that gold is not usually an effective inflation hedge, at least during the pro-cyclical previous several decades. Let's not dig that up again. Anyone who bothered to look beyond the standard gold bug dogma already knows that. Let's however, rebut one final point.
 ""My friends, at some point, one has to open their eyes and look at markets objectively. Gold is not driven by inflation. Nor is it driven by deflation. Nor is it driven by the Dollar. Nor does it fall when the equity market rallies or vice versa. Gold is driven by market sentiment. And  it is the only constant in the gold market which allows one to maintain an objective perspective on the price trend in gold, and be able to prognosticate that trend in any reliable and consistent manner.""
 Gold's case should not be simplified to only sentiment unless we are discussing the very big macro picture. While sentiment is an important tool in managing an inherently emotional sector like the precious metals, it is far from the only consideration.
 Mr.A is writing in linear fashion, as if the decades of the Continuum's downtrend were still intact. The gold market going forward will respond to policy initiatives and constraints, economic acceleration or more likely in the few years ahead, deceleration. Gold market sentiment is a knock-on effect of what is already happening. That is what sentiment is, a tail chasing the dog. The dog being macro fundamentals and technicals.
 Notice I did not mention war, pestilence (the hard post-pandemic correction for gold was in the bag by mid-2020 due to damaging hype), China/India buying or any of the other common themes put forth as fundamentals for gold. Boiling it down, gold is about policy and sentiment. Aside from being a very long-term holder of real monetary value, gold is a barometer of mass confidence or lack thereof in policymakers in government and finance trying to regulate the economy and associated markets to desired and by definition, manipulated ends.
 So yes, gold is about sentiment. But it is about big-picture sentiment on a societal level. That is why a significant change in the long-term macro is so important. It is going to feed sentiment on a mass scale in the years ahead. My rebuttal seeks to add layers and detail to another analyst's opinion, rather than express outright criticism."

Article:No, bank data doesn't fix China's supply-demand mystery...


              
           


At LAST!
gasps Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             With the gap between China's visible gold supply and visible demand widening yet further so far in 2024, someone has finally checked the data for what's happening to commercial bank holdings of bullion.
           

              
           

             Already the No.1 gold consumer nation, private investors and savers in 
            China poured into gold coins and bars as the price leapt to new all-time highs earlier this year. Surely banking apps and gold-backed products swelled on the Chinese gold rush, too.
           

              
           

             But no! Those numbers don't fix the problem. They only worsen it.
           

              
           

             ""At the end of 2023,"" explains economist Chen Long...
           

              
           

             ...formerly at widely-respected consultancy Gavekal and now co-founder of independent Chinese research consultancy Plenum...
           

              
           

             ""...[China's commercial banks] had roughly 1,016 tonnes of gold. However, 
            their gold holdings have declined massively in the past two years, down about 700 tonnes in 2023 and 600 tonnes in 2022, only rebounding slightly in Q1 2024.""
           

              
           

             Indeed, ""the big four banks cut their holdings in the past two years from 2,064 tonnes to 785 tonnes,"" says Chen, ""with Bank of China cutting the most by 533 tonnes, and the smaller banks have cut theirs as well.""
           

              
           

             Chen's data come crunching the numbers in quarterly reports issued by China's 17 stock-market listed banks. That's something we haven't managed to do here at BullionVault in 2024. No one else we know has done it for 8 years or so, not in public. And Chen's findings now confound what we thought was going on at this spring's new all-time record high gold prices.
           

              
           

             Our guess was that this year's rush into gold by its No.1 private-sector buyers must surely have included a surge in banking products backed by gold.
           

              
           

             First, that's because China is the most advanced nation on Earth for everyone doing everything on mobile apps everywhere, including running their savings and investments.
           

              
           

             Second, China's commercial banks reported huge growth in their customers' gold-linked account holdings when the No.1 consumer market 
            really took off in 2010-2016. So this year's surge in gold coins, bars and even ETF demand would have seen gold-linked banking products surge in size as well.  
           

              
           

             Third, and with bank-account holdings not covered by the data specialists who produce supply and demand figures for the gold market, how else can we explain the gap between China's visible inflows and offtake?
           

              
           




              
           

             No, this table doesn't include gold demand from the Chinese central bank. And rightly not.
           

              
           

             On the official data, the People's Bank of China bought 27 tonnes between January and March. But the PBoC doesn't buy gold in China's domestic market (or so it says) and its purchases in, say, London don't show up in the import figures either, because 'monetary gold' is excluded from those numbers.
           

              
           

             So the Chinese central bank doesn't show up on the demand side of our imbalanced balance above. Nor does our table have a line for China's scrap gold supply...
           

              
           

             ...not from old jewellery or micro-chips...
           

              
           

             ...because no one we know publishes data on that.
           

              
           

             So if anything, the supply-side of our table is too light. That only widens the gap between how much gold flows into private-sector circulation and how much the private sector actually buys.
           

              
           

             And that gap, according to Chen Long, wasn't filled by commercial banks selling gold-linked accounts to their customers. Or rather, not a certain kind of gold-linked product at least.
           

              
           

             ""The recent reductions were triggered by the commercial banks cutting commodity-linked derivatives services for retail customers...The regulators and banks have been much more cautious...The then-chairman of the banking regulator publicly warned in 2021 that 'people who speculate on foreign exchange or gold will have a hard time getting rich.' The same year, several large banks moved to tighten services for retail investors to buy gold. Some banks have completely suspended these services.""
           

              
           

             Such caution and clampdowns aren't news. China, let's remember, is run by an unelected dictatorship which sees its own survival as vital to the long-term safety and security of the nation. That requires tight military, police and political controls. It also means avoiding a financial crisis...
           

              
           

             ...such as the Western world got in 2007-2012...
           

              
           

             ...because wiping out people's savings is never a good look, and...longer-term...an uncontrolled crash would most likely hurt long-term economic growth for the world's 2nd biggest population.
           

              
           

             That would, for starters, deprive younger Chinese citizens of work...
           

              
           

             ...including, for instance, the 
            11 million people graduating from university this year now needing a job.
           

              
           

             Cue the stern warnings from Beijing this month about Chinese government bonds. Its central government debt isn't big. By value, the outstanding total equals less than a quarter of China's annual economic output, in fact.
           

              
           

             That contrasts with UK government debt-to-GDP of 101%, or Italy at 140%, or 
            the USA at 122%.
           

              
           

             But with GDP growth slowing as the real-estate sector slumps, that small pool of sovereign Chinese debt has found ever-more eager buyers in China's massive financial sector. And that has driven the price sharply higher...
           

              
           

             ...as shown by the yield which those bonds offer sinking ever lower as a percentage of the price which people are paying to buy.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""From a macro-prudential perspective,"" said People's Bank boss Pan Gongsheng last week, ""we need to correct and block the accumulation of financial market risks in a timely manner.""
           

              
           

             Most urgently, he warned, people buying bonds at these high prices risk a nasty crash...repeating 
            last spring's Silicon Valley Bank crash in the United States...when interest rates eventually go up and the price of those bonds comes down as a result.
           

              
           

             It's telling that Pan fears an SVB-style crisis. Most banking crashes come when borrowers cannot service their debts, often because interest rates have risen since they took out their loans. But Silicon Valley blew up because it had struggled to find any borrowers...
           

              
           

             ...just like Chinese lenders are 
            currently struggling to find new borrowers...
           

              
           

             ...and so 
            SVB was sitting instead on a pile of customer deposits which it had to park somewhere.
           

              
           

             SVB chose US government bonds, among other stuff, buying Uncle Sam's debt at what proved to be the very top of the Covid Catastrophe, back when yields were low and prices were high.
           

              
           

             By early 2023, the Federal Reserve had hiked interest rates from 0% to two-decade highs at 5% per annum. That meant bond yields also rose sharply. Meaning that bond prices sank. Making SVB unable to pay its customers the cash they had put on deposit.
           

              
           

             Gold of course pays no yield. But its price, like China's government bonds, has jumped in 2024. So too has China's household and investor gold buying.
           

              
           

             Maybe that's why 
            the People's Bank says it bought no gold in May, snapping an 18-month run of publicly-reported purchases at ever-higher prices. Central-bank buying clearly encourages private investment. So if the PBoC thinks gold has got too hot, too fast, maybe holding off for a month might take some of the heat out of household demand?
           

              
           

             Either way, the clampdown on derivatives accounts linked to gold...
           

              
           

             ...where the investor is in fact betting on gold prices...
           

              
           

             ...or perhaps simply on 'unallocated' gold accounts, where the customer gets price exposure but no actual ownership...
           

              
           

             ...means that China's commercial banks need to own less gold to cover their lower exposure to lower customer participation.
           

              
           

             That is, of course, very different to what you enjoy by using BullionVault. Here you are nobody's creditor and no-one owes you anything. Instead, you own your gold (or silver, platinum or palladium) and nobody's financial troubles could deprive you of it.
           

              
           

             That's why, when you study our balance sheet, you will find only $46 million of gold, silver, platinum and palladium on our books (
            page 40 of the 49-page PDF of 'Group of companies' accounts' at Companies House here) rather than the $4.5 billion in client holdings proven on 
            the Daily Audit. Only a small chunk of the total belongs to BullionVault (and only so we can ensure there's an offer for you to buy whenever you wish 24/7). The vast bulk of the metal belongs to customers, not to BullionVault. So it doesn't appear on our balance sheet.
           

              
           

             Maybe a switch to 'allocated' gold might help explain a little of China's deepening gold mystery?
           

              
           

             On Chen's maths, comparing supply against demand, ""A total of 2,700 tonnes of gold has gone missing in China in the past two years...more than half of annual global gold production.""
           

              
           

             That is a lot. It's worth about US$200 billion...
           

              
           

             ""...so much that it is unlikely that one mysterious buyer holds all of it. There are several possibilities that could explain where it has gone.""
           

              
           

             Chen's possibilities include the People's Bank buying gold in the domestic market but not reporting it. Or maybe China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, has been buying gold and not reporting it either.
           

              
           

             Another possibility ""is that there are other buyers we do not see,"" he adds...again suggesting state-run demand. Or maybe some investors have switched from domestic to foreign banks ""who also have gold import licenses [and] may have increased their [Chinese] gold holdings without making disclosures.""
           

              
           

             Or maybe, Chen suggests, China's own commercial banks haven't cut their holdings as much as their quarterly reports suggest? And maybe, we think here at BullionVault, that might be because their customers now want allocated gold, securely stored and insured in a vault in their name, rather than a credit risk or even derivatives product.
           

              
           

             Look, China has, over the past couple of years, been living through a protracted real estate slump, something akin to a 'Lehmans moment' of fear, doubt and mistrust, with the stock market almost halving in value from New Year 2021 to February this year.
           

              
           

             The web of who owes what to whom remains impossible to untangle, right up until someone goes bust and their creditors have to tell their own creditors that the whole thing is unravelling. And just as the Western world's 'global' financial crisis saw a surge in allocated gold investing after the Lehmans' crisis had hit, so China is now facing the very real problem of who to stick with the losses from the past two decades of over-development and 
            the 'ghost cities' it has left behind.

Article:Spike in palladium price follows record bearish betting...


              
           


BEARISH betting against palladium prices set another fresh record in Nymex futures and options last week new data shows, just ahead of the precious metal spiking almost 1/5th in price on a sudden 'short squeeze'.
           

              
           

             Finding over 4/5ths of its end-use from autocatalyst demand to reduce harmful emissions from gasoline-engine vehicles, palladium today retreated to $940 per Troy ounce, down 8.7% from Friday's short-squeeze peak.
           

              
           

             That's barely 1/3rd the record prices hit during the post-Covid supply squeeze of 2021 and then the 
            all-out invasion of Ukraine by Russia – palladium's No.1 mining nation – in early 2022.
           

              
           

             The total share of petrol and diesel cars sold in Europe last month fell below 50%, trade association Acea said last week. But May also 
            saw battery electric vehicles – which don't require any palladium or other platinum-group metal catalysts – fall to 12.5% of new car sales, down from 13.8% twelve months before and confirming 
            the slowdown in BEV adoption.
           

              
           

             Hybrid-electrics in contrast – primarily combining electric power with a petrol engine needing a palladium or platinum autocat – grew from 25% to nearly 30%.
           

              
           




              
           

             Latest data from US regulators the CFTC, delayed until Monday by last week's Juneteenth holiday, show that net of bullish bets, bearish betting against palladium by speculative traders reached its 3rd new all-time record in a row last week.
           

              
           

             In a market where end-user demand is forecast to outstrip global supply by 35.1 tonnes in 2024, the negative Managed Money position recorded last Tuesday equated to 50.0 tonnes of bullion, almost twice the size of the 'specs' average net bullish position since 2006.
           

              
           

             That CFTC data – tracking trader positioning in the CME derivatives exchange's Nymex palladium futures and options contracts – was taken as the precious metal hit a 360-week Tuesday low at $872 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             From there, 
            palladium prices in the spot market then spiked by 18.1% to Friday afternoon's peak at $1030.
           

              
           

             Dealers in the physical palladium market last week reported growing demand to borrow the metal, suggesting fresh bearish betting through 'OTC' contracts as well as through Nymex futures and options.
           

              
           

             ""The availability of palladium bars was 
            especially tight in London,"" adds Reuters, citing industry sources.
           

              
           

             Trading volumes in London's physical palladium market had already leapt in the week-ending 14 June according to trade data reported by members of the London Bullion Market Association, rising by 30.0% from the previous week while gold trading slid by 14.7% with silver and platinum volumes little changed.
           

              
           

             ""Given [palladium's] significant deficit"" between supply and demand, says specialist analyst Wilma Swarts, head of platinum-group metals at data providers and consultancy 
            Metals Focus, ""above-ground stocks have declined to their lowest levels in our records"" dating back to 1980.
           

              
           

             ""Deficits are [also] expected in 2024 and 2025. This will further tighten liquidity and is likely to lift or support prices this year.""
           

              
           

             Since early February, when the price of palladium bullion hit its lowest since August 2017 at $876 per Troy ounce, the Managed Money's net bearish betting in CME Nymex contracts has grown by one quarter to last week's fresh record high.
           

              
           

             Led by investment company abrdn's Physical Palladium Shares product (NYSEArca: PALL), the total size of palladium-backed ETFs worldwide has meantime risen to the highest since New Year 2019 according to data from Bloomberg.
           

              
           

             But those products as a group remain 4/5ths smaller than their 2015 peak, and the 2nd largest such palladium ETF – the closed-end Sprott palladium product (TSE: SPPP) – ended last night at a discount of 3.3% to the value of the metal held in trust to back its shares, suggesting weak investor interest.
           

              
           

             ""Slower EU car sales in H2'24 could drag on palladium demand,"" says German refining and precious-metals technology group Heraeus.
           

              
           

             But ""platinum deficits [between global supply and demand] could be deeper than our base case,"" says the mining industry's

2024-06-21,"Title:Silver Investing: Which Country Wins Euro 2024?
Article:Private investment in silver ranked for the 24 nations... 


WHOEVER wins the silverware at football's UEFA Euro 2024 Championship this summer, the winner in silver bullion investing is already clear, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             From the 24 nations competing to lift the Henri Delaunay trophy on 14 July, investors in Hungary top the league table for largest average silver holdings at BullionVault, the world-leading marketplace for private investment in precious metals. Behind comes Portugal, followed by Switzerland and Austria for the heaviest median investment in 
            buying vaulted silver bullion online.
           

              
           

             For total silver holdings by country, BullionVault's home nation England wins, followed by Germany, France and the Netherlands.
           

              
           
 Euro Football Championships Silver Investment Holdings

              
           

              
           

Note: This table of silver investment holdings among the Euro 2024 countries uses the median average, not the mean. So it shows the typical silver holdings among BullionVault users in each footballing nation, with half of them owning more and half of them less than the figure given. Sort the table by clicking the column headings.


              
           

             While the price of gold has been winning the financial headlines this spring, surging to new record highs, silver has outperformed its precious-metal cousin, rising 23.9% for UK investors – almost twice the 12.7% rise in gold prices – since New Year's Eve.
           

              
           

             Reaching the highest prices since 2011, silver has also beaten this year's other stellar investments to date, outpacing copper (up 14.5%) and even the Nasdaq index of US tech stocks (up 19.1%) but lagging Bitcoin (up 50.3%).
           

              
           

             Making winners of investors choosing to buy silver ahead of this surge, these big 2024 gains come as 
            silver's critical role in industry and new technologies – especially green energy – sees global demand for the precious metal outstrip new mining supply for the second year running. Vital to solar energy panels as the conductive layer in photovoltaic cells, silver is also crucial in electrical networks and in electronics, too. 
           

              
           

             Analysts predict that demand for silver jewellery is also rising in 2024, along with demand for silver ornaments, cutlery and other silverware. 
           

              
           

             The current Henri Delaunay trophy – named after the first General Secretary of UEFA – was made by London jewellers Asprey in 2008. Made from 8 kilograms of Sterling silver, the cup contains £5,468 of bullion at today's prices. While it represents one of 
            the world's most coveted trophies, it is lighter than the Premier League trophy (9.5kg without its base) but slightly heavier than the UEFA Champions League trophy (7.5kg) or FA Cup (6.3kg).
           

              
           

             Altogether, users of BullionVault today own 1,164 tonnes of silver – worth £866 million today, and enough to make 157,380 Euro trophies – all stored and insured inside high-security vaults. More than half of it is held in Switzerland (53.9%), one third in London (37.5%), plus a little in Singapore (6.4%) and Toronto (2.1%).
           

              
           

             Unlike silver coins or small bars bought from retail dealers, all silver traded on BullionVault is free of VAT sales tax, avoiding the 20% surcharge which UK residents otherwise face. That enables the investor to win much larger gains when the precious metal rises in value."
2024-06-18,"Title:Annual Price Patterns in Gold, Silver, Platinum
Article:20 years' precious metal prices changes by month as H2 2024 begins...


              
           


PRECIOUS METALS analysts often speak about a seasonal shape in the gold market.
           

              
           

             That's because, over recent decades, gold prices have sometimes seen a rise in the New Year and spring, followed by a summer drop or lull, and then a further rise into year-end.
           

              
           

             Some analysts link that pattern to seasonal changes in 
            global demand for gold. They see those price changes leading what happens to silver and platinum prices between January and December, too. 
           

              
           

             After surging to new all-time US Dollar highs in March, April and May this year, might the second half of 2024 repeat the more seasonally typical pattern? The infographics below show you how gold prices have moved across the calendar year over the last two decades.
           

              
           

             The first chart lets you count how many times, over the last 20 years, each month showed a gain for gold in either US Dollar terms, or Euros, British Pounds or Japanese Yen.
           

              
           

             The second infographic then shows you the last 20 years' average monthly price change for gold in those 4 major currencies, too.
           

              
           

              
           

              
           

              
           

              
           

             Whatever pattern you might or might not see in the chart, consumer gold demand does have a clear seasonal pattern.
           

              
           

             Demand in China – now the world's heaviest gold consumer nation, outpacing former No.1 India 15% by weight each year – peaks with Chinese New Year. That's followed by Valentine's Day, and then the festive season of Akshaya Tritiya in southern India.
           

              
           

             The summer brings a lack of festivals or weddings on India's Hindu calendars, before household demand in the No.2 consumer nation jumps in the run-up to Diwali. Followed by Christmas – the peak gifting season across Europe and the Americas – that then runs into retailer stockpiling for the Chinese New Year again.
           

              
           

             Consumer demand is not the only factor which can affect gold prices however. Rising assets tend to require inflows of investor cash, both driving and chasing prices higher.
           

              
           

             With that in mind, check out January's track record for rising precious metal prices. Because, as our interactive chart shows, gold has risen 14 times at New Year in US Dollar terms since 2004. Silver rose 13 times and platinum has risen more repeatedly still, up 17 times in the last 20 Januarys.
           

              
           

             So the New Year clearly invites strong investing into precious metals. Here at 
            BullionVault, in fact – the world's largest online investment service for physical precious metals – January has repeatedly seen more new bullion investors than the following year's monthly average, and it was the very best month of the year for new account openings 3 times in the last decade.
           


               
            

              Why this repeated surge of interest at New Year?
            

               
            

              Gold may benefit because investors use the start of January to review their portfolio and rebalance their holdings of bullion, equities and bonds.
            

               
            


             January may also bring heavy demand to 
            invest in gold because – looking at the 12 months ahead – wealth managers and private savers alike focus on potential risks to their money. So they choose to buy a little investment insurance for protection.
           

              
           


              That would help explain why January is the best single month for gold gains over the last 20 years for US Dollar investors, matched only by November's strike rate between 2004 and 2023. But November doesn't come close to January's average monthly gain, lagging the New Year's figure of 2.9% with an average 1.6% rise.
            

               
            

              Even so, note also that December is catching up. Over the last decade in fact, it now matches January's strike rate, with the gold price in Dollar terms rising 7 times. Maybe that reflects wholesalers buying in China, preparing for Lunar New Year demand by stockpiling metal sooner than later. Perhaps it also reflects short-term traders spotting the January bump and buying early, effectively betting on a repeat of the seasonal pattern.
            

               
            

              Past performance is no guarantee of future performance, of course. And what drives this New Year pop in bullion prices isn't 100% clear either. But history says that, over the last 2 decades on average, early summer made a good time to buy gold, as well as silver or platinum, ahead of solid gains later in the year and then that repeated rise in January."

            Joong Ang news site, ""an office worker entered a GS25 convenience store in Gangnam, Seoul and 
            stopped in front of a golden vending machine.
           

              
           

             ""The product which Ms.Oh chose was 1g of 24K pure gold.""
           

              
           

             Her price for 1 gram of gold?
           

              
           

             Ms.Oh apparently paid 160,000 Won for that tiny nugget...
           

              
           

             ...exactly 50% above the value of the bullion it contained that day...
           

              
           

             ...and dearer even than the kind of profit margins you would shell out for a 1 gram flake from the leading US or even UK retail gold outlets.
           

              
           

             But eager buyers in Korea can actually pay steeper mark-ups to join this hot trend if they like. The half-gram flake spat out by GS Retail's vending machine 
            costs 68% above spot according to numbers published by Bloomberg...
           

              
           

             ...also filing a breathless report from ""the corner of a bustling street in Seoul's affluent Gangnam district."" Maybe the same corner of the same street, perhaps.
           

              
           

             Look, I don't know what the gold-business numbers at convenience store GS Retail really look like.
           

              
           

             But last June, the firm said it had sold around $19 million of gold through its vending machines in Korea across a 9-month trial.
           

              
           

             Whereas in June 2024, ""Currently we are seeing about 30 million Won of sales per month,” says a GS spokesperson 
            to the media...
           

              
           

             ...less than $22,000 in US Dollar terms in total, and barely $700 per machine per month from the 30 units which GS says it has installed so far.
           

              
           

             So across 3 months, that would equate to maybe $65,000 of total gold-vending machine sales in Korea...
           

              
           

             ...home to a coin and small-bar market 
            which saw total net demand reach over $300m across January to March according to data gathered by specialists Metals Focus and published by the mining industry's World Gold Council.
           

              
           

             Put another way, the headline above this latest rash of gold ATM stories should say at best that ""Vending machines grab 0.02% of Korea's retail gold investing market""...
           

              
           

             ...rather than 
            pretending that ""Young Koreans flock to 'gold vending machines' as prices soar"".
           

              
           

             But that's not how PR or the news media work. If it were, how much coverage do you think 
            the Costco gold nonsense would have bagged earlier this spring? And why would the idea of gold ATMs just keep coming back, year after year? 
           

              
           

             ""Today, the world's first 'Gold To Go-Machine' is being presented to an international audience at Frankfurt Airport,"" said a press release from long-gone German company TG Gold-Super-Markt 
            exactly 15 years ago Sunday.
           


               
            


             ""This is more than a marketing gimmick,"" claimed the founder and boss...
           

              
           

             ...even as he also told the 
            New York Times that, 
            yeah, actually, it was just a marketing gimmick to try promoting his retail gold bullion store.
           

              
           

             Whether or not the thing ever turned a profit, or succeeded in boosting the coin shop's sales, the internet doesn't say today. The only traces that remain are the gushing press stories from each time the Gold To Go ATM turned up in a new location...
           

              
           

             ...whether 
            Abu Dhabi in mid-May 2010...
           

              
           

             ...or 
            Florida that December...
           

              
           

             ...or even London (!) at the 
            Westfield shopping mall in July 2011.
           

              
           

             None of those machines are still there, of course. Not because of sledgehammers or bulldozers, but because the PR buzz came and went. And came again. Only to go again. But that still hasn't stopped other people trying the idea too!
           

              
           

             ""Master Gold Egypt has partnered with local e-payment technology company Finway to launch the first gold ATM in Egypt,"" 
            said the local press in one of gold's hottest Middle East markets last November.
           

              
           

             ""Details regarding the precise location have not yet been revealed.""
           

              
           

             Same in India, world No.2 for private-sector gold demand. ""ATM now dispenses gold coins"" 
            gushed the local press back in late 2022.
           

              
           

             ""Gold ATMs are expanding! More locations to turn cash into gold""
           

              
           

             But so far, 18 months after launch, 
            only 2 are operating according to GoldSikka, the company behind India's own rash of gold ATM hype and hope...
           

              
           

             ...one of them at its own office.
           

              
           

             Why does the world's media keep falling for this stuff, time after time?
           

              
           

 First, gold plus ATM is a great story. Bubblegum for the brain, yes, and not actually an important trend or technology anywhere in reality. But I mean, gold out of a vending machine? What click-seeking news editor wouldn't love that?
 Second, gold gets such little coverage most of the time...especially in the West...that journalists and financial editors can sometimes display the collective memory of a goldfish. Besides, who cares if the story is nonsense, whether for the first or 10th time? Just count those clicks and resulting advert impressions!
 Third, and in the first-half of 2024 specifically, the price of gold has surged to new record highs. Something must explain it. And besides, clicks!


             So while you don't need me to explain how a couple of 1-gram bars simply aren't part of gold's recent all-time highs, some of the people paid to write about our market seem to need help.
           

              
           

             Take the Costco gold story, for instance.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Gold prices red hot as Costco gets in on gold rush,"" gasped 
            Forbes magazine in April, repeating PR the US-based discount store had already been pumping out for 6 months and more in the USA and UK (and which began way back in 2020 in, umm, Iceland).
           

              
           

             The headline suggested that sales of small gold bars at Costco were somehow driving gold higher. Which was, of course, pure nonsense.
           

              
           

             But like we noted earlier this spring, ""Fade the detail versus the impact"" when it comes to 
            this Costco gold frenzy. Because as Swiss refining giant MKS Pamp's strategist Nicky Shiels has since put it, 
            ""What matters is sentiment...
           

              
           

             ""Media coverage has exploded,"" she explains...writing in the London Bullion Market Association's 
            Alchemist magazine...""with featured articles in CNBC, 
            New York Times, FoxBusiness and Axios (to name a few), and a segment on Good Morning America (GMA) bringing inflation fears and gold bars into Americans' living rooms.""
           

              
           

             Hence the jump in Google searches for the words ""Costco gold"" shown on MKS' chart above. Thanks to the PR juggernaut, it even overtook the words ""buy gold"" among searches in April worldwide!
           

              
           

             Perhaps that signals something big, like Shiels at MKS says...
           

              
           

             ...the start of a new phase for gold investment, where PR hype and everyday shopping trips collide to make the idea of buying bullion a regular, ordinary and more widespread thing than ever before.
           

              
           

             Against that, however, comes the blunt fact of USA and other Western households 
            staying shy of gold overall so far this year. Indeed, and in terms of actual behaviour, the biggest jump for precious metals in North America and Western Europe so far this year has been to sell gold...
           

              
           

             ...not to buy it with both hands like emerging-market central banks and Chinese households have done.
           

              
           

             Yes, Google searches for the words ""sell gold"" have continued to lag behind ""buy gold"" so far this year. But they 
            came closer to matching it this April than even at the top of the global financial crisis (and the peak of the 'cash for gold' scrap boom) back in 2011, albeit not as close as during 
            2022's sudden profit-taking in gold when Russia invaded Ukraine.
           

              
           

             What people type into Google and what they actually do, in other words, can be two different things. But those words do offer a guide to sentiment...
           

              
           

             ...not least to the pent-up bullish frenzy which financial journalists and editors in the West have seemed so keen to urge into being in the first half of 2024."
2024-06-13,"Title:The $12,000 EV vs. Tesla
Article:What Biden's tariffs on China mean...

 The BIDEN administration announced significant tariff increases on China, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Targeting roughly $18 billion in strategic industries, there's a sharp focus on electric vehicles (EVs). These tariffs, which quadruple to 100% on Chinese-made EVs, are designed to counter China's unfair trade practices and overcapacity while boosting US industries.
 The move also aims to strengthen President Biden's lagging poll numbers heading into the November presidential election.
 For decades, China has moved to dominate various industries, from toys and clothing in the 1980s to semiconductors and renewable energy today. As of now, China produces a third of the world's manufactured goods, surpassing the combined output of the US, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK This industrial might has given China a trade surplus in manufactured goods equal to a 10th of its entire economy.
 The world's second largest economy was a minor player in car exports just four years ago, shipping about 1 million low-priced vehicles annually to less affluent markets. Today, China has surged past Japan and Germany to become the world's biggest car exporter, with shipments running at an annual pace of nearly 6 million vehicles. China's car exports, in fact, hit a record high in April, with a year-on-year increase of 38%.
 As for EVs, domestic Chinese sales have been strong and are growing. Last year, consumers purchased some 6.6 million EVs, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). That represents a nearly 25% increase from the number of EV sales during the previous year, and a remarkable 128% jump from 2021.
 Annual Chinese Sales of Battery Powered Vehicles (BEVs)
 
 And demand doesn't appear to be slowing down. China is reportedly introducing as many as 71 models of EVs this year, many of them equipped with advanced features and priced lower than comparable models in the West.
 The model that has US companies worried is the Seagull, a small EV manufactured by BYD (""Build Your Dreams"") that sells for around $12,000. Some people are already calling BYD a ""Tesla killer,"" but with a 100% tariff imposed on the company's vehicles, it's unlikely that you're going to see them on US roads and highways anytime soon.
 Historically, China has benefited from substantial subsidies, a key gripe from American and European business leaders and politicians. Chinese subsidies relative to GDP are about three times higher than in France and about four times higher than in Germany or the US, according to a report by the Germany-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
 This is what allows companies to price their vehicles at such artificially low costs.
 
 President Biden's tariffs aren't just about pushing back against China's unfair trade practices; they're also about protecting American industries.
 Through the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden has already provided support to American companies in sectors like semiconductors and renewable energy. The tariff increases on China are an extension of that protection, ensuring that American businesses can compete on a more level playing field.
 As I said earlier, we should view Biden's actions through the lens of the upcoming US presidential election. President Biden is trailing former President Donald Trump in national polls, including in several swing states, and this move is likely aimed at rallying support among voters who are concerned about job losses and industrial decline.
 Having said all that, tariffs are not ideal instruments, and I believe they should be used sparingly. It's important to remember that tariffs are taxes paid not by the exporting country – China in this case – but by importers, which pass the additional cost on to domestic consumers.
 Biden's tariffs could also have unintended consequences on the nation's efforts to decarbonize its grid, warns the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC-based think tank. China is the largest exporter of lithium-ion batteries to the US, which are crucial for grid storage that complements solar power. Depending on the details of the tariffs, US efforts to transition to renewable energy could face slowdowns if storage capacity is impacted.
 Another factor to consider is the declining consumer demand for EVs in the US According to the J.D. Power 2024 US Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study, the percentage of new vehicle buyers considering an EV has dropped for the first time since 2021. Key issues include a shortage of affordable models, concerns about charging infrastructure and limited consumer understanding of EV incentives. Economic factors like lower fuel prices and high inflation further dent demand.
 Remarkably, Biden's tariffs aren't the worst-case scenario for China. Trump has said he would impose 60% tariffs on all imports from China if reelected, which Bloomberg Economics estimates would effectively eliminate all trade between the two nations.
 With EVs gaining in popularity across the globe and governments spending to build out wind and solar facilities, we're seeing prices for key metals and materials start to break out. Copper futures have recently hit a record high, while nickel prices are breaking out on near-term supply concerns.
 Unrest in New Caledonia, a French territory in the South Pacific and the world's number three nickel producer, has disrupted output of the white metal, which is used in the production of batteries. Nickel traded above $21,000 per metric ton last week for the first time in about a month.
 
 Biden's sweeping tariff increases on China are a calculated move to protect American industries, counter unfair trade practices and gain political clout ahead of the November election. While these measures are necessary to level the playing field, they come with challenges and potential unintended consequences. As investors, it's important to stay informed and understand the broader implications of these policies on the market and the economy."
2024-06-12,"Title:How the Bond Market Works
Article:Or how it should, amid excess credit, capital shortage...

 The AUTHOR and journalist Michael Lewis claims that when he wrote 'Liar's Poker', which was published 35 years ago, he meant it as a cautionary tale, writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.
 The book happens to be required reading, not just for anyone seeking an insight into the ways of Wall Street in the late 1980s, but simply for anyone, full stop.
 It's a terrific read, and it charts a period during which something approximating to 'gentlemanly capitalism' was taken over, wholesale; first by street-smart traders from the likes of the Bronx and London's East End, and then by quantitative analysts (geeks, in other words, but with PhDs).
 It also details a period during which the bond market started to dominate every other facet of the investment world. ""I used to think that if there was reincarnation,"" said Clinton political adviser James Carville once, ""I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter.
 ""But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.""
 'Liar's Poker' portrays a world in which cunning slobs stole dealing rooms from under the noses of patrician blue-bloods born on the right side of the tracks. If that implies chaos, that's exactly right.
 But cautionary tale? The book became 'must-read' material for an entire generation of undergraduates on both sides of the Atlantic. It acted like a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking up mathematicians and philosophy students and economics third-years and liberal arts graduates, and spitting them back out across dealing rooms in New York and London's Square Mile.
 For all we know, it still does. This correspondent speaks as an English graduate whose first job, courtesy of exposure to 'Liar's Poker', was – like Michael Lewis – selling bonds for an international investment bank.
 The bond market may be intimidating, but it shouldn't be. A bond is about the most basic financial instrument you could imagine. Think of a loan that happens to be tradable, daily.
 That's a bond.
 So let's put some more meat on the bone. Who issues bonds? Anyone that needs to borrow money. That means governments, corporations, and supranational borrowers like the World Bank.
 Entities, especially private companies, often prefer to borrow in the bond market because they don't want to dilute existing shareholders by means of issuing equity. US companies also often prefer to issue bonds as opposed to stock because the interest on bonds is deductible on the company's income tax return. Dividends on stock are not.
 The bond market is an almost entirely institutional market. Private investors barely feature – not least because the average traded size for a bond deal in the secondary market is approximately $5 million or so.
 How do bonds get issued? In a way that's very similar to equity underwriting. A consortium of investment banks will gauge the market's level of interest in the issue by speaking to their clients – large pension funds, insurers, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. When they've assessed the market's demand for the issue, the size of the borrowing will be agreed, and its price, and then the bonds will be free to trade. Voila.
 Bond math is pretty straightforward, too. Let's take a real world example. (Market professionals can skip the next few paragraphs.)
 A corporate issuer – let's call them 'General Industrial' – decides to borrow $5 billion in the bond market at an interest rate of 5%, maturing in 10 years' time, on 3rd June 2034. Let's say you're a pension fund and you decide to buy $1 million worth of the issue at launch. You will pay 100% of the bond's face value, or what's known as par. So the stream of cash flows looks as follows:
 Launch date: you pay General Industrial (or more specifically, the investment bank from whom you bought the bond) $1000,000.
 3rd June 2025: General Industrial pays you $50,000 (5% of your $1000,000). 3rd June 2026: General Industrial pays you another $50,000. 3rd June 2027: General Industrial pays you another $50,000...(you get the picture).
 ...and on 3rd June 2034, General Industrial pays you a last coupon payment of $50,000 – and it also pays you your original principal of $1000,000 back.
 As you can see from this example, bond interest payments, or what are called coupons, are typically fixed. And the redemption of your initial capital is fixed, too, at 100%.
 This means that in a high inflation environment, bonds are generally poor investments. The converse is also true. In a deflationary environment, where prices are actually falling, bonds are generally great investments, because the purchasing power of your capital is actually improving, relative to those falling prices.
 It's important to know that you're not locked in to holding this bond until it matures in June 2034. You can sell it any time you like. Although the coupon is only paid once a year (bonds typically pay annual or semi-annual coupons), if you decide to sell it before the coupon date, you'll be compensated for any accrued interest that you've earned but not been paid.
 And it's also critically important to know that if General Industrial is unable to pay the interest it owes you, or to repay the initial capital when the bond matures, you may lose everything.
 For this reason, almost all bonds carry a credit rating from a major ratings agency like Moody's or Standard & Poor's. Credit ratings range from 'AAA' (impeccable) all the way down to 'D' – meaning the company is in default. 'Investment grade ratings' (the best sort) range from 'AAA' to 'BBB-'. Anything below that is considered 'junk', or more politely, 'high yield'.
 So what influences the price of bonds? The major factors are: the likely direction of future interest rates; the likely direction of inflation; supply and demand for the bonds in question; and the perceived credit quality of the issuer.
 One final word on bond math. There is one thing close to an iron law in economics. If interest rates go up, bond prices typically fall. (The converse is also true.)
 Why? Remember, those interest payments, or coupons, are typically fixed. The capital amount returned when the bond matures is also fixed, too. So if interest rates rise while you're holding the bond, the value of those fixed payments essentially is diminished in real terms. But because the bond trades every day, bond traders can adjust the price of the bond, which in turn will adjust the yield that the bond offers.
 If you buy that General Industrial bond at a price of 100 when it's issued, because the coupon is fixed at 5%, your yield will be 5%, too. Over its life, if the price falls below 100, your yield (what bond traders call 'yield to maturity') will rise. And clearly, if investors raise their opinion of General Industrial's credit quality, then the price of the bonds is likely to rise too. But the critical point is the one we just made:
 If interest rates go up, bond prices typically fall.
 Before we leave the subject of bonds altogether, it's also worth saying a few words about the nature of bond fund managers. Institutional bond funds typically invest on an indexed or benchmarked basis. That is to say, they will tend to own bonds in line with the make-up of an accredited bond index, such as the JP Morgan Government Bond Index.
 Think about that one more time. A bond fund tracking a bond index is effectively obliged to have its largest positions in the largest bond markets. This is a bit like saying you can lend to one of two friends. One of your friends wants to borrow $10, and is good for the loan. The other wants to borrow $1000,000 – and is frankly unlikely to pay it back. You are obliged to make the loan to your second friend, who's clearly a credit risk. Welcome to the perverse and dangerous logic of international bond investing. We think this will end in tears.
 A modern economy is clearly a complex structure, so rather than have to get a PhD in advanced economics just to conduct credit research on any given government bond market, most investors leave the credit analysis to the likes of those ratings agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch IBCA.
 But at the risk of appearing overly deferential to those same agencies, the subprime mortgage disaster showed that they can have feet of clay. Collateralised debt obligations (packages of subprime loans) were rated 'AAA' one day and defaulted the next.
 So for the avoidance of any doubt, take credit ratings with more than a pinch of salt. Remember that credit ratings agencies are paid by the same borrowers for whom they provide credit ratings – a larger conflict of interest would be difficult to imagine.
 If you're in need of a further jolt of realism, visit the US debt clock. The site confirms that the US national debt now stands at just under $35 trillion. With a 't'. That equates to debt per taxpayer of roughly $267,000. That's the good news. When you factor in the unfunded liabilities of the US government (the likes of Social Security and Medicare), the US debt comes to well over $200 trillion. Also with a 't'.
 We humbly submit that these debts will not be paid back. They cannot be paid back. The US national debt is like a neutron star: an incalculably dense mass that crushes everything that comes towards it.
 But ratings agency Fitch cheerfully gives the US a credit rating of 'AA+', its second highest rating. Ominously, though, it downgraded the US from its highest rating of 'AAA' in August 2023.
 With hindsight it made absolute sense to buy US Treasuries in the early 1980s, for example. The oil shocks of the 1970s had given rise to years of stagflation and it was only Fed chairman Paul Volcker's determination to squeeze inflation out of the system through the tough love of higher interest rates that brought bond markets back under control.
 And how. Starting in 1982, Treasury yields started to drop (bond yields move inversely to bond prices – so lower yields means a bond market rally), and they fell precipitously.
 By mid-2020, 10 year US Treasury yields were trading below 1%. But that was then.. They are now back above 4% – and we think they are heading higher. The market consensus does not agree with us.
 But there's worse news to come. Treasury yields are only as low as they are due to the Federal Reserve's policy of Quantitative Easing (QE). QE was ""designed"" as a means of boosting the economy through the provision of additional liquidity into the banking system. The Fed would create 'ex nihilo' money – money out of thin air – and use it to buy bonds in the secondary market from the banks. Gifted free cash through these bond sales, the banks would then lend out this newly created cash to those who wanted to borrow. That was the theory.
 In practice, all that's really happened is that QE has blessed a small proportion of the population – those lucky individuals fortunate or successful enough to hold large amounts of financial assets. QE has been an extraordinary boon to the asset rich. Equity prices, bond prices, housing prices have all benefited from a colossal leakage of money from the banking system into the financial markets. But this leakage has now been officially ended.
 This doesn't mean that interest rates are immediately going to rise. But the formal cessation of the latest round of QE is equivalent to a sea change in US monetary policy. At some point, interest rates must rise. And to repeat, if interest rates go up, bond prices tend to fall.
 And because the West is drowning in bonds, the impact of a bear market in bonds is incalculable.
 If you accept our argument that the investment world is beset by a type of uncertainty genuinely never seen before – one that incorporates interest rate risk, default risk and currency risk on a literally global scale – then it makes sense to hold a type of asset that is either unexposed to those risks or that offers the potential to insure your portfolio against them. That asset is gold.
 ""We have an abundance of money and credit..."" writes our friend Tony Deden, a money manager in Zurich,
 ""...but a shortage of capital. We have sought to substitute form over substance, credit over savings, and consumption over production. We have eaten our capital...we live in dismal times and we suffer from a moral crisis, both being consequences of a [50-year old] experiment in dishonest money.
 ""In the end, the consequences of monetary folly have not been addressed but only postponed. The errors have not been cleared but merely covered up with money and false accounting. Money printing can buy time but not wealth. All roads lead to default and impoverishment of some sort. The only question that remains is what road will be taken.""
 The beauty of gold versus all other types of asset is that it is the only one that is also no-one else's liability. It is independent, scarce, and permanent. That cannot be said of any fiat currency. As you might expect, we regard gold not just as an industrial commodity, but as an alternative form of money.
 One of Tony's directors once made a highly pertinent observation about what gold actually is:
 ""Gold is not an investment. It is a conscious decision to refrain from investing until an honest monetary regime makes the rational calculation of relative asset prices possible.""
 Suffice to say, the return of an honest monetary regime may be some time off. But precisely because we don't know what the future holds, and because the threats to our purchasing power are numerous and very real, we maintain that gold has a place in any balanced portfolio today.
 Incrementum AG:
 ""One of our central theses of recent years is now being slowly but surely confirmed: (Government) bonds are no longer the antifragile portfolio foundation they have been for the last 40 years. After yields reached a microscopically low level in 2020 and were even negative in some cases, 10-year US Treasuries fell in value by 22.8%, while 30-year bonds even fell by 48.8% from their peak. The frontrunners in the negative sense are naturally the 100-year Austrian bonds, which are down 69.1 % (maturity 2120) from their respective highs.
 ""It almost seems as if the bond vigilantes are back. Coined by Ed Yardeni in 1983, the term refers to activist investors who indirectly control government policy by buying and selling government bonds. These ""financial sheriffs"" send a clear signal against excessive government debt and inflation by driving up interest rates through the sale of bonds. Today, in a time of financial repression and open central bank interventionism, their role may seem weakened. But the bond vigilantes are not obsolete – they are adapting to the new market realities and remain an important corrective to fiscal slippage.
 ""A historical example of the impact of bond vigilantes was the bond market reaction to the overexpansive fiscal policy of the Reagan era in the early 1980s. Higher deficits led to a rise in government bond yields, which ultimately prompted the government to tighten its budget policy. Another example is the European sovereign debt crisis in the early 2010s, when investors questioned the creditworthiness of southern European countries and drastically increased the interest burden for these countries by selling PIIGS bonds.
 ""And the playbook is likely to have changed not only for gold but also for bonds. Recently, US government bonds have increasingly exhibited characteristics of traditional risk-on investments. In times of financial unrest, their yields rose – a clear contrast to the previous trading pattern that dominated for decades. This new behaviour is reminiscent of the performance of emerging-market government bonds, which are traditionally more sensitive to global risk sentiment. This transformation marks a significant departure from the previous role of [US Treasuries] as a safe haven, and it requires a rethink in strategic allocation.""
 In common with Incrementum, we think much has changed. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that our wealth management competitors still see merit in the so-called '60/40 portfolio' (60% equities; 40% bonds; both benchmarked against traditional market weight indices), we see none whatsoever. We see no merit in fiat currencies or bonds issued by heavily indebted sovereigns that have no realistic way out of their current debt predicament other than via an explicit and highly repressive policy of state-sanctioned inflationism. Conversely, we see huge merit in the stateless, creditless, apolitical opportunities represented by the likes of gold and silver and sensibly priced commodities companies – and we are invested accordingly."
2024-06-11,"Title:Stock Market Built on Seismic Fault
Article:Pay now or pay later. But pay you must...

 WHAT issue can stocks no longer ignore? asks Brian Maher at The Daily Reckoning.
 Ten-year Treasury notes.
 The 10-year Treasury note yielded 3.92% at year's onset.
 Last week the 10-year Treasury note yielded 4.55% – a 63-basis point leap.
 Jim Rickards labels such a bond yield effervescence an ""earthquake"". And the seismometers on Wall Street are reporting tectonic activity. Bloomberg's Jan-Patrick Barnert:
 ""While stocks were mostly ignoring a rise in bond yields since mid-May it seems that...stocks can't ignore the issue any longer.""
 Adds Bloomberg: ""Higher yields are starting to hit stocks.""
 For years the stock market and the economy rose upon a San Andreas Fault of artificially low interest rates.
 Artificially low rates have kept the $100 trillion edifice of public and private debt standing.
 This architectural atrocity stretches thousands of feet into the sky – yet only inches into the earth.
 That is, it has been all high-rise and no foundation. It has been all height and no depth.
 The thing risks a great heaping down as rates shove higher.
 This is the peril of erecting misproportioned structures upon a deeply unstable fault line.
 And vast tectonic energies, vast potential energies, are mounting and mounting.
 Reports Fox Business:
 ""New research published by Baringa, a global consultancy firm, found that companies that refinance between this year and 2030 will pay an additional $381 billion in interest costs due to elevated borrowing rates. This amounts to the largest single increase in debt-related costs and the highest cumulative interest payment total ever faced by US companies.
 ""The largest expense is expected to occur in 2024, with more than $3 trillion in loans and bonds set to mature this year. Companies refinancing that debt will likely pay $76 billion more in interest this year than they did under lower interest rates, according to Baringa, which analyzed FactSet data.""
 In conclusion:
 ""It's tempting to look at plateauing interest rates and conclude that the worst is behind us, but that's simply not true,"" said Cindra Maharaj, partner in Baringa's financial services practice. ""In fact, US businesses and the wider economy are just beginning to experience the painful effects of a serious hangover from the rapid escalation in interest rates that will last for several years to come.""
 The United States government confronts an identical fix.
 The Congressional Budget Office projects 2025 net interest expenses will scale $951 billion.
 From 2025-2034 the same Congressional Budget Office divines annual $1.2 trillion net interest expenses...for a combined $12.4 trillion.
 We add that the Congressional Budget Office forecasts no recession. It further forecasts habitually expanding tax receipts.
 What if recession comes hammering down? What if tax receipts do not expand in the forecast fashion?
 Then net interest expenses will bulge greater yet.
 And the central difficulty multiplies – deeper into the pit goes the government of the United States.
 That is, deeper into the pit go the citizens this preposterous organization purports to serve.
 For they are thrown upon the hook. The burden of payment is thrust upon them.
 As we have argued before: Government lacks all resources.
 Before government can ladle out one meager Dollar for guns, for butter, for bread, for circuses...it must first pluck it up from private pockets – directly or indirectly.
 That is, directly through taxes or indirectly through credit – borrowing.
 That is, through taxes or taxes.
 The borrowed Dollar must be repaid...with interest into the bargain.
 Thus the Dollar borrowed is merely a delayed plucking, a plucking at one remove.
 It is a plucking nonetheless. It represents a future plucking of the taxpayer's pocket.
 It is in one sense a greater plucking owing to the interest. It is he who services the interest. It is he who absorbs the fleecing.
 And we hazard he is in for an extended fleecing. We do not believe elevated rates are a transience.
 Michael Hartnett is Bank of America's chief investment strategist. From whom:
 ""The lower inflation of the last 40 years that sent interest rates down and stock market valuations higher has reached a turning point. We believe we are at a secular turning point for both inflation and interest rates.
 ""We believe 2020 likely marked a secular low point for inflation and interest rates...due to a reversal of deflationary secular factors, fiscal excess and an explosive cyclical reopening of the global economy creating excess demand for goods, services and labor.""
 And if you invest money in the stock market? You confront a vastly extended lean season.
 Market history has witnessed eight major cycles dating to 1871. Investors grabbed the greatest gains – nearly all of them – in four cycles of the eight.
 Investors handed over their gains in the others. The silent thief of inflation pickpocketed them.
 Importantly: The bulking majority of market gains across these cycles were harvested during disinflationary cycles – not inflationary cycles.
 What if Hartnett is correct? What if the 40-year cycle of declining inflation and declining interest rates is ending?
 It would suggest rough going for stocks during the coming years...as the cycle swings from disinflation...to inflation.
 At present valuations, stocks could shed 50% or more of last decade's gains.
 By some estimates, your odds of losing money in the stock market approach 100% – odds that make the bravest fellow quail.
 What if we train our binoculars on the farthest horizon...20 years out?
 Michael Carr instructs technical analysis at New York Institute of Finance. Says he:
 ""Starting from this level, stocks are likely to disappoint over the next 20 years.""
 Twenty years? That is correct:
 ""When the P/E ratio is near all-time highs, as it is now, the S&P 500 delivers annual returns averaging about 5% over the next 20 years. When the P/E ratio is near all-time lows, returns are about three times higher, averaging 15.4% a year over the next 20 years.""
 Yet as we are fond to say: Climate is what you can expect. Weather is what you actually get.
 Even the harshest bear market has its joys, as even the harshest winter has its thaws.
 We expect not a fantastic tempest but a protracted malaise – a long season of dreary drizzle, of false starts and false dawns.
 This time is different, say Wall Street's drummers. It always is.
 Yet if a hangover exists in direct proportion to the binge that produced it...investors may be down for the following decade...or two..."
2024-06-10,"Title:Hyperinflation or Deflation? Or, Rome vs. USA '24
Article:Fiat currency crash bad for wealth and power...

 This CONTRARIAN sees a strong consensus around the notion that hyperinflation is the inevitable end-game of nation-states/central banks issuing fiat currencies, writes Charles Hugh Smith in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Fiat means currencies that are not restrained by being pegged to tangible assets such as gold reserves. So the temptation to issue more currency (via ""printing"" or borrowing new currency into existence by selling sovereign bonds) becomes irresistible to politicians and central bankers alike as the means to mollify every constituency, from elites to the military to commoners dependent on state-funded bread and circuses.
 This unrestrained creation of new money far in excess of the expansion of goods and services (ie, the real economy) devalues the currency, as ""all the new money chases too few goods and services.""
 Gresham's law kicks in – bad money drives good money out of circulation – as precious metals, fine art, gemstones, etc. are hoarded and the depreciating currency is spent as fast as possible before its purchasing power declines even further.
 The Cantillon effect also kicks in: Those closest to the spigot of new money get first dibs on converting the depreciating currency into tangible goods, leaving the non-elites to sweep up the ""trickle-down"" shreds left as the currency loses purchasing power daily.
 The consensus holds that there is no way to stop this decay of purchasing power to near-zero – ie, hyperinflation – once it starts. As in a Greek tragedy, the fatal flaw of the protagonist – in this case, fiat currency – leads inevitably to its destruction.
 In the real world, things having to do with money tend to occur because they benefit powerful interests. This leads us to ask of hyperinflation cui bono, to whose benefit? Exactly which powerful interests benefit when a currency's purchasing power plummets to near-zero?
 The idea here is that there will be pushback if it doesn't benefit the wealthy and powerful. So either hyperinflation somehow benefits the wealthy and powerful, or it escapes their control and wipes them out along with the powerless commoners.
 That raises the question: Didn't the wealthy and powerful see what was coming and couldn't they have reversed the policies generating hyperinflation? If not, why not?
 There are a couple of different threads to follow here. One is that capital is what matters to the wealthy and powerful because they own the vast majority of it while credit is what matters to the poor, as credit is their only way to acquire a bit of capital to invest in their own enterprise/household.
 The poor owe debt, the wealthy own debt: Debt (such as a home mortgage) is an asset to the wealthy, who buy the loan for its income stream, while debt is a liability to the commoners that must be serviced out of their earned income.
 If wages rise in parallel with high rates of inflation, those who owe debt find their burdens lightened as their mortgage payment remains fixed while their income rises with inflation. Imagine how cheering it is when one finds a once-onerous $200,000 mortgage can now be paid off with a month's salary due to hyperinflation.
 On the flip side, the wealthy and powerful who own the debt are less delighted, as the purchasing power of the currency used to pay off the mortgage has diminished, effectively robbing them of most of the value of their original purchase of the mortgage.
 Where the $200,000 they paid for the mortgage could have bought two nice luxury vehicles, the $200,000 they now receive in full payment can barely buy a used clunker.
 This raises an interesting question: Why on Earth would the wealthy and powerful let hyperinflation destroy the value of all their debt-based assets and income streams? Isn't that completely counter to their interests? If so, why would they let that happen?
 At this juncture it's important to draw a distinction between ancient examples of hyperinflation and the present-day economy. In the declining era of the Roman Empire, the government drastically reduced the silver content in the coinage to generate the illusion that everyone was still being paid in full with only a fraction of the silver contained in old coinage.
 This artifice was quickly uncovered, and old coinage disappeared from circulation due to hoarding and inflation caused prices and wages to soar.
 The difference is back then, the poor owned virtually nothing. Today, the poor ""own"" debt service: They owe interest and principal on the vast quantities of debt owned by the wealthy, who will lose out when the values of their debt-based assets crash to near-zero in hyperinflation.
 Hyperinflation is incredibly beneficial to debtors with earned income and incredibly destructive to those who own the debt being wiped out.
 This leads to a second thread: The wealthy shift their wealth overseas as inflation picks up and wait for the hyperinflationary storm to wipe out the value of literally everything in their home economy, at which point they return, foreign cash in hand, to scoop up all the best assets at fire-sale prices.
 This certainly works on small developing-world economies, but it doesn't work in large economies such as the US' with $156 trillion in assets to convert into other nation's currencies and assets.
 In large economies, the wealth of powerful elites is generated by a functioning economy that produces goods and services and maintains a stable currency. Buying a castle and some gold overseas is not a replacement for productive capital that generates income and capital gains.
 Wiping out the value of the nation's currency also destroys its value as a reserve currency and in global trade, two additional disasters the wealthy and powerful would seek to avoid at all costs.
 If we tot up the winners and losers of hyperinflation, the commoners who owe debt win as long as wages rise with inflation, while the wealthy and powerful lose out. Given the vast asymmetry of wealth and power, do you really think this is going to happen?
 What seems more likely because it serves the interests of the wealthy and powerful is interest rates on sovereign bonds soar, enabling the wealthy who sold off all their risk assets such as stocks and commercial real estate to earn a healthy, low-risk return in Treasuries.
 The central bank is ordered to stop ""printing money"" and the government cuts spending across the board, leading to howls of outrage but since the interests of the wealthy and powerful are at stake, too bad, suck it up, kids, everyone takes a cut.
 Risk assets deflate, the purchasing power of the commoners' debt service stabilizes and the ensuing deflation only hurts those who didn't bail out of speculative risk assets at the top and stash the cash in short-term Treasuries.
 Then, when rates max out, the smart money shifts capital into long-term sovereign bonds and waits for the deflation to send risk asset prices to the basement. Then the long-term bonds can be liquidated for cash, and the deflated assets scooped up at fire-sale prices.
 If we ask cui bono, which scenario is more likely: hyperinflation or a deflationary crushing of risk assets and soaring interest rates?
 Yes, a bunch of zombie/marginal borrowers will default, and those holding the debt will be wiped out, but all that is foreseeable and can be remedied by selling when everyone is bullish on real estate and risk assets.
 As for the commoners, deflating prices increase the purchasing power of their wages. Those with little or no debt will benefit from deflation, as their wages will go further and they'll finally be able to afford risk assets once prices return to pre-bubble levels.
 As for interest rates, we all paid 12% mortgages in the early 1980s and life went on because the loans were modest in size compared with today's bloated Everything Bubble.
 Other than China, it doesn't appear that global money supply is going parabolic. And as this chart indicates, inflation is tolerated as long as it's stretched over a century and wages rise along with prices.
 
 When predicting the future, we're best served by following what benefits the wealthy and powerful, as that is the likeliest outcome. Is hyperinflation a ""solution""?
 Not to the wealthy and powerful."
2024-06-07,"Title:Barbarous Gold Is Back
Article:No one wants a gold standard again. But...

 ELITES are extremely hostile to the idea that gold should have any role whatsoever in the monetary system, says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 To them, gold is truly a barbarous relic, as John Maynard Keynes was supposed to have said. You might as well propose bringing back the horse and buggy.
 Except Keynes never said gold was a barbarous relic. What he did say was more interesting. In his 1924 book Monetary Reform, Keynes in fact wrote, ""The gold standard is already a barbarous relic.""
 Keynes was discussing not gold, but the gold standard. There might not seem to be a difference, but there is. In the 1924 context, he was right. The classical gold standard ended in 1914 with the outbreak of WWI. To pay for the war, combatants printed massive amounts of money.
 After the war many wanted to return to the prewar gold standard. In 1925, for example, the British exchequer was Winston Churchill. He wanted to return to the old gold price, ignoring the fact that the wartime money printing demanded a much higher gold price. He in effect overvalued the pound.
 Keynes told Churchill this would be a deflationary disaster. If Britain was to go back on a gold standard, it would have to set the gold price higher. But Churchill ignored his advice.
 The result was massive deflation and depression in Great Britain, years before depression struck the rest of the world.
 The notoriously flawed gold exchange standard that prevailed until 1939 should never have been adopted, and should have been eliminated before WWII did the job. These days, there isn't a central bank in the world that wants to go back to a gold standard (though many are hoarding gold themselves). But that's not the point. The question is whether they will have to.
 I've had conversations with several Federal Reserve Bank presidents. When you ask them point-blank, ""Is there a theoretical limit to the Fed's balance sheet?"" they say no. They say there are policy reasons to make it higher or lower, but that there's no limit to the amount of money you can print.
 That's completely wrong. That's what they say; that's how they think; and that's how they act. But in their heart of hearts, some people at the Fed know it's wrong. Luckily, people can vote with their feet.
 I always tell people who say we're not on the gold standard that, in a way, we are. You can put yourself on a personal gold standard just by buying gold. In other words, if you think that the value of paper money will be in some jeopardy, or confidence in paper money may be lost, one way to protect yourself is by buying gold. And there's nothing stopping you.
 The typical response is, ""What's the point of owning gold? They're just going to confiscate it, like Roosevelt did in 1933."" I find that extremely unlikely.
 In 1933, we'd just come through four years of the Great Depression, and Roosevelt was new in office. People talk about the first hundred days, but he closed the banks right after he was sworn in. And he confiscated gold only a few weeks later.
 And it wasn't as if Eliot Ness was going door to door, breaking into your house and taking gold. They wanted to get a small number of people who had 400-ounce bars in bank vaults. And they got those people because they were able to close the banks and use them as intermediaries to confiscate that gold.
 But now, gold is far more dispersed, and there's far less trust in government. If the government tried to confiscate gold today, there would be various forms of resistance. The government knows this. So they wouldn't issue that order, because they know it couldn't be enforced, and it might cause various kinds of civil disobedience or pushback.
 As long as you can own gold, you can put yourself on your own gold standard by converting paper money to gold. I recommend you do that. I'm not suggesting you convert all your Dollars to gold. Not at all.
 But I do recommend having 10% of your investable assets in gold for the conservative investor, and maybe 20% for the aggressive investor – no more than that. Those are very high allocations relative to what people have. Most people own no gold.
 If demand spiked suddenly, there's not enough gold in the world – at current prices – to satisfy that demand. Gold prices would have to rise dramatically to bring them in line with demand.
 If some scenarios play out, you are going to see the price of gold rocket to the moon. And it may happen in a very short time.
 You shouldn't expect a steady, gradual increase. Gold may to drift along sideways, going nowhere for a period. Then you'll see a spike, then another spike and then a super-spike. It could happen within months.
 At that point, gold becomes a major force. Ultimately I expect gold to reach $15,000 an ounce or more. That figure isn't made up. I didn't come up with it to be provocative. It's a product of the actual math. They're the numbers you get when you simply divide the money supply by the amount of gold in the market. Under some scenarios, gold could even reach $27,000. There are many variables in play.
 When the super-spike happens, you're going to have two Americas. You're going to have one America that was not prepared. Paper savings will be wiped out; 401(k)s will be devalued; pensions, insurance and annuities will be devalued through inflation. That's because it's not just the price of gold going up. It's the Dollar going down. Gold is just an indicator.
 It's like taking the temperature of a patient with a fever and blaming it on the thermometer when it reads 104. The thermometer's not to blame for the fever; it's just telling you what's going on.
 Likewise, the price of gold isn't an economic object or aim in itself; it's a price signal. It tells you what's going on in the economy.
 And gold at the levels I'm talking about would mean that you've now verged into hyperinflation, or something close to it, because nothing happens in isolation.
 Once expectations shift toward inflation, which is happening, it can be dramatic. Though the rate of inflation has reduced since peaking in June 2022, inflation's not going away. People are now beginning to sense that.
 Still, central banks will never voluntarily return to a gold standard. But if gold is such a barbarous relic, if gold has no role in the monetary system, if gold is a ""stupid"" investment, then why are the Russians and Chinese, among others, stockpiling gold hand over fist? Are they stupid?
 Well, I've spoken with many of them and I can assure you they're not stupid. But if there's a run on paper currencies (which is entirely possible) or borderline hyperinflation (also possible), central banks may have to go to a gold standard. Not because they want to, but because they find it necessary to calm the markets.
 I suggest you buy your gold at current levels – around $2360 – and ride the wave up to much higher levels. It'll protect your wealth in the days ahead. Like every market, it will fluctuate. Nothing goes up in a straight line. But you want to focus on the longer-term picture. And it looks very bright for gold.
 So I invite you to go on your own personal gold standard. One day, the rest of the world may join you."

Article:Energy, war and AI bag a few Dollars more from 'Commodities Supercycle'...


              
           


REMEMBER the Commodities Supercycle? 
            asks Adrian Ash in this note sent to BullionVault users in Monday's Weekly Update email.


              
           

             Back in the early 2000s, and thrashing around for a hot new trend to sell to investors as the DotCom Bubble crashed and burned, investment banks and brokerages latched onto raw materials.
           

              
           

             Because, with the internet investing boom plunging from bust to dust, maybe real stuff dug out of the ground was going to take over...
           

              
           

             ...limited in supply in the just the way that computer code and new issues of tech-stock shares were not.
           

              
           

             Well, here we are again. Buy raw materials. The Earth isn't making gold, silver, copper or nickel anymore. Geopolitics and war are pushing demand for those metals higher. And the US Nasdaq 100 index of tech stocks has only been this expensive once before in terms of commodities prices...
           

              
           

             ...back at – GASP! – the very top of the 
            Tech Stock Bubble.
           

              
           




              
           

             Rewind to the early 2000s, and the idea of a Commodities Supercycle took off as the US-UK invasion of Iraq sent crude oil higher, sucking in speculative money fleeing the collapse of the Nasdaq, UK techMARK and Germany's Neuer Markt.
           

              
           

             Commodities then flew as China became the No.1 consumer of everything from crude oil to concrete to copper. And while the Western world's 'global' financial crisis did the heavy lifting in taking gold prices 7 times higher between 2001 and 2011, it was the idea of China covering itself in solar panels which drove silver prices back up to 1980's 
            all-time silver top at $50 per Troy ounce. 
           

              
           

             This time around, Goldman Sachs has (of course) been 
            out of the blocks early in talking up the return of the supercycle, starting in spring last year.
           

              
           

             After all, the US investment bank was 
            home to the marketing team which gave the world 
            the BRICS acronym in 2001...
           

              
           

             ...a promotional gimmick that has since broken out of Powerpoint sales-decks to become 
            a political gimmick with its own annual summit.
           

              
           

             For promoting the Commodity Supercycle Part 2, the 
            mainstream media has now really latched on in 2024, along with 
            major mining companies and even 
            government bean-counters.
           

              
           

             And while gold dominates the headlines in our little corner of the natural resources markets, it is actually 
            silver...the far more useful precious metal industrially...which has shone brightest this spring.
           

              
           

             Since the end of February, in fact, silver has outperformed pretty much every other hot-hot investment trend you can name...
           

              
           

             ...rising almost 40% in Dollar, Sterling and Euro terms in just 13 weeks.
           

              
           




              
           

             Our chart tracks the price of silver and a bunch of other assets. Just for fun, we've priced everything  in terms of the Euro, too.
           

              
           

             Rebased to 1st March, the chart enables us to compare the relative gains across this clutch of go-go investments. And, as you can see, silver blew past gold and Bitcoin...
           

              
           

             ...outperforming green energy, military manufacturing and even artificial intelligence in the 3 months ending last Friday, the end of May.
           

              
           

 Danish windpower giant Ørsted (CPH: ORSTED) gained a nice but unexciting 8% in Euro terms;
 US defence giant Raytheon (NYSE: RTX) leapt by nearly 20%, outpacing its rival Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) three-fold;
 Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) rose 38% as the world went gaga over the 'artificial intelligence' chipmaker's earnings and outlook.


             Why highlight those 3 stocks?
           

              
           

             It's because they are leaders in their fields. And those fields...of energy, military conflict and AI...now dominate today's headlines, outlook and long-term spending plans.
           

              
           

             For policymakers (and I suspect for most other folk too) these boom industries feel like the good, the bad and the ugly of tomorrow arriving uninvited today.
           

              
           

             Switching to green energy is clearly better than choking on the fumes humanity has spewed out since prehistory. Renewable's promise of a sustainable future clearly contrasts with throwing money at wanting or preparing for war, whether in attack or defence. Artificial intelligence meantime remains a Pandora's Box, offering to fix untold problems while 
            delegating ever-more power over our daily lives to a 
            'Computer says no!' dystopia.
           

              
           

             Whether you like them or not, these bandwagons will keep on rolling, and silver is vital to each of them. On top of 
            silver's key role in solar power, mostly that's because any object you can name with an on/off switch is certain to contain a little or more of 
            the 'indispensable' metal.
           

              
           

             Copper also figures very heavily in today's 3 boom industries of green energy, defence and AI, needed for wiring together all those silver-based solar panels and electrical switches. The base metal stole the financial-news headlines in April and early May as it shot up to new all-time record highs, driven by chatter and forecasts of relentless shortages ahead.
           

              
           

             ""Existing mines and projects under construction,"" 
            gasps CNBC, ""will meet only 80% of copper needs by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.""
           

              
           

             ""Six new large mines need to come online every year by 2050 to meet global copper demand,"" adds 
            a mining mechanic, ""but the problem is it takes about 20 years between discovering a new copper mineral deposit and getting a permit to build a mine. None of this takes into consideration the upgrades to the electrical infrastructure needed to 'electrify' the world by 2050.""
           

              
           

             So in short, he concludes, ""electrifying the world by 2050 is a politician's pipe dream that will never happen.""
           

              
           

             Hence the recent surge in copper prices, driven by talk of structural and unfixable market deficits between supply and demand in the decades ahead.
           

              
           

             Short term, however, the apparent shortage of copper supplies suddenly seems to have got fixed last week. Chinese warehouse stockpiles of copper...sometimes known as the metal 'with a PhD in economics' thanks to its use across construction and industry worldwide...rose to 322,000 tonnes according to data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange. That's 
            almost 3 times the average May level of the past 5 years...
           

              
           

             Maybe those new record-high prices lent a hand in fixing the 'shortage' of supply?
           

              
           

             Similarly for silver, ""Ample above-ground stocks remain the key challenge to prices,"" said specialist consultancy Metals Focus when its 
            latest supply-and-demand data was launched with April's publication of the 
            World Silver Survey 2024 from the mining industry-backed Silver Institute in Washington.
           

              
           

             Yes, silver’s supply/demand conditions ""are expected to enjoy another strong year in 2024,"" Metals Focus says, thanks to ""robust gains from [solar] applications and a decent
           

             performance in other segments [taking] industrial demand to a new all-time record.
           

              
           

             But even as silver's market deficit widens 17% year-on-year on Metals Focus' estimate, reaching the second highest on their data series, stockpiles of silver bullion in London and exchange-registered vaults (mostly in the US and China) amounted to nearly 15 months of global supply at the end of 2023, ""and there are bullion inventories also held elsewhere.
           

              
           

             ""This is likely to prevent a physical squeeze from emerging in the short-term"" even as new mine output lags demand by a near-record level.
           

              
           

             As for crude oil, the Opec+ cartel of producer nations, ""under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, has tried to push global oil prices 
            towards $100 a barrel,"" says long-time energy correspondent Javier Blas at Bloomberg.
           

              
           

             ""Now it appears it's reversing course,"" giving up its quest for the return of $100 oil as global demand falters but supplies do not in the face of that 'impossible' electrification.
           

              
           

             Simply put, this new Commodities Supercycle – if it turns out to deserve the name – is very different from the early 2000s' version.
           

              
           

             Crude oil won't figure. Nor can China shoulder the bulk of new demand. Its economic growth is very much lower today than 2 decades ago, not least because two-decades-and-more of massive infrastructure, real estate and factory building are now behind it, leaving a threat of over-capacity, saturation and falling prices.
           

              
           

             But what coal was to the first industrial revolution and oil was to the 20th Century, silver and copper are to today's big boom industries of green technology, artificial intelligence and defence. And driven by these long-term prospects, 
            short-term speculation in silver has skyrocketed.
           

              
           

             Why else do you think the price of silver jumped 40% in just 13 weeks?
           

              
           




              
           

             As the green line shows, bullish betting on Comex silver futures and options has jumped to the highest levels in 2 years this spring, surging at the fastest 3-month pace since mid-2019.
           

              
           

             Trading volumes in Shanghai silver futures meanwhile leapt tenfold in mid-May from the same period in February...
           

              
           

             ...helping push prices on the Shanghai Gold Exchange to a record premium over London quotes of almost $4 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             Longer term, of course, demand and supply for silver itself will be what matters. But tick-by-tick, the supply and demand for leveraged betting credit usually counts far more.
           

              
           

             Put another way...and with sentiment fuelled by the latest news and views around the good, the bad and the ugly of our 21st Century boom industries...""Institutional investment will remain the dominant price driver,"" 
            says Metals Focus.
           

              
           

             That's why they expect ""any price weakness to be short-lived, given that the Fed is still expected to start monetary loosening later this year, albeit at a slower pace than previous expected.
           

              
           

             ""We expect precious metals investor interest will be healthy in the second half of the year, which will ultimately be positive for the silver price.""
           

              
           

             So will silver's deep market deficits. But more because of investor sentiment towards that fact than via any immediate tightening of supply for industrial users."
2024-06-06,"Title:Swap Meme Stocks for Solar
Article:Roaring Kitty can keep GME...

 ALL HELL broke loose on the New York Stock Exchange early Monday morning as traders slammed shares of Berkshire Hathaway, opting instead to gobble up GameStop calls as meme madness returned to the markets with a vengeance, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Okay, that story's not exactly true.
 But you have to admit this would be one of the most hilarious (and irrational) market narratives of all time. Imagine investors cratering Uncle Warren's Berkshire Hathaway by more than 99% to follow a massive GameStop squeeze. Insanity!
 In reality, a glitch at the NYSE early Monday morning incorrectly showed Berkshire Hathaway and a few other high-profile stocks almost completely wiped out, which just so happened to occur right as shares of GameStop were halted for volatility following a Sunday night stunt courtesy of none other than Roaring Kitty – the GameStop trader who sparked the first meme stock rallies way back in 2020-2021.
 This time around, Roaring Kitty posted a screenshot of his GameStop portfolio reportedly worth more than $100 million. Of course, it's impossible to say whether the screenshot shows his actual holdings. But that didn't stop the meme stock crew from pouncing on shares late Sunday night using Robinhood's 24-hour trading feature.
 By Monday morning's premarket session, the stock had nearly doubled. But the momentum failed to carry beyond the first couple minutes of trade. GME opened above $40 and immediately started to sink. By midday, it was up ""only"" 30% – well off its early morning highs. It closed the trading day up only 21%.
 These fast gains are impressive when viewed out of context. But if we dig a little deeper, we see a chart that's turning into a complete mess. Not only is GME exhausted following the Sunday night pump, but it's also reversed well below those mid-May highs that briefly shot the stock toward $65.
 It's beginning to look as if this echo bubble is already running out of juice. Less than a month ago, Roaring Kitty was able to send GME rocketing nearly 175% in just two trading days by posting a couple of memes on his Twitter/X account.
 Now, he's starting to look like the boy who cried wolf as GME shares fail to build on their weekend momentum. Don't worry – he'll book his profits (another screenshot posted Monday evening claims he's still ""all in"").
 So, what about the folks who blindly followed his lead? I don't think they'll be too happy as they hang on for dear life this week.
 The trouble with these emotional trades is that we all remember the huge move that catapulted GME to outrageous heights during the first meme stock days of early 2021. Fast forward more than three years, and you'll find desperate traders would do anything to get another shot at those epic squeezes. But lightning rarely strikes twice. Instead, we'll have to settle for these little echo booms and busts.
 In fact, some of the other big tech rallies look like they could use a break as the calendar flips to June.
 A few semiconductors not named NVDA are starting to get wobbly. We also had the Salesforce Inc. (CRM) earnings debacle that ripped through the entire industry on Friday and caused some serious intraday volatility in tech. All the cloud computing stocks took a hit, along with semis and mega-caps. And don't even get me started on some of these stalled-out growth names. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) rolled over in early April and never recovered. It's now down 17% year-to-date.
 Bottom line: With the hot summer vacation days quickly approaching and so many overextended stocks starting to settle down, it doesn't feel like a great time to rally the retail trading troops behind a short squeeze.
 Instead of playing meme-stock roulette, I'm more inclined to dig for fresh breakouts among the stocks and sectors that are flying under the radar right now.
 A funny thing happens when a down-and-out stock starts to break out. First, no one believes it. They assume the move is nothing but a dead cat bounce. The news hasn't flipped yet, and everything you hear about the company/sector will be indifferent or bearish.
 But as the breakouts expand, you'll begin to hear some bullish whispers.
 If the good vibes spread to the entire sector, those whispers will begin to attract more attention.
 That's exactly what's starting to happen with solar stocks.
 No one wanted anything to do with the solar names during the first quarter. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) was nearly chopped in half in 2023, and most of the most visible companies in the sector were limping into the new year at or near multi-year lows. Some of these stocks were still catching analyst downgrades as recently as January.
 At the time, the reasons to avoid these stocks made total sense: prices were up, installations were down, and high interest rates were crushing demand.
 But that was before First Solar Inc. (FLSR) broke out. FSLR suddenly launched higher in mid-May, jumping above $200 for the first time in nine months and sparking a rally that would push shares up 40% in just two weeks.
 All of a sudden, a stock no one wanted to own was quickly becoming one of the top momentum movers on the market...
 
 You can probably guess what happened next.
 The solar story quickly began to change. First, there was chatter about how Biden's proposed China tariffs would offer a boost to the sector. Then, analysts began touting solar as an important piece of the artificial intelligence energy puzzle.
 In fact, UBS just highlighted FSLR as ""an overlooked, direct beneficiary of increasing AI-driven electricity demand.""
 Now, we're seeing other stocks in and around the sector beginning to firm up. And FLSR hasn't given back a penny of its initial breakout, either. The stock continues to consolidate right at the top of its range, which just so happens to be in the neighborhood of its all-time highs from early 2008.
 Turning to the ETF, we can see TAN has been building a base for almost a year. It's now in the early stages of breaking out. And if FSLR is any indication, we'll see new 52-week highs from TAN soon enough (we own calls over at The Trading Desk, by the way).
 It's still early in this solar narrative flip. If these stocks can power through the summer chop, we could be looking at a new leading momentum sector heading into the third quarter. Forget about the fizzling meme stocks – and don't sleep on solar!"
2024-06-05,"Title:Yield Curve Inversion: It's the Steepener That Hurts
Article:Still inverted, the yield curve is in countdown mode...

 MY DAUGHTER, who is taking an increasing interest in the economy now that she's out of school, working and trying to fund her artistic endeavors, mentioned an article she read about the economy, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 The article stated that despite an inverted yield curve, the economy is improbably holding up.
 At this point dad, the guy who never misses an opportunity to bore people to death with economy/market talk in real life, sprang into lecture mode.
 Sensing her interest, I went further and marked up this graph from the St. Louis Fed and texted it to her while we were talking. I explained what I have bludgeoned you about when I see too much 'inverted yield curve means recession coming!' b/s in the media.
 It's not the inversion, it's the subsequent steepening that runs with an economy decelerating into recession. This graph proves it absolutely, at least when taking a quant of history.
 The shaded areas are recessions, dutifully following inversions but corresponding with steepeners.
 
 Our theme for the last many months (after it hit me over the head that, duh, it's a terribly divisive election year) has been that the administration in power will do what it can to stay in power.
 That includes funding of pet projects in the green energy space, the Semi Chips Act, rigging the GSEs with false (non-market driven) interest rates, heretofore robust government hiring (April being the first muted reading in many months of our tracking) and whatever else they can employ to keep up economic appearances.
 The extended inversion shown above holds well to that script. It remains inverted, which is the product of a Goldilocks flattener. The timing could well be that this extended inversion will persist through the election.
 As I told my daughter, it (a steepener) is coming but there is no time limit on how long an inversion can persist. That is why it is not good to listen to media eyeball and eardrum harvesting when it blares about ""inversion!""
 Those blow horns first began sounding back in 2022. But it's coming."
2024-06-04,"Title:Western Gold Investing Sentiment Hits 11-Month High
Article:Gold and silver bullion investment holdings hit fresh record value...


              
           


GOLD INVESTING sentiment among Western economies rose again in May, reaching its strongest in 11 months on world-leading marketplace BullionVault as the precious metal extended its run of new record prices in US Dollar terms, 
            writes Adrian Ash, director of research.


              
           

             Profit-taking on existing gold bullion investments eased back for the second month running. The number of new users choosing to buy precious metals for the first time was more than 50% above its prior 12-month average.
           

              
           

             So having seized the gains offered by central banks and Chinese investors driving bullion prices up to new record highs, 
            Western profit-taking in gold looks to be nearing exhaustion.
           

              
           

             New interest in buying physical gold – securely vaulted, insured and ready for instant sale in the form of large, low-cost 
            gold bullion bars – has meanwhile rebounded as 2024's packed election schedule adds domestic uncertainty to global tensions and conflict.
           

              
           




              
           

             May 2024 saw bullion investing prices flatline at April's new record gold highs in UK Pound and Euro terms, holding at £1862 and €2175 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             But priced in the US Dollar, the 'safe haven' precious metal rose 1.7% to set its 3rd new month-average high in a row at $2352.
           

              
           

             In response, the number of net buyers across the month on BullionVault – now caring for a record $4.6 billion (£3.6bn, €4.2bn, ¥729bn) of gold, silver, platinum and palladium, and finding 9-in-10 of its 100,000 clients in Western Europe and North America – slipped by 8.1% from April's 10-month high.
           

              
           

             The number of people choosing to sell gold in contrast more than halved, down by 51.5% to the fewest since August last year. Together that pushed the 
            Gold Investor Index – our unique measure of revealed preference on the world's largest private-investor marketplace for physical precious metals – higher by 2.8 points from April to 54.4.
           

              
           

             The highest reading since June last year, that was 6.9 points above 
            March's record low Gold Investor Index of 47.5. Any reading above 50.0 signals more net buyers than net sellers across the month. The Gold Investor Index set a decade-high of 65.9 as the Covid Crisis took hold in March 2020.
           

              
           

             Last time our 
            Investor Index for gold was this high, gold prices were $430 cheaper per ounce (or £350 lower for UK Pound gold prices, and €415 cheaper in Euros).
           

              
           

             So while this spring's run of new record prices may be running out of steam, gold's unique appeal as a financial and geopolitical hedge is now meeting a resurgence in Western investment.
           

              
           

             As a group, investors used BullionVault to sell just 134 kilograms more gold than they chose to buy as a group in May, liquidating less than half the quantity sold in April and trimming their aggregate holdings by 0.3%, the smallest net outflow since January.
           

              
           

             That took the total quantity of gold now held in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or (most popular) Zurich down to 45.1 tonnes, the lowest end-month weight since September 2020. But those securely stored and insured holdings still set a fresh month-end Dollar and Japanese Yen record by value above $3.4 billion and ¥534bn, and held almost unchanged near April's Sterling and Euro records at £2.6bn and €3.1bn.
           

              
           

             The number of first-time bullion investors meanwhile slipped in May by 17.3% from 
            April's 13-month high for new precious metals interest. But it was 51.3% greater than the 12-month average, led by a steep rise in the number of new BullionVault users living in the USA, France and Spain.
           

              
           




              
           

             As you can see, the Silver Investor Index also rallied further in May from March's new all-time low.
           

              
           

             But unlike our measure of gold investing sentiment, it continued to signal more sellers than buyers across the month with a reading of 48.0 – only 0.7 points higher from April and 3.0 points above the month before – as the more industrially-useful precious metal set its highest month-average price in over 11 years in US Dollar terms at $29.40 per Troy ounce and neared 13-year highs in UK Pounds and Euros at £23.28 and €27.20.
           

              
           

             More like gold, silver selling by BullionVault users outran demand by the smallest margin since January, albeit with a further 1.1% outflow of almost 13 tonnes. And while that took total silver holdings down to a 40-month low by weight beneath 1,155 tonnes, the value rose to a new record, topping $1.1 billion, £900 million, €1bn and ¥181bn for the first time.
           

              
           

             Last time 
            the price of silver was as high in US Dollars as it was this May, back in February 2013 – eve of the post-financial crisis crash in gold and silver prices, their steepest drops since the start of the 1980s – BullionVault's Investor Index for the more industrially useful precious read 58.1, over 10 points higher from last month's reading.
           

              
           

             But far from a rush for the exits, the gold and silver selling by Western investors in the first half of 2024 has signalled profit-taking and rebalancing. What's more, this spring's turnaround in precious metals investment sentiment is coming off a very low base.
           

              
           

             It could give a big impetus to new price gains as this year's geopolitics and uncertainties unfold, helping strengthen the floor beneath bullion market prices as the much-delayed start to Western central banks cutting interest rates on cash finally arrives."

Article:Fixing this gets harder as the problems roll on...

 In the LAST twenty years, Japan's government could have sallied forth and fixed a lot of the problems that have been accumulating over the years, writes Nathan Lewis in this update on Japan penned in 2023 and published on his New World Economics blog.
 Mostly, this has been intensifying welfare/social security/healthcare burdens, on a weakening economic base. Despite the tendency of governments to adopt an ""austerity"" response here, which mostly means Higher Taxes, the solution is rather, tax reform which results in lower tax rates, although the revenue/GDP ratio may remain unchanged.
 But a much healthier economy would lead to rising GDP, and thus more tax revenue.
 On the spending side, the main problem, just as in the US and most other developed countries, is legacy social programs, including needs-based welfare, public pensions (Social Security) and healthcare systems that are much too expensive and burdensome.
 A much better solution has been found by governments such as Singapore, which relies primarily upon Provident Fund systems. These are basically private accounts with mandatory contributions, similar to Payroll Taxes but you get the money in an account owned by you. Singapore has no Public Pension (Social Security) system, but relies on a Provident Fund system that amounts to a mandatory 401(k)-type program.
 Over a lifetime, even people of modest income can amass quite a lot of assets. There are still needs-based welfare systems for seniors who find that these private accounts prove insufficient. But, the number of such people is small.
 Also, because there aren't a lot of spending programs, taxes are low (Singapore's revenue/GDP ratio is about 14%), which means a strong economy, which means that wages are higher and it is easier to accumulate assets, such as home ownership. Thus, people are wealthier, in general, upon retirement, or even can continue working at a higher wage if they prefer.
 Also, as people die, they leave more assets to their children, including any Provident Fund retirement assets that they did not use. These inheritors are themselves often close to retirement, so they enjoy a quick bump-up in retirement assets from their parents.
 Although Japan's healthcare system is, I would say, not bad (compared to the disaster in the US), nevertheless Singapore's market-based system is much better – accomplishing better outcomes at about half the price. This too has a Provident Fund system, or what amounts to Health Savings accounts with mandatory contributions.
 Singapore has the same pattern of aging population and low fertility as Japan, but none of the fiscal problems. Its systems are much better suited for our time.
 Japan's government could have spent the last two decades adopting a model something like this, but of course they instead played smoke-and-mirrors with government financing, while allowing all other problems to fester and worsen. This is very dumb; but, alas, also very common."
2024-05-23,"Title:AI's Wild West Gets a Slow-Moving Sheriff
Article:US law is about to bang the bubble...

 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is like the powerful character in an action movie who looks invincible until they turn around, revealing a fatal spear embedded in their back, writes Charles Hugh Smith, author of OfTwoMinds, in this piece published by Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 The spear in AI's back is the American legal system, which has been issuing free passes to tech companies and platforms for decades on the idea that limiting innovation will hurt economic growth, so we'd best let tech companies run with few restrictions.
 The issuance of free passes to tech monopolies/cartels and platforms may be ending. Letting Big Tech run with few restrictions has led to the smothering of innovation as tech monopolies do what every monopoly excels at, which is buy up potential competitors, suppress competition, pursue regulatory capture via lobbying and spend freely on deceptive PR.
 Now antitrust regulators are finally looking at the uncompetitive wastelands created by Big Tech and recognizing the union-busting tactics of quasi-monopolies like Starbucks and Amazon. The bloom might be off the Big Tech/monopoly rose.
 Enter AI, which offers the thrilling prospect of trillions of Dollars in additional profits for purveyors of AI and all those companies that use their AI tools.
 The American legal system deals with new technologies much as a reptile digests a meal – slowly. I get email from readers about defending the Constitution, something we all support.
 I'm not an attorney, but my impression of constitutional law is that it is a tediously complex thicket of case law that must be carefully picked through before we can even begin to understand exactly what we're defending: Every issue anyone might be concerned about has already accumulated an immense load of rulings and arguments.
 This is American jurisprudence: Advocacy goes to trial and rulings are issued, some as rulings that will pertain to all future cases and some that will not. The law advances in new fields such as AI as positions are argued before judges/juries and then reviewed by higher courts as losers appeal judgments/rulings.
 A great many things we might think are novel have long been settled. Isn't the Selective Service Act a form of involuntary servitude? Nope, that's been settled long ago. The government's right to draft you to fight in a war of choice is unquestionably the law of the land.
 AI has certain novel features that have yet to be decided by the processes of advocacy, rulings and appeals. In general, corporations selling/giving away AI tools are claiming these tools incur no liability to the issuers of the tools because they're akin to software that, for example, adds HTML coding to plain text: a tool that performs a process.
 This strikes me as incomplete. It seems to me that AI, by its very name and nature, is making implicit claims of utility far beyond mere processing of data or text: AI is called AI because it is adding intellectual value to data or text.
 All the disclaimers in the world cannot dissolve this implicit claim of utility that adds value. Since I'm not an attorney, I'm not able to put this in proper legal terms; I'm using the terminology of philosophy.
 But the law is a system based on philosophic principles, and so the language of philosophy plays a key role in broadly applicable legal rulings.
 Is all this too abstract? Then let's consider a real-world example. A patient receives a misdiagnosis and suffers as a direct result of the misdiagnosis. In our system of law, somebody or some entity is liable for the consequences of the error, and must pay restitution to those harmed by the error.
 As fact-finding proceeds, it turns out an AI tool was used in the initial scanning of the patient's data. The company that created the AI tool will naturally claim that the tool was intended only to be used under the supervision of a human professional, and there were no claims made as to the accuracy of the AI tool's output.
 This is a specious argument, as the clear intent of the AI tool is to replace human expertise as a means of lowering the costs of diagnosis by accelerating the process and increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis.
 Clearly, the tool was designed for exactly this purpose, and therefore deficiencies in its performance that contributed to the misdiagnosis – for example, the fact that the AI tool rated the diagnostic result with a high probability of accuracy – are the responsibility of the company that issued the AI tool.
 Should the court find the AI company 1% liable for the misdiagnosis, the principle of joint and several liability means the monetary settlement falls on whichever parties can pay the settlement.
 Should the other parties found liable be unable to pay a $10 million settlement, then the AI company might end up paying $9 million of the $10 million settlement, despite their apparently limited liability.
 Off the top of my head, I can foresee dozens of similar examples in which an AI tool can be found partially liable for misrepresentations, errors of omission, unauthorized use of confidential intellectual property and so on, in what can easily become an endless profusion of liability claims.
 If the bloom is off the rose of Big Tech, the likelihood of a court assigning liability to those issuing AI tools increases proportionately. If the ruling is upheld by an appeals court, it will generally enter case law and become the basis for similar lawsuits assigning liability to those entities issuing AI tools.
 That real harm will result from the use of AI tools is a given. The idea that those issuing these tools should be given a free pass because ""we really didn't mean that you could use the tools to reduce human labor and increase accuracy"" does not pass the sniff test, nor will it negate advocacy claiming that these tools implicitly make claims about utility that incur liability.
 Use an AI tool, get sued. The Wild West of AI's claims of zero liability will soon enter the meat grinder of jurisprudence, and implicit claims of utility will be more than enough to incur liability in a court of law – as they should.
 The legal spear in AI's back could prove fatal. A 1% error rate and 1% liability will add up fast."
2024-05-21,"Title:Trump's Dollar Plan: Currency Peace, Not War
Article:Think Plaza and Louvre, not the 1970s...

 THERE has been a lot reported in recent days about the return of currency wars, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 This story arises in the context of a likely Trump election victory in the November Presidential elections.
 Trump badly bungled his transition after first being elected President in 2016. He wasn't ready with a long list of loyal appointees.
 Many of his senior appointments such as Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, James Mattis as secretary of defense and John Kelly as chief of staff secretly disliked Trump but accepted their roles as so-called ""adult supervision"" around the supposedly reckless Trump.
 They thwarted his agenda. That backstabbing came on top of the large number of Obama holdovers in the deep state who saw themselves as a ""resistance"" movement.
 Trump is doing a better job of preparing for a second term as President, but the resistance isn't sitting still either. They're moving to disable a new Trump administration even before the election.
 The currency wars stories are part of that effort.
 As reported by The Washington Post, Politico, The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo Finance and other outlets, Trump's working on a secret plan to devalue the US Dollar. The goal would be to cheapen US exports and thereby help the US balance of trade and create exported-related jobs.
 But the critics say this will only increase US inflation as Americans have to pay more for their imported goods using cheaper Dollars. The critics also say that other countries will retaliate against the US by cheapening their own currencies (that's the essence of a currency war) and no country will be any further ahead.
 In fact, the entire world will be worse off.
 Before looking more closely at what's actually going on, some basics about a currency war should be explained. The first rule is that the world is not always in a currency war.
 The periods from 1944-1971 (the original Bretton Woods era) and 1987-2010 (the period of the Washington Consensus) were times of currency peace. This contrasts with 1921-1936 (Currency War I), 1967-1987 (Currency War II) and the current period since 2010 (Currency War III).
 The second rule is that currency wars can last for 15 years or longer. It comes as no surprise that the currency war that commenced in 2010 is still going strong 14 years later in 2024. And that points to another key aspect of this debate.
 The currency war being written about today by the media is not a new currency war. It's the same one that has been going on since 2010. We're simply in a new phase or a new battle.
 It is true that cheapening your currency can import inflation. Sometimes that's a legitimate policy goal if your country has been suffering from excessive deflation (gradual, moderate consumer price deflation caused by greater market efficiency and competition is economically beneficial).
 That's obviously not the case in the US today.
 It's also true that cheapening your currency can export deflation as trading partners pay less for your goods. That's what China was doing to the entire world from 1994-2010 and that's why the US launched a currency war in 2010 – to fight back against disinflation and borderline deflation caused by cheap Chinese goods.
 Currency wars can also shift jobs overseas and destroy domestic manufacturing as the terms of trade shift based on changing currency values. Retaliation is always waiting right around the corner in any currency war. The US Dollar hit an all-time low in August 2011, which was consistent with the US goal of trying to import inflation.
 But Europe struck back, and the EUR/USD cross-rate crashed from $1.60 to $1.04 as a result. So it is correct that no one wins a currency war, and everyone is damaged in the process due to volatility, uncertainty and the costs of conducting the war.
 So are the critics right that Trump has a secret plan to devalue the Dollar? And are they right that this new stage in the currency war will bring inflation and hurt the US economy?
 The critics are wrong and don't understand what Trump's actually trying to do. Trump isn't trying to start a currency war; he's trying to end it once and for all.
 In the first place, no President has the power to unilaterally devalue the Dollar. That might have been possible under the gold standard or some standard of fixed exchange rates, but that hasn't been the state of the world since 1973.
 Exchange rates fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates, industrial growth, exchange controls, central bank interventions, capital flows, tax rates and many other macroeconomic variables. But the idea that the President can just wave his hand and devalue the Dollar is false.
 Far from the reckless, inflationary process the media claim, Trump's actual plan is based on the highly successful model developed by James Baker for Ronald Reagan and implemented in the Plaza Accord of 1985 and the Louvre Accord of 1987.
 After the severe economic recession of 1982 and Paul Volcker's policy of moving interest rates to 20%, inflation in the US was finally reigned in. Inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 6.1% in 1982 and then 3.2% in 1983.
 Investment in the US went on a tear. US real growth was 16% from 1983-1986. Everyone wanted Dollars to invest in the US and the Dollar boomed reaching an all-time high in 1985.
 Finally, the Reagan administration decided the US Dollar was too strong and was hurting US exports and jobs. Treasury Secretary James Baker convened a meeting of the finance ministers of France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
 The purpose was not to fight a currency war. The purpose was to create order in currency markets out of the chaos that had prevailed since 1973.
 The parties reached a joint agreement that would devalue the US Dollar in an orderly fashion versus the French Franc, Japanese Yen, UK Pound and the German Deutsche Mark.
 Once the targeted level for the Dollar was achieved, the parties would use their best efforts including market intervention as needed to maintain those levels within narrow bands.
 A separate meeting in Paris at the Louvre in 1987 agreed that the devaluation phase was over and the Dollar would be maintained at the new parities. This was not currency war; it was currency peace achieved by agreement and implemented in a cooperative fashion.
 The Louvre Accord (this time including the US, the UK, France, Germany, Japan and Canada) ushered in a period of global prosperity that lasted 20 years until the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.
 Trump's goal is to repeat the success of the Plaza and Louvre accords. Trump's adviser on this is Robert Lighthizer, who is one of the most brilliant financial minds around and was Trump's US trade representative (2017-2021).
 Lighthizer was also USTR for Ronald Reagan from 1983-1985 so he's a veteran of prior currency wars and was in the administration around the time the Plaza Accord was being developed. Lighthizer is the perfect individual to help Trump achieve the kind of success that Reagan and Baker had in the 1980s.
 The media are trying to portray Trump as reckless when he's proposing something highly beneficial for US jobs and US industry. Don't be fooled by false claims of new currency wars.
 Trump's plan could actually achieve a new era of currency stability and lasting prosperity."
2024-05-20,"Title:Platinum Autocat Demand 'Higher for Longer' on EV Slowdown
Article:Hydrogen fuel-cell demand in focus, but auto industry 'sceptical'... 


              
           


A GLOBAL SLOWDOWN in sales of battery-electric vehicles means auto-industry demand for platinum and palladium is holding firm, experts agreed at this May's Platinum Week in London, but opinion remains split over the potential for hydrogen fuel-cell technology.
           

              
           

             Besides investment, jewellery and 
            industrial use of platinum, the metal currently finds 2/5ths of its end-user demand each year from autocatalysts to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion engines. That demand has held firm despite 
            the 'diesel scandal' of 2015 hitting sales of diesel-fuel passenger vehicles, due to tighter emissions standards – needing higher loadings of metal on each autocat – plus substitution for platinum of sister-metal palladium in gasoline systems thanks to the dramatic surge in 
            palladium prices which followed the diesel scandal, accelerating on No.1 producer nation Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 
           

              
           




              
           

             Looking ahead – and with governments worldwide setting deadlines between 2040 and 2050 for the end of new internal combustion engine (ICE) sales – ""Future PGM demand growth will be galvanised by environmental and hydrogen applications,"" says the 
            new 2024 supply-and-demand report from refining and tech specialists Johnson Matthey (LON:JMAT).
           

              
           

             Stronger demand for platinum group metals (PGM) relies on the supply-side of the industry finding and developing new technology uses – a problem not faced by producers of base metals such as copper, nor in gold or silver – agrees Richard Andrew Stewart, chief regional officer Southern Africa for US-listed miner Sibanye Stillwater (JSE:SSW).
           

              
           

             But for now, the No.1 question among attendees at Platinum Week 2024 in London was about the growth in battery-electric penetration of the vehicles market, he said.
           

              
           

             ""We will have failed if it's the still the No.1 question in 2025."" 
           

              
           

             As it is, battery-electric sales have slowed ""near zero growth"" compared to the past decade's relentless expansion in each of the world's 3 major auto markets, said Al Bedwell, director of global powertrain analysis at industrial trends consultancy GlobalData (LON:DATA), also speaking Tuesday afternoon to members of the London Platinum & Palladium Market at the trade association's annual seminar.
           

              
           

             China's EV sales are heading for only 11% growth in 2024 on 
            GlobalData's outlook, Bedwell said, while the USA continues to suffer from ""patchy"" charging infrastructure, and Europe is being hit by Germany's ""abrupt removal"" of government subsidies for new purchases.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""Is the move to electric cars 
            running out of power?"" asks UK broadcaster the BBC, pointing to a drop in sales by US-listed manufacturer Tesla (Nasdaq:TLSA) and a slowdown in EV sales at Chinese giant BYD.
           

              
           

             ""We need to buy a lot more EVs to hit climate targets,"" the BBC goes on, citing the International Energy Agency's call for the number of electric vehicles on the world's roads to rise 10-fold over the next decade.
           

              
           

             The global slowdown in EV sales growth means ""automotive demand [for platinum] is underpinned by a higher-for-longer [internal combustion engine] theme,"" says 
            the latest quarterly report from the mining industry's World Platinum Investment Council, ""with 2024 projected to be the strongest year for automotive demand for platinum"" – needed for autocatalysts to reduce harmful emissions from diesel engines, and increasingly finding substitution to replace palladium in gasoline engine autocats – ""since 2017.""
           

              
           

             On top of that, WPIC's latest quarterly report this week followed the move by analysts SFA Oxford – reporting for German refining group Heraeus – to strip out hydrogen-energy demand as a separate line from the wider 'Other Industrial' category in its data tables and forecasts.
           

              
           

             Total industrial demand is forecast to drop 15% by weight in 2024 on WPIC's forecasts – which use data from specialist analysts 
            Metals Focus – setting the lowest annual total since the Covid crash of 2020, thanks to last year's capacity expansions in the chemical and glass industries not being repeated in 2024.
           

              
           

             Against those 33% and 25% drops respectively, the projected 128% jump in demand from the hydrogen industry (excluding fuel-cell vehicles) is dramatic. But even on top of 2023's 114% rise, this year's total demand from the hydrogen-energy sector is forecast to offset less than 1/5th of the 2024 drop among all other industrial sectors. 
           

              
           

             Bedwell at GlobalData remains ""sceptical"" about the future for fuel cell passenger vehicles, telling LPPM seminar attendees on Tuesday that the very low volume of production will likely see just 12,000 FCEVs made worldwide in 2024. PGM refining and tech specialists Johnson Matthey (LON:JMAT) forecast a 50% rise to 15,000 of light-duty hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles for 2024, remaining ""minimal"" due to the ""lack of subsidy support and a persistent shortage of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure [which] appears to have choked production and sales.""
           

              
           

SFA Oxford see this year's total platinum demand from the hydrogen sector ""stuttering"" and rising by only 1/8th from 2023 – when the sector's demand more than doubled on SFA's data – to reach less than 2.8 tonnes in total.
           

              
           

             Metals Focus' own forecasts in its PGM Focus put total 2024 hydrogen demand around 3.7 tonnes. That compares with total mine supply of 170 tonnes and a further 51 tonnes coming from recycling.
           

              
           

             ""Total supply is continuing a multi-year downward trend,"" says WPIC of the Metals Focus numbers, ""with 2024 expected to be the weakest year in our time series from 2013.""
           

              
           

             Metals Focus forecasts another 
            ""deep"" deficit of physical platinum supply against demand in 2024, albeit smaller than 2023's series record deficit. But with large stockpiles helping ""offset the impact of this shortfall"" they predict the platinum price will remain flat year-on-year.
           

              
           

             Half of platinum-group metals mining outside of Russia is now making a loss at current prices, Sibanye's Stewart said. But lower output alone won't boost prices he believes, because the PGM market is driven instead by technology use, related legislation, and the economic cycle.
           

              
           

             With gold prices hitting new all-time highs today as silver reaches 2012 levels in US Dollar terms, platinum is currently trading at half its 2008 peak, albeit reaching 12-month highs above $1000 per Troy ounce during Platinum Week. Palladium has meantime fallen by 2/3rds from its New Year 2022 records."
2024-05-18,"Title:Call That a Gold Forecast? Try THIS
Article:First, assume a gold standard. Next...

 I HAVE previously said that gold could reach $15,000 by 2026, says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Today, I'm updating that forecast. Gold may actually exceed $27,000.
 I don't say that to get attention or to shock people. It's not a guess; it's the result of rigorous analysis.
 Of course, there's no guarantee it'll happen. But this forecast is based on the best available tools and models that have proved accurate in many other contexts.
 Here's how I reached that price level forecast.
 This analysis begins with a simple question: What's the implied non-deflationary price of gold under a new gold standard?
 No central banker in the world wants a gold standard. Why would they? Right now, they control the machinery of global currencies (also called fiat money).
 They have no interest in a form of money they can't control. It took about 60 years from 1914-1974 to drive gold out of the monetary system. No central banker wants to let it back in.
 Still, what if they have no choice? What if confidence in command currencies collapses due to some combination of excessive money creation, competition from Bitcoin, extreme levels of Dollar debt, a new financial crisis, war or natural disaster?
 In that case, central bankers may return to gold not because they want to, but because they must in order to restore order to the global monetary system.
 That scenario begs the question: What is the new Dollar price of gold in a system in which Dollars are freely exchangeable for gold at a fixed price?
 If the Dollar price is too high, investors will sell gold for Dollars and spend freely. Central banks will have to increase the money supply to maintain equilibrium. That's an inflationary result.
 If the Dollar price is too low, investors will line up to redeem Dollars for gold and then hoard the gold. Central banks will have to reduce the money supply to maintain equilibrium. That reduces velocity and is deflationary.
 Something like the latter case happened in the UK in 1925 when it returned to a gold standard at an unrealistically low price. The result was that the UK entered the Great Depression several years ahead of other developed economies.
 Something like the former case happened in the US in 1933, when FDR devalued the Dollar against gold. Citizens weren't allowed to own gold, so there was no mass redemption of gold. But other commodity prices rose sharply.
 That was the point of the devaluation. Resulting inflation helped lift the US out of deflation and gave the economy a boost from 1933-1936 in the midst of the Great Depression. (The Fed caused another severe recession in 1937-1938 with their customary incompetence.)
 The policy goal obviously is to get the price ""just right"" by maintaining the proper equilibrium between gold and Dollars. The US is in an ideal position to do this by selling gold from US Treasury reserves, about 8,100 metric tonnes (261.5 million troy ounces), or buying gold in the open market using freshly printed Fed money.
 The goal would be to maintain the Dollar price of gold in a narrow range around the fixed price.
 What price is just right? This question is easy to answer, subject to a few assumptions.
 US M1 money supply is $17.9 trillion. I use M1 because it's a good proxy for everyday money. This is the supply that is the most liquid and money that is the easiest to turn into cash. It contains actual cash (bills and coins), bank reserves (what's actually kept in the vaults) and demand deposits (money in your checking account that can be turned into cash easily).
 One needs to make an assumption about the percentage of gold backing for the money supply needed to maintain confidence. I assume 40% coverage with gold. (This was the legal requirement for the Fed from 1913-1946. Later it was 25%, then zero today).
 Applying the 40% ratio to the $17.9 trillion money supply means that $7.2 trillion of gold is required.
 Applying the $7.2 trillion valuation to 261.5 million troy ounces yields a gold price of $27,533 per ounce.
 That's the implied non-deflationary equilibrium price of gold in a new global gold standard. Of course, money supplies fluctuate; lately they've been going up sharply, especially in the US
 There's room for debate about whether a 40% backing ratio is too high or too low. Still, my assumptions are moderate based on monetary economics and history. A Dollar price of gold of over $25,000 per ounce in a new gold standard is not a stretch.
 Obviously, you get around $12,500 per ounce if you assume 20% coverage. There are many variables in play.
 This model is also straightforward. It relies on factors we learned about in our first week of Intro to Economics – supply and demand.
 The most significant development on the supply side is the decrease of new mining output. As the chart shows below, mine production of gold in the US has been decreasing steadily since 2017.
 
 These figures reveal a 28% decrease over seven years, at the same time gold prices were rising and miners were motivated to expand output.
 That's not to argue that the world has reached ""peak gold,"" (output could expand in future for a variety of reasons). Still, my contacts in the mining community consistently report that gold is becoming more difficult to source and the quality of newly discovered ore is low-to-medium at best.
 Flat output, all things equal, tends to put a floor under prices and to support higher prices based on other factors.
 The demand side is driven largely by central banks, ETFs, hedge funds and individual purchases. Traditional institutional investors are not large investors in gold. Much of the demand from hedge funds is conducted in derivatives such as gold futures.
 Derivatives generally don't involve physical delivery of gold. They involve ""paper gold"" that far exceeds the actual, physical gold supply. It's this paper gold market that accounts for volatility in the gold market, not gold itself.
 Meanwhile, central bank demand for gold has surged from less than 100 tonnes in 2010 to 1,100 tonnes in 2022, a 1,000% increase in 12 years. Central bank gold demand remained strong in 2023. There's no sign of that demand slowing in 2024.
 Overall, the picture is one of flat supply and increasing demand, mostly in the form of official purchases by central banks.
 Finally, a bit of elementary math is helpful in understanding how the Dollar price of gold can move past $25,000 per ounce in the next two years. For this purpose, we'll assume a baseline price of $2,000 per ounce (although gold has been in the $2,300 range lately with no signs of falling back to the $2,000 level).
 But for our purposes, we'll keep it simple.
 A move from $2,000 per ounce to $3,000 per ounce is a heavy lift. That's a 50% increase and could easily take a year or more. Beyond that, a further increase from $3,000 to $4,000 is a 33% increase: another large rally. A further gain from $4,000 per ounce to $5,000 per ounce is a further gain of 25%.
 But notice the pattern. Each gain is $1,000 per ounce, but the percentage increase drops from 50% to 33% to 25%. That's because the starting point is higher while the $1,000 gain is constant. Each $1,000 jump represents a smaller (and easier) percentage gain than the one before.
 This pattern continues. Moving from $9,000 per ounce to $10,000 per ounce is only an 11% gain. Moving from $14,000 per ounce to $15,000 per ounce is only a 7% gain. Gold can move 1% in a single trading day, sometimes 2% or more.
 As an extreme example, a move from $99,000 per ounce to $100,000 per ounce is about a 1% move. Those $1,000 pops get even easier as we approach my calculated gold price of $27,533.
 The lesson for you as an investor is to buy gold now.
 As prices continue to rally, you'll get more gold for your money at the outset and high-percentage returns as gold rallies from a lower base. Toward the end of the long march past $25,000 per ounce, you'll have bigger Dollar gains because you started with more gold.
 Others will jump on the bandwagon, but you'll already have a comfortable seat."

Article:Pioneering platinum alloy for HDDs...

 The MARKET for hard disk drives (HDDs) is showing signs of a rebound after almost two years of decline, says the World Platinum Investment Council.
 That's thanks to the rapid growth in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) driving the need for expanded data storage.
 HDDs had been losing market share to solid state drives (SSDs), especially in consumer applications such as personal computers and gaming consoles. But according to Forbes, total HDD unit shipments in the last quarter of 2023 were up just under 1%, marking a turnaround in HDD demand, which had been in quarterly decline since the first quarter of 2022.
 HDDs are data storage devices comprised of magnetic platters coated with a platinum alloy media to improve thermal and magnetic stability, whereas SSDs use memory chips to store data, typically using a flash memory.
 Superior speed and increasing cost competitiveness with HDDs are two of the key drivers behind the growth in SSD adoption. However, HDDs are still lower cost than SSDs on a per gigabyte basis, meaning it remains the preferred option for organisations needing to store vast quantities of data.
 What is more, HDDs are benefiting from the introduction of heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, an innovation that is improving storage, or 'areal' density and so growing storage capacity without increasing HDD size or creating additional power requirements. These latter two features are of particular interest to the data centre segment which is deploying a broad range of solutions to better manage energy efficiency and storage capacity to reduce its carbon footprint.
 At the same time, cloud computing, AI, and machine learning are leading to rapidly growing demand for data storage capacity. Indeed, it is estimated that between 2024 and 2025, 30 zettabytes (30 trillion gigabytes) of data will be generated, while only two zettabytes of storage capacity will be manufactured.
 Earlier this year, Seagate, a leading innovator of sustainable mass-capacity data storage solutions, launched a new HAMR HDD equipped with a pioneering 'superlattice' platinum-alloy media, which significantly enhances disk performance, providing over three terabytes of storage density per platter and enabling its groundbreaking Seagate 'Exos' 30 terabyte hard drive.
 The hard drive areal density improvements achieved will enable its customers to store more data within the same footprint, economically and efficiently expanding the installed capacity of hard drive-based mass storage facilities, especially data centres.
 Meanwhile, computer drive manufacturer and data storage company Western Digital is also pushing 30-terabyte territory with its new generation of drives built with technology specifically designed for data centre customers who are looking for the highest capacity storage to help them achieve the lowest possible total cost of ownership.
 Western Digital's high-capacity 28 terabyte and 24 terabyte HDDs are built with 40% (by weight) recycled content and are around 10% more energy efficient per terabyte compared to its earlier generation products."
2024-05-15,"Title:Return of the Kitty
Article:A short history of meme squeezes...

 JUST when you thought trading couldn't get any crazier, meme stocks have suddenly reappeared – along with some of the more prominent speculators from the Covid Bubble era, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 ""Roaring Kitty"" – the infamous trader who made a killing by starting the grassroots short-squeeze movement that gave birth to some of the wildest runs in stock market history – suddenly reappeared on Twitter/X late Sunday following a three-year hiatus to spark another run in his beloved GameStop Corp. (GME).
 GME exploded higher in 24-hour trading on Robinhood late Sunday evening. The stock then promptly doubled Monday morning before getting hit with a mid-morning volatility halt. When the dust finally settled, GME closed with a gain of 75% on the day.
 The Kitty didn't post anything of substance to spark this furious rally – just a quick meme that made no mention of GME by name. But anyone who was even remotely in tune with the underbelly of the meme market knew exactly what he meant.
 For starters, GME shares were already on the move last week. The stock jumped 70% in just three trading days leading up to this week's explosive move. The fuse was lit – and Roaring Kitty pounced, inspiring an army of speculators to follow his lead.
 
 I opted for a longer-term view on this chart going back to 2020 to help put this recent rally into context. You can clearly see the huge move that catapulted GME into early 2021 on the left edge of the chart. While we've seen some echo rallies since the roaring Covid Bubble, nothing has come close to that epic run more than three years ago. Until now.
 Is this the beginning of another outrageous meme stock rally?
 If so, can a sober trader actually make money on these stocks...without losing his mind?
 Before we attempt to answer these questions, let's take a look at what happened to these stocks after the squeeze was over.
 Months after the echo rallies faded into oblivion, the formerly unstoppable meme stocks that captured the market's imagination faded back into obscurity. And late last summer, we finally put them to bed.
 The army of ragtag names was two years removed from its brief era of market domination – and most of the names were nearly unrecognizable from the early days of 2021.
 AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) resided at the bottom of the pile, down a cool 99% from its 2021 highs (a couple of reverse splits kept the stock afloat and listed in August 2023).
 Of course, AMC wasn't the only garbage stock to parlay its pandemic fame into a couple more years of reverse splits and common stock offerings. GameStop (GME) and Bed Bath & Beyond rounded out the ranks of the more popular trading names. And let's not forget the pandemic round-trippers. Zoom Video Communications (ZM), Peloton Interactive Inc. (PTON), and others experienced a brief yet powerful boom-bust cycle.
 But there was a distinct lack of hype during the late summer doldrums last year. At the time, I was able to dig up some stray articles on how AMC raised hundreds of millions of Dollars issuing stock to the deluded masses of online stock gamblers. Other than that, there was no media coverage at all – and this was a stock that was on the news every single day in early 2021.
 In the early days of the raging pandemic bull market, you couldn't escape these ridiculous meme stocks – and the throngs of speculators who believed they were somehow sticking it to the man by temporarily bullying the shares of a failing movie theater.
 But two short years later? Crickets...
 The meme stock revolution hit the market with a bang, we noted. And it died with a whimper.
 No one was buying these stocks. No one wanted to talk about them. There was a time when these trades couldn't lose. But in late 2023, it seemed as though no one could remember what all the fuss was about in the first place.
 The biggest, wildest speculations of the early part of the decade were no longer delivering the insane gains everyone expected.
 Traders cashed in what's left of their chips and went home. At the time, I assumed they wouldn't be back anytime soon. Yet here we are less than a year later, watching the familiar story beginning to emerge...
 Is it really happening all over again?
 It can be nearly impossible to maintain sanity and objectivity as these short squeezes unfold.
 Some investors become downright angry as these speculative bubbles develop, mainly because the extreme price action tends to reward bad behavior. Imagine practicing sound trading techniques for years, only to watch some kid with a Robinhood account book a six-figure gain YOLO-ing out-of-the-money weeklies.
 It's enough to drive a trader completely nuts.
 Unfortunately, most of these speculators won't keep the money they make on these trades. They'll plow the winnings into another long shot. And eventually, the market will even the score.
 One of the main mistakes I see when I venture onto the message boards is inexperienced traders putting way too much money into a single play – almost as a ""get rich or go broke trying"" strategy.
 But when you're dealing with these extreme stock moves, you don't have to risk a ton of capital to get involved and put up some impressive gains. Why bet the farm on what amounts to a spin of the roulette wheel?
 I'm not sure that any ""advice"" like this is useful when it comes to meme trades. But if you are going to venture into these shark-infested waters, try not to get sucked into the hype. These are not long-term investments. Don't sweat perfect entries. Take what you can get with tiny positions.
 And pack your bags early. When that last plane takes off, you don't want to be left standing on the runway."
2024-05-14,"Title:Gold vs. Inflation Expectations
Article:Let's check this via the mining stocks...

 The RELATIONSHIP between gold and inflation is not usually a positive for gold stocks, but that is changing, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 I want to call your attention to an article by Jordan Roy Byrne that provides information on ""everything you need to know about gold stocks.""
 Well, that is one man's subjective view of the situation, but he is a savvy and well grounded gold market watcher, so the whole article is worth a read. However, the last item caught my attention because as you may know, I have spent a lot of time debunking the well promoted myth that gold stocks should be bought as protection from or utility against inflation.
 Nothing could be further from the truth when said inflation is manufactured by monetary/fiscal policy and works to the benefit of the economy before it begins noticeably impairing the economy. There have been long stretches during which the manufactured inflation works positively for the economy.
 The proof of the assertions above has been gold's under-performance to cyclical assets and hence, gold miners' negative leverage to that performance. It's not rocket science if you stay unbiased. It's just the way it is and the way it has been much more often than not during the decades of the Continuum's gentle disinflationary journey southward. A journey that was rudely sent off course in 2022.
 
 While the 30-year Treasury yield continuum chart (among other things, an indicator of an oncoming era of impaired policymaker ability to respond to financial crises with inflationary 'bailout' policy) tempts me to veer from the post's original focus, I'll stay on track here. From Jordan's article:
 
 Whether ""the best"" indicator for gold stocks or merely one of the best, there is no arguing that Gold/CPI correlates well with the gold miners.
 One indication this chart holds for me is that of a transition into a counter-cycle as public fear of inflation (confidence that inflation is here to stay) has peaked but remains intact while gold creeps the counter-cyclical environment out ahead (post-election?).
 Related to Jordan's chart above, I have been including this chart of Gold/RINF (inflation expectations) and HUI, on a much shorter time frame, in NFTRH since we identified the positive divergence in Gold/RINF to HUI back in February.
 Since then Huey has zoomed upward to close the divergence. ""Inflation expectations"", ""CPI""...different flavors of the same general measure of what the public thinks of as ""inflation"".
 It will be important to keep these gold ratios (vs. inflation) in view going forward to continue to confirm the oncoming counter-cycle and as such, fundamentally positive era for gold miners, which will finally start to leverage gold's relative performance to the upside rather than the downside."
2024-05-12,"Title:Class Identity vs. Ghetto USA
Article:Incomes are finally rising...

 CONSIDER the defining characteristics of a ghetto, says Charles Hugh Smith in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.

 The residents can't afford to live elsewhere.
 Everything is a rip-off because options are limited and retailers/service providers know residents have no other choice or must go to extraordinary effort to get better quality or a lower price.
 Nothing works correctly or efficiently. Things break down and aren't fixed properly. Maintenance is poor to non-existent. Any service requires standing in line or being on hold.
 Local governance is corrupt and/or incompetent. Residents are viewed as a reliable ""vote farm"" for the incumbents, even though whatever little they accomplish for the residents doesn't reduce the sources of immiseration.
 The locale is unsafe. Cars are routinely broken into, there are security bars over windows and gates to entrances, everything not chained down is stolen – and even what is chained down is stolen.
 There are few viable businesses and numerous empty storefronts.
 The built environment is ugly: strip malls, used car lots, etc. There are few safe public spaces or parks that are well maintained and inviting.
 Most of the commerce is corporate-owned outlets; the money doesn't stay in the community.
 Public transport is minimal and constantly being degraded.
 They get you coming and going: Whatever is available is double in cost, effort and time. Very little is convenient or easy. Services are faraway.
 Residents pay high rates of interest on debt.
 There are few sources of healthy real food. The residents are unhealthy and self-medicate with a panoply of addictions to alcohol, meds, painkillers, gambling, social media, gaming, celebrity worship, etc.
 Nobody in authority really cares what the residents experience, as they know the residents are atomized and ground down, incapable of cooperating in an organized fashion, and therefore powerless.

I submit that these defining characteristics of ghettos apply to wide swaths of American life. Ghettos are not limited to urban zones; suburbs and rural locales can qualify as well.
 The defining zeitgeist of a ghetto is the residents are effectively held hostage by limited options and high costs: public and private-sector monopolies that provide poor quality at high prices.
 Daily life is a grind of long waits/commutes, low-quality goods and services, shadow work (work we have to do that we're not paid for that was once done as part of the service we pay for) and unhealthy addictions to distractions and whatever offers a temporary escape from the grind.
 We've habituated to being corralled into the immiseration of limited options and high costs; the immiseration and sordid degradation have been normalized into ""everyday life"".
 We've lost track of what's been lost to erosion and decay. We sense what's been lost but feel powerless to reverse it. This is the essence of the ghetto-ization of daily life.
 Behind the facade of normalization, even high-income lifestyles have been ghetto-ized. But saying this is anathema: Either be upbeat, optimistic and positive or remain silent.
 What's worse, the ghetto-ization or our inability to recognize it and discuss it openly?
 Two primary trends may be reversing: wage earners – labor – may be finally starting to regain some of the share of gross domestic income (GDI) lost to capital over the past 54 years, and economic class identity that collapsed in favor of individual identity – enabling the siphoning of $149 trillion in GDI from labor to capital since 1970 – may be reviving.
 The two trends are intertwined: the cultural dominance of identity politics came at the expense of economic class identity, which effectively blinded us as a nation to the multi-decade transfer of wealth from wage earners to owners/managers of capital.
 If we're wondering how the bottom 90% have lost ground, we can start with the social-cultural blindness to the collapse of class identity which enabled the dominance of capital politically, economically and socially, as manifested in the rise of globalization and financialization, the tools used to transfer income from labor to capital.
 Capital's increasing share of domestic income was not pre-ordained; it was the result of specific policy decisions, starting with globalization's downward pressure on domestic wages. The fancy term for forcing American workers to compete with other workers around the world whose cost of living is a fraction of ours is global wage arbitrage: capital shifted jobs to low-wage regions at will to increase profits at the expense of domestic wages.
 This is the fundamental advantage capital has over labor: Capital is globally mobile, labor is grounded in a particular place. Yes, workers can move around the world, too, but there are restrictions, both legal and in cost/sacrifice, as the effort and expense required to move from one country to another are significant.
 Capital doesn't care about a place or community; that's up to the residents. If capital shifts overseas to lower costs/increase profits, well, folks, make do with what's left.
 Financialization amplified capital's dominance of the economy, for capital gained tremendous power as credit and leverage expanded capital's scale and reach at the expense of domestic workers and communities.
 It's equally important to note that the corporate dominance generated by globalization and financialization also gutted small business and the local enterprises that provide the bulk of the jobs and cohesion in communities.
 The RAND study Trends in Income From 1975 to 2018 concluded that capital skimmed $50 trillion from labor from 1975-2018. Using data from the Federal Reserve's FRED database (series A4102E1A156NBEA), correspondent Alain M. calculated the actual sum for the period 1970-2022 (2022 being the most recent data available) was a staggering $149 trillion.
 If wage earners' share of gross domestic income had remained at 51% instead of declining to 43%, wage earners would have received an additional $149 trillion over those 52 years. That's roughly $3 trillion a year, which works out to an additional $22,000 annually for America's 134 million full-time workers or an additional $18,000 annually for the nation's entire workforce (full-time, part-time, self-employed, gig workers) of 163 million.
 No wonder the purchasing power of a day's work has declined to the point many cannot afford to buy a home or start a family or rent an apartment.
 Time magazine published a gloves-off summary of the RAND study in September 2020: The Top 1% of Americans Have Taken $50 Trillion From the Bottom 90% – And That's Made the US Less Secure.
 Consider these excerpts from the article:
 ""There are some who blame the current plight of working Americans on structural changes in the underlying economy – on automation, and especially on globalization. According to this popular narrative, the lower wages of the past 40 years were the unfortunate but necessary price of keeping American businesses competitive in an increasingly cutthroat global market. But in fact, the $50 trillion transfer of wealth the RAND report documents has occurred entirely within the American economy, not between it and its trading partners. No, this upward redistribution of income, wealth and power wasn't inevitable; it was a choice – a direct result of the trickle-down policies we chose to implement since 1975.
 ""We chose to cut taxes on billionaires and to deregulate the financial industry. We chose to allow CEOs to manipulate share prices through stock buybacks, and to lavishly reward themselves with the proceeds. We chose to permit giant corporations, through mergers and acquisitions, to accumulate the vast monopoly power necessary to dictate both prices charged and wages paid. We chose to erode the minimum wage and the overtime threshold and the bargaining power of labor. For four decades, we chose to elect political leaders who put the material interests of the rich and powerful above those of the American people.""
 That this level of incendiary outrage has seeped into the mainstream media tells us that the bill for America's gluttony of inequality is long overdue.
 The pendulum reached an extreme and is now starting to swing back, as evidenced by previously anti-union work forces (VW auto workers, for example) starting to vote in favor of unionization. Trillion-Dollar cartels/monopolies – the golden children of capital – are finally facing some pushback from their work forces and antitrust agencies.
 Here is the Federal Reserve chart of wage earners' share of gross domestic income:
 
 Note the basic structure of lower highs and lower lows: Labor's share of GDI recovers a bit of ground in ""good times"" – speculative bubbles and massive federal stimulus – and then reverts to trend once the bubbles pop.
 The substitution of identity politics for economic class identity has been catastrophic for the bottom 90% of the American workforce and the bottom 90% of American households. Capital can buy political influence to obtain policies that favor capital; the workforce has no power other than the cohesion generated by shared identity manifested in cooperative action in pursuit of economic shared interests.
 Corporate apologists and PR flacks like to demonize labor organizations as ""Marxist"" to misdirect us from the reality that labor organizations are necessary counterweights to corporate dominance.
 Once the counterweights have been stripped out, the system decays to what we have today: a hyper-globalized, hyper-financialized corporatocracy with zero interest in anything beyond maximizing private gains by whatever means are available (cough, doing God's work, Pelosi portfolio, cough). The net result is a failed state geared to serve the interests of the few at the expense of the many.
 A pendulum can only reach so far before it reverses and proceeds to the opposite extreme (minus a bit due to friction). Labor, capital and class identity are all starting to swing away from 50-year-plus extremes that decimated the financial security and share of domestic income of the bottom 90%.
 It's long overdue."
2024-05-11,"Title:Copper, Gold, Demand and Supply
Article:Amid the green energy push, look for balance...

 Two commodities have emerged as pivotal players as geopolitical tensions have escalated, influencing global financial markets: gold and copper, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 These metals are not merely survivors of market volatility but are thriving, charting a course that I believe savvy investors would be wise to monitor.
 As I've said countless times before, gold has long been considered a store of value in turbulent times, and now is no exception. Prices are near all-time highs, reflecting its enduring appeal during periods of uncertainty.
 Central banks, particularly in emerging markets, are increasing their gold reserves. The first quarter of 2024 saw institutions purchase a record 290 tons of gold, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). This unprecedented amount highlights a strategic shift toward the metal as a reserve currency and away from the US Dollar.
 
 While gold secures its position as a safe haven, copper is making headlines for different reasons. Often referred to as ""Dr. Copper"" for its ability to predict economic trends due to its widespread industrial applications, copper has also seen a significant price increase in recent days. The industrial metal climbed to a two-year high, supported by strong global economic activity, particularly surging demand driven by energy transition technologies like electric vehicles (EVs), wind and solar.
 The global copper market is tightening. Production challenges, such as stoppages and declining ore grades in major South American producers, are anticipated to limit supply growth this year, though rebound is expected in 2025.
 Despite these challenges, the demand for copper continues to grow, fueled by its critical role in green energy solutions. The International Copper Association (ICA) forecasts that copper demand will increase from 28.3 million metric tons in 2020 to 40.9 million metric tons by 2040, with a compound annual growth rate of 1.85%.
 The global manufacturing sector provides further insights. The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI saw a slight decline to 50.3 in April from a 20-month high of 50.6 in March, but it remains above the neutral mark, indicating expansion. This resilience in manufacturing suggests a sustained demand for industrial metals, reinforcing the bullish outlook for copper.
 
 Rising input costs and selling prices within the manufacturing sector point to building price pressures, likely contributing to inflation concerns. Such economic indicators are critical for investors to consider as they assess the potential impacts on commodity prices and investment returns.
 The shift toward a low-carbon economy is not just a policy preference but a potential investment theme. BloombergNEF reports that global investment in the energy transition reached a staggering $1.8 trillion in 2023, nearly doubling from 2020 levels. Such investments, particularly in regions like Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), are expected to drive further demand for copper, given its essential role in electrification and renewable energy infrastructures.
 
 For investors, the implications of these trends are clear. Gold remains a critical asset in any diversified portfolio, especially for those seeking to hedge against geopolitical risk and potential inflation. Persistently strong demand from central banks further supports the investment case for the yellow metal. I always recommend a 10% weighting, with 5% in physical gold (bars, coins, jewelry), the other 5% in high-quality gold mining stocks, mutual funds and ETFs.
 Not to be outdone, copper presents a compelling growth story tied to the global economic recovery and the transition to green energy. With the expected increase in demand and current supply constraints, prices may continue to rise, presenting a valuable opportunity for investors.

2024-05-10,"Title:Like Cocoa, Love Silver
Article:Can 'poor man's gold' make you rich...?

 The SILVER spot price peaked above $29 on April 12, and it's pulled back a bit. But that's no big deal, writes Byron King in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.   Like the rising gold price, which is over $2300 per ounce, it looks like there's more yet to come. In other words, precious metals are rapidly repricing.
 Right away, this tells me that Wall Street and the City of London have lost control over the price for gold and silver. From all appearances, pricing power has shifted East to India, China and other BRICS nations that now dominate physical purchases.
 If you bought gold or silver during the past decade, you must feel pretty good right now. The price is up, and apparently heading higher.
 So today, let's discuss silver and a looming, much larger price jump than what we've already seen.
 But first, cocoa! Like chocolate, it has recently melted up and exploded.
 Could this also happen with silver? Begin with the one-year cocoa chart:
 
 This chart covers June of last year to the present. It shows over a triple in price for cocoa, with the big move from $4,000 to $10,000 per tonne coming in the past two months.
 (By way of comparison, if this kind of price move happened with silver, we'd see the metal at over $80 per ounce; but this gets ahead of the story).
 Is this situation with cocoa normal? Do massive price moves occur routinely in the cocoa space? No, and this is kind of weird.
 Indeed, the current cocoa price has rapidly climbed to a historic high. It's unprecedented and here's a chart for the past 25 years to prove it:   
 Sure, over the years, cocoa has had ups and downs, but never an upward blowout like we see recently. This is definitely different, so what's going on?
 First, it's basic economics 101. There's a cocoa supply issue because of dry weather across equatorial regions of the world where people grow the crop. Per the map below, these areas range from East Asia to West Africa, and to the Caribbean and Central/South America.
 
 There's no need to delve into meteorology or climate issues. Just think in terms of not enough water or soil moisture to nurture the cocoa trees in key producing nations. Then consider dry conditions and many uncontrolled wildfires. Hence, a much smaller crop.
 The long and short is that the world's overall cocoa crop has fallen this past year. The problem cannot even begin to improve until next year and the next harvest season (with more rain along the way, growers hope).
 Meanwhile on the demand side, people across the world love their chocolate. Many people across the world enjoy the taste of chocolate, and it's no stretch to regard this kind of confection as a poor man's luxury, hence it enjoys a strong global market.
 In addition, market momentum has been a major factor pushing cocoa higher. This speculative component alone can exaggerate price moves.
 And just as with gold, the cocoa phenomenon may be a signal that price discovery is moving away from Western hands, towards the East.
 To sum up, the recent rise in cocoa price reflects a serious supply shortfall, rising demand, the need for new investment which will require time, and a sense of momentum as people watch the price levitate. All that in the face of a world where the very idea of price discovery is rebooting towards the East, away from traditional Western markets and trading pits.
 Silver isn't chocolate, but it has long been called ""the poor man's gold"". And silver is both an industrial and monetary metal.
 There's an ancient pedigree to silver as money. It's deep in the archaeological record. People write books about the history of silver as money (and on that point, I recommend The Story of Silver: How the White Metal Shaped America and the Modern World, William Silber, 2019).
 First, let's look at the silver price over the past 20 years:
 
 Note the huge run-up and back down in price, 2011-13; at one point silver was well over $40 per ounce (nearly $50 in 2011). Then, the metal traded in the mid-teens doldrums for a few years, 2014-2020.
 And after a jump in 2020 (related to Covid panic buying), silver's price support was range-bound in the low $20s for the past few years.
 Now, over those same 20 years, let's also compare the continuous contract price for gold and silver:
 
 Per the chart, silver and gold tracked closely through 2011-13; they both moved up and down pretty well in tandem. For the past decade, though, since 2014 silver has lagged gold, despite a strong run-up at one point in 2020 (the Covid panic-buy).
 For our purposes, silver has traded in a range in the past couple of years, and shows legacy weakness relative to gold, with an expanding gap even now. But can this change? Can silver pull off a ""slingshot"" effect and deliver strong gains?
 Think like a cocoa trader for a moment. In terms of demand, silver is popular in ways that are sticky, if not inelastic.
 Begin with the monetary angle despite the fact that silver is no longer used in the world's currencies; it's absent from US coinage, for example, since a law in 1965 that took silver out of circulation.
 But across the world, individuals, businesses, and governments (China and India come to mind) still buy silver, including old coins and definitely raw silver bullion. Silver-stacking is a worldwide phenomenon.
 Meanwhile, silver is a crucial industrial metal; a key to every imaginable kind of electronics and absolutely necessary in the fast-growing sector of solar power. All this, and silver has growing uses in fields ranging from water purification to medical products like antiseptic bandages.
 Thus, its demand is solid and growing.
 As for supply, statistics from the global Silver Institute show that global silver output from mines is basically flat, if not declining. Countries like Mexico, Peru and China struggle just to maintain production at levels of previous years. Large silver-producing companies like Fresnillo, Newmont, Glencore and more show declining numbers.
 Thus, it's not far-fetched to say that the world may be at ""peak silver"" just now.
 And yes, of course, we have exploration plays for silver out there, and more than a few strong developers. I follow the mining space and I've seen and visited many great, promising companies.
 But as with cocoa, these silver plays aren't turnkey operations. All will require time for new silver deposits to see the light of day; time plus immense levels of capital to build mines, mills and related infrastructure.
 Oh, and to find and train a new workforce because much of the present labor pool is ""legacy,"" if you get my drift.
 And what about momentum? Well, the price of silver has moved up in recent weeks, but it's not quite a rocket-ride like cocoa; not yet anyhow.
 Then again, people tend not to see tipping points, nor to appreciate how rapidly they can occur. That is, you may awaken one morning, and the price of something (like cocoa or perhaps silver) will be on a tear, and to the casual observer it will make no sense.
 Whatever the case, the question to ask yourself is if you are on the silver train right now, before it all begins to move very much? Or will you wait it out a while, until you're sure the train is rolling? Or will you be the one running down the platform, trying to grab onto something before it all leaves the station?
 Another point to consider is what has happened with price discovery in metals in general, and precious metals in particular. Gold has definitely moved, by over $300 in just the past four months.
 The formerly routine daily sell-down in, say, New York just can't beat out the global army of bidders who want to move towards some semblance of monetary safety as the US government destroys its currency in an orgy of growing debt and interest payments.
 Final takeaway: Silver is moving, and I suspect it will do a slingshot to catch up with gold in terms of relative value, metal for metal. Own physical, of course.
 Own paper silver if you want to trade the space (eg: iShares Silver Trust: SLV). And own silver producers like Pan American Silver (PAAS), MAG Silver (MAG), Hecla (HL), or Silvercrest (SILV).
 Of course, there are many other smaller plays in the silver exploration, development and mining space, many with great fundamentals and assets, and massive upside.
 By every indication, the metal is moving, so you should buy a ticket and get on the train."
2024-05-09,"Title:Can You Spell Stagflation?
Article:I see no 'stag' or 'flation' says the Fed...

 MOST economists don't believe we could have stagflation today, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 The prevailing view is that recessions are characterized by higher unemployment and reduced spending, and inflation is triggered by full employment and increased spending. Therefore they cannot both happen at the same time.
 This prevailing view is wrong, yet it's a powerful narrative that blinds most analysts to situations where stagnation and inflation are both happening at the same time.
 That's stagflation, and it is emerging today.
 The first wing of the stagflation thesis is stagnant growth. This can take the form of an outright recession (two consecutive quarters of declining GDP) or simply slow growth at a rate below the potential growth of a strong economy.
 The US economy has grown in recent years, but growth has remained below historical averages.
 What growth we have had wasn't due to monetary policy. It's been the result of extreme fiscal policy including annual deficits that are now approaching $3 trillion per year. Fiscal policy that involves direct government deficit spending does produce growth that monetary policy cannot. The question is: at what cost?
 Basic Keynesian economics holds that government spending at a time of recession or when consumer savings are too high can stimulate growth. If the national debt is moderate, it's possible to get more than $1.00 of growth for $1.00 of government spending financed by borrowing.
 Today, these conditions don't apply.
 The national debt-to-GDP ratio is 134%, the highest in US history. Government spending is often directed at non-productive projects such as the Green New Scam and subsidizing illegal immigration.
 When debt rises faster than GDP, which it presently is, the debt-to-GDP ratio grows, and the Keynesian multiplier shrinks. You are trying to borrow and spend your way out of a debt crisis, which can only end in default (unnecessary since the US can print Dollars) or hyperinflation (likely).
 Those extreme outcomes (default or hyperinflation) happen in the endgame, which can be years away. What happens in the meantime is not much better.
 Any debt-to-GDP ratio above 90% will produce a Keynesian multiplier of less than 100%. With a debt-to-GDP ratio of 134% the US can only expect more debt and weaker growth from fiscal policy.
 This may provide a short-term boost for Biden in an election year, but it's a long-term drag on growth for the US In the end, the US is now Japan. The Japanese debt-to-GDP ratio is about 300%.
 Japan has been in one long depression since 1990 punctuated by nine separate technical recessions. Japan cannot ""stimulate"" its way to growth. They can only continue deficit spending to prop up nominal growth while making their debt ratio and slow-growth problems worse.
 The US (and much of the world) is following the same path. Stagnation in the form of weak growth and occasional recession is the future of the US economy despite recent strong quarters.
 As for inflation, there is no debate. Inflation has been going up for three straight months. In fact, inflation has been in a persistent range centered around 3.3% for 10 months. Inflation is back. In truth, it never went away.
 Oil prices are one factor. The price of oil was $68.50 per barrel in. It peaked above $86 in early April and has since pulled back. But the trend has been higher.
 That oil price surge has not worked its way through the supply chain yet. It's resulted in some price increases, but more are in the pipeline. It'll keep inflation at current levels or higher in the months ahead.
 The Fed is looking for signs that inflation is coming down but they're not going to get them.
 Other factors driving inflation from the supply side include the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the closing of the Red Sea/Suez Canal shipping route and continued fallout from Ukraine war sanctions. Some of these supply side constraints may be deflationary in the long run but they are definitely inflationary in the short run.
 When you add it all up, the inflation hypothesis is strong and getting stronger. Growth is also slowing, as I explained above, so both components of the stagflation thesis are intact.
 But the Fed and their Wall Street toadies can't see that.
 That's because the Fed forecasting models are junk science. Those models will always get the wrong result. If that's true (it is), and if Wall Street is following the Fed (they are), then Wall Street will get the forecast wrong also. It's the blind leading the blind.
 We can start with the Phillips curve. This model says that there is an inverse correlation between unemployment and inflation. If unemployment is low, one should expect inflation to be high, and vice versa. The rationale is that tight labor markets lead to wage demands that increase spending and feed inflation.
 The problem is there's no empirical data to support the model.
 In the early 1960s, the US had low unemployment and low inflation. As late as 1965, inflation was only 1.6%. In the late 1970s, the US had high unemployment and high inflation. Inflation peaked at 13.5% in 1980. Unemployment that year was 7.8%.
 Unemployment peaked at 10.8% in November 1982. Inflation that year was still 6.1%. In the 1930s, the US had high unemployment and low inflation (actually deflation). Unemployment was estimated at about 24% in 1932. Inflation that year was negative 10.3%.
 In 1973-1975, the US had low unemployment and high inflation. In October 1973 unemployment was only 4.6%. Inflation that year was 6.2% on its way to 11.1% in 1974.
 In other words, the Phillips curve is junk science. There are many causes of both unemployment and inflation, but a strict inverse relationship is not one of them.
 The Fed also takes the view that interest rate cuts offer ""stimulus"" and interest rate hikes offer ""monetary tightening"". That's also false.
 During times of severe economic distress (the Great Depression is a good example), interest rates drop to near zero. When economies are booming, interest rates rise because companies are competing for more funds to expand capacity and to make investments.
 Things can go too far. High rates will eventually lead to overcapacity and recession. Low rates will eventually lead to investment opportunities and a new expansion. But those turning points happen at the extremes as part of a normal business cycle. In the normal state of affairs, higher rates are associated with good times and low rates are associated with recessions or worse.
 The Fed has this exactly backward. The Fed doesn't lead the business cycle, it chases it.
 In short, the Fed is persisting in tight monetary policy in order to fight inflation. But this inflation is caused by supply-side disruptions (oil and transportation bottlenecks) and a range of other factors the Fed doesn't control.
 The Fed is tightening into what may quickly become a recession. This is a recipe for stagflation."
2024-05-07,"Title:Western Gold Investing Rebounds from Record Low
Article:New record high gold prices still spur profit-taking...


              
           


GOLD INVESTING among Western households rebounded from a record low in April, jumping at the fastest pace in almost 4 years on the Gold Investor Index as gold prices leapt to extend 2024's run of fresh all-time highs, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             The number of first-time investors in gold also rebounded, helping offset further profit-taking among existing holders and cutting the pace of net selling by more than two-thirds from the record outflow of March.
           

              
           

             But while this spring's rebound in Western gold bullion investing is dramatic, our data show that it comes off a very low base. It also hasn't reversed the relentless selling out of 
            gold-backed ETF trust funds or stemmed 
            the West's ongoing liquidation of gold coins and small bars.
           

              
           

             So with prices setting yet more all-time gold highs in April – and now holding firm at what were new records only a month ago – that shows just how strong gold demand is running among Asian investors and savers, most especially in 
            China's private-sector gold demand.
           

              
           

             Emerging-market central banks also continue accumulating gold bullion as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza worsen geopolitical and financial tensions between the major powers.
           

              
           

             Straw in the wind, perhaps. But are Western investors finally about to join them?
           

              
           




              
           

             The Gold Investor Index tracks the number of people buying gold against the number of net sellers on BullionVault, the world-leading precious metals marketplace for private investors.
           

              
           

             Now caring for a record $4.4 billion of securely vaulted and insured gold, silver, platinum and palladium in total (£3.5bn, €4.1bn, JPY699bn) for over 100,000 users from 175 countries worldwide, the West London fintech finds 9-in-10 of its client-base living in Western Europe or North America.
           

              
           

             BullionVault's gold index last month reversed March's drop to a new series low of 47.5, rebounding by 4.1 points – the steepest jump since gold prices first broke above $2000 per Troy ounce in August 2020 – to read 51.6 on our unique data series.
           

              
           

             Averaging 54.4 over the past decade, the Gold Investor Index reads 50.0 if the number of net buyers equals the number of net sellers. It set a series record of 71.7 in September 2011, height of the global financial crisis, and peaked again at 65.9 as Covid lockdowns swept the world in March 2020.
           

              
           

             Led by new all-time highs in Shanghai gold prices, the London bullion market set 
            a record run of 8 new daily gold price records in a row at the start of April, with the precious metal then peaking above $2400 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             On a month-average basis, gold priced in Dollars rose to a new record of $2335, up 8.2% from March and 15.4% higher than February. That was the strongest 2-month rise since February 2009, when Western stock markets hit 12-year lows as central banks led by the US Fed began QE and zero interest rates following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
           

              
           

             So what began this New Year as a stealth rally in gold has finally grabbed Western investors' attention. Indeed, this remarkable jump in gold prices echoes the precious metal's bull runs of the 1970s and 2000s. And while the heat has clearly come out of 
            Shanghai and Comex derivatives gold betting for now, the underlying uptrend in gold remains in place. So do the factors driving it, with China experiencing its own 'Lehman's moment' of investment and economic stress while tensions between the rich West and the rest-of-the-world continue to worsen.
           

              
           

Take note: The Western world's leading gold investment marketplace flipped back to a positive balance of gold buyers over sellers last month. But investor selling continued to outweigh buying in April.
           

              
           

             Net liquidation of 0.6% took BullionVault client holdings down to the lowest since September 2020 – peak of the Covid Crisis gold-price surge – at 45.2 tonnes.
           

              
           

             The rate of net selling slowed hard however, dropping by 70.9% compared to March's record heavy outflow of nearly 1.0 tonne. That let the rising price of gold take the value of BullionVault client gold holdings up by 3.5% at month-end to a second new record in a row at $3.3 billion (+4.4% to £2.6bn, +4.3% to €3.1bn, +7.8% to JPY529bn).
           

              
           

             Driving last month's rebound in the Gold Investor Index, the number of people choosing to invest in gold for the first time on BullionVault also leapt in April, jumping by 65.0% from March's count and rising 86.7% from the prior 12-month average, which had fallen to a 5-year low.
           

              
           

             Last month's jump in new users – the sharpest jump since April 2020, when the Covid crisis unleashed record-heavy gold demand by a record number of Western investors – was led by a 95.9% rise in the UK versus its 12-month average and a rise of 88.1% in France. New interest in the USA was more muted, rising only 39.5%, while Germany rallied just 24.6%.
           

              
           




              
           

             Like gold, the price of silver leapt for a second month running in April, rising by 12.8% from March in US Dollar terms and gaining 21.6% from February – its fastest 2-month rise since September 2020, peak of the Covid crisis' surge in precious metals prices. – to beat May 2021's monthly average at $27.58 per Troy ounce, the highest since March 2013.
           

              
           

             But unlike gold, the Silver Investor Index bounced only weakly from March's new series low of 45.0 to reach 47.3. That would have been a record series low prior to the run starting last November.
           

              
           

             Silver holdings by weight meantime saw a second new record outflow in a row, with investors using BullionVault liquidating 32 tonnes of the more industrially-useful precious metal net of client demand. But by value, those holdings also set their 2nd new all-time high in a row, rising above $1 billion for the first time since we added securely vaulted and insured silver to BullionVault's existing gold offering at New Year 2010.
           

              
           

             All-in-all, last month's rebound in new precious metal investors came off a very low base, and it needed a record run of new record prices to gain attention. The rebound in the Gold Investor Index also came off a record low, and – to date – silver has seen only further profit-taking and net liquidation as prices leap to decade highs.
           

              
           

             Straws in the wind, in short. For now, the price action is being driven outside the West. And existing gold and silver investment owners in the West remain happy, for now, to bank the resulting gains."
2024-05-04,"Title:A Tale of Two Mega-Caps
Article:Why bad earnings are good...

 WE'RE SMACK in the middle of another exciting earnings season, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 It's once again that magical time of the quarter when investors become confused, angry (or both!) when stocks don't react as they expect after filing their quarterly updates.
 Why are earnings so tough on armchair investors?
 It might have something to do with all the confusing numbers and analyst estimates floating around. Or maybe it's because the financial media stirs the pot by quick-calling after-hours reactions, only to update their coverage when a stock abruptly changes direction following the conference call Q&A.
 But the most frustrating part about earnings season is that stocks don't react appropriately once the numbers hit the wire – at least, not in the minds of most investors. More often than not, a stock will behave differently than one might logically expect, even when earnings perfectly adhere to analyst expectations.
 Unfortunately, there's no quick fix that will make earnings season more palatable for the average investor. Companies will continue to dish out fresh reports every three months, and investors and traders will simply have to do their best to navigate the uncertainty.
 As long as you're involved in markets, you'll have to deal with the occasional earnings shenanigans. So it's best if you learn to embrace the madness...
 Today, I'll show you that it is possible to ride the earnings wave without losing your mind. The secret to earnings zen doesn't involve scouring estimates, analyst reports, or insider transactions. You simply need to learn how to put the earnings announcements into context with the forces affecting a stock's price and trend.
 Let's check out a couple of recent high-profile earnings reactions that have frustrated the investing masses.
 Earlier this month we witnessed Tesla Inc. (TSLA) rally off 52-week lows, closing higher by more than 12% after reporting an earnings miss.
 The very next day, investors were forced to watch Meta Platforms Inc. (META) crater more than 15% after beating both top and bottom-line estimates.
 Moves like these are why so many people are distrustful of the stock market. They have no idea what to make of price action not matching up with top and bottom-line numbers parroted on the financial news.
 The Tesla news alone unleashed more than its fair share of angry comments across social media.
 Demand for EVs is falling off a cliff! Tesla's free cash flow flipped negative! Profits are hitting 3-year lows!
 But none of these facts prevented Tesla shares from rocketing off their lows as traders appeared blissfully unaware that anything could be wrong with the company's business prospects.
 Meanwhile, Meta has been a Wall Street darling since it bottomed in early 2023. Shares were up 450% from their 2022 lows ahead of its earnings announcement last week. The stock was also up 40% year-to-date ahead of earnings – the opposite action we had seen from Tesla during the first quarter.
 While Tesla's financials were a mess, Meta actually posted some impressive numbers. The company beat earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, extending its fiscal comeback from the dark days of its metaverse pivot in late 2021 – early 2022.
 But slightly lower second-quarter expectations stuck out to investors despite the strong Q1 showing. After a perfect start to the year, sellers came out in full force and sent the stock lower by double-digits to its worst showing in 18 months.
 To truly understand why the market reacted as it did, we have to zoom out and place the earnings into the context of the bigger price trends shaping these two popular stocks.
 On one hand, we have sputtering TSLA shares that have already coughed up more than 40% year-to-date. TSLA broke from its Magnificent Seven brethren in late December and spent most of the first quarter digging itself into a deep hole.
 Most investors expected the worst. In fact, sentiment couldn't have been more bearish heading into last week's announcement. Combine that with the strong downtrend and breakdown to fresh lows, and you have a recipe for a big bounce on mediocre results. Tesla only needed a report that was slightly better than apocalyptic to spark a short covering rally. And that's exactly what happened!
 The opposite was true for Meta. The stock was on a historic run, posting one of the best-looking charts amongst the mega-caps extending back to the 2022 bear market lows. This strong uptrend plus the fact that Meta shares extended to new all-time highs following its previous earnings beat left little room for error.
 Anything less than a ""perfect"" earnings report would of course entice investors to take profits – which is exactly what happened. Tesla just needed to prove the wheels weren't falling off their cars to attract buyers, while Meta needed to dazzle analysts and investors to maintain its
 Heck, even if this premarket drop holds, META shares won't completely fill the earnings gap higher from early February (the stock jumped 20%-plus following its last quarterly earnings release).
 Bottom line: earnings reactions are all about expectations – just not the expectations everyone talks about. You have to separate the financials from how the herd feels about a stock. The best way to do that is to analyze prices and trends."
2024-05-02,"Title:Those Bank of England Gold Sales, 25 Years After the 'End of History'
Article:How the Brown Bottom happened, why it matters today...


              
           


TUESDAY next week will mark 25 years since the UK Government said it would start selling off half the nation's gold reserves two months later, 
            writes Adrian Ash in this note sent to BullionVault users in their latest Weekly Update
             email.
           

              
           

             Gold's price sank on the news, dropping to new 2-decade lows.
           

              
           

             That was close to rock-bottom, as it turned out...
           

              
           

             ...and pretty much the lowest prices in history in real terms.
           

              
           




              
           

             News of the sales caused 
            a lot of fuss back in May 1999.
           

              
           

             It caused 
            more fuss on the 20th anniversary in May 2019...
           

              
           

             ...and it's already got 
            more coverage again this spring ahead of the silver anniversary.
           

              
           

             So let's not waste time unpicking the whole saga here. Because only 3 things matter today.
           

              
           

First, everyone was to blame, not just the UK's 
            late-1990s finance minister (and short-lived Prime Minister) Gordon Brown.
           

              
           

             Yes, his ham-fisted fingerprints were all over the announcement. And yes, the timing and method seem willful. But investors were AWOL (piling into DotCom shares instead)...
           

              
           

             ...while the media kept saying what a dumb investment gold was...
           

              
           

             ...and even gold miners had been shorting the metal, borrowing and selling it to lock in the price of future production, and thus helping it fall still lower in price.
           

              
           

             As for sovereign nations, the UK was far from the first or largest gold holder to dump bullion from its reserves. And why not? The 
            fin de siecle, after all, marked 
            the end of history...the inevitable triumph of ""Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government"" to quote the 
            zeitgeist's handbook. Who 
            needed gold when we had Alan Greenspan running the Fed?
           

              
           

             Canada, Australia and Argentina sure didn't. They had all slashed their state holdings by 1998. Austria and the Netherlands had both halved their gold reserves too, while Belgium...
           

              
           

             ...like them, a founder of the single Euro project due to launch at the turn of the Millennium...
           

              
           

             ...had already sold 40%. France would then join the fun in 2004, selling a fifth of its bullion over the next five years. That left only the USA, Germany and Italy (still gold's top three hoarders today on the official data) as unwavering holders among rich Western economies.
           

              
           

             Most urgently, the UK announcement came just a month after the USA backed called for the International Monetary Fund to sell gold, and it was only 3 weeks after voters in Switzerland had passed a referendum ending the Franc's gold backing in law.
           

              
           

             That freed the Swiss National Bank to start cutting its massive holdings. 
            Which it did.
           

              
           

             But again, the big picture trend wasn't new.
           

              
           




              
           

             See how state control of gold peaked around WW2...
           

              
           

             ...back when private ownership of gold was illegal in the USA and 
            Nazi troops headed first to the central bank of the neighboring nations they flattened and invaded?
           

              
           

             Then see where its decline slowed from a plunge to a slide around 2010...?
           

              
           

             The global financial crisis put a stop to Western central banks selling gold. It also spurred Russia and most dramatically China to start hoarding...
           

              
           

             ...because Washington, Frankfurt, London and Tokyo were actively devaluing the 'reserve' currencies pouring into Moscow and Beijing's central banks to pay for all the gas and gadgets Russia and China churn out.
           

              
           

             No, none of the Western central banks selling gold around the Millennium have yet re-invested. But a growing number of nations on 'our side' have bought...
           

              
           

             ...including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Poland, Singapore...
           

              
           

             ...alongside many of the friendlier 'rest' ranging from Brazil, India and Mexico to Saudi Arabia and Thailand.
           

              
           

Lesson for today? It's always darkest just before things go utterly black. But trends come and go. Even if, in gold, things can take a few decades or more to turn around.
           

              
           

Second, the UK's decision really was awful. It gave the market 2 months' notice before starting to sell, a move that caused outrage at the time but only looks worse in hindsight. Because little known back then, the Bank of England...
           

              
           

             ...seeking a small yield from the nation's gold on behalf of its owner, the Treasury...
           

              
           

             ...had 
            already lent out half as much as bullion as it would divest, literally handing the market the metal it needed to front-run the sales between 1999's May announcement and the start of sales that July.
           

              
           

             The Bank then sold some 395 tonnes of bullion at a series of auctions ending May 2002, just less than 8% of the world's net official-sector sales across the three decades ending 2010. It achieved an average price of $275 per Troy ounce, almost $13 below the London price on the eve of the announcement, and $900 below gold's average price since the sales ended.
           

              
           

             Today the precious metal is trading above $2300, worth four times what it bought a quarter-century ago in real terms after UK inflation. And in nominal terms, selling all that bullion between July 1999 and March 2002 raised £15 billion less than if the UK had sold over the 33 months ending this April.
           

              
           

             But really, that's nothing. The Bank of England is on track to lose £100 billion on its QE bond purchases according to the Office for Budget Responsibility...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...selling now that interest rates have jumped (and bond prices sunk) after buying when bond yields were low (and prices were high).
           

              
           

             That's set to lock in a loss worth well over 4% of one year's GDP. Unlike the 'missed profit' of Gordon Brown's gold sales, it's also a cost borne by taxpayers under a deal between the Bank and Treasury...
           

              
           

             ...a dreadful price after the public acted so selflessly, and without being asked, in ""
            maintaining financial stability across the United Kingdom's banking system.""
           

              
           

Lesson for today? The UK's gold error 25 years ago was, in cash terms at least, a drop in the bucket compared to the Western world's monetary meddling since then.
           

              
           

Third and last, 
            don't blame gold's 1999-2002 price lows entirely on Western central banks selling off so much metal.
           

              
           

             Oh sure, the 1999-2002 lows in the gold price soon became known as the Brown Bottom. 
           

              
           

             But 3 decades earlier, central-bank sales had met such a rush from investors that they 
            killed what remained of the Gold Standard in 1971.
           

              
           

             Heavy sales in the late 1970s then coincided with gold prices surging to what remain all-time highs for US investors in real terms.
           

              
           

Lesson for today? Every sale needs a buyer, but who those people are...and how their decisions go together to decide the direction of prices...are far from fixed.
           

              
           

             Right now 
            the rich West is selling gold yet again today, but less aggressively than 25 years ago and this time only from private investors, rather than from national reserves.
           

              
           

             Today's net selling also contrasts with the Western world's post-financial crisis outflows of gold in 2013-2015, even though...just like then...the 
            eager buyers live mostly in China, whether as private households, investors or central-bank managers.
           

              
           

             The big difference, of course, is price. Gold in 1999 had rarely been cheaper in real terms. Whereas 25 years later it's now running at 
            the most valuable since the Wars of the Roses on our rough-and-ready analysis of the best available data.
           

              
           

             Does that mark the top? Not even the most die-hard technical analyst would trust the lines on a chart using estimates for long-run inflation and gold prices made over 5 centuries later.
           

              
           

             But whatever comes next, the UK and wider Western world's central-bank gold sales of 25 years ago started ugly and continue to age badly. Who knows whether, this time, China's central-bank bosses are mispricing the ultimate crisis investment."
2024-05-01,"Title:Scrap Gold Recycling Jumps, Mining Output Set for Record Year
Article:Little 'distress' selling so far as gold price hits new records...


              
           


SUPPLY to the global gold market set its highest first-quarter total since 2016 in January-to-March, new data says, with record-high prices spurring a jump in secondhand and scrap recycling as strong mining output put the sector on track for a record full-year total.
           

              
           

             Re-sales of jewelry plus technology-use metal rose 12.5% from a year before according to figures from mining-industry body the World Gold Council, hitting the highest level since Q3 2020, when a break in global Covid lockdown policies 
            enabled consumers to raise cash amid that crisis' economic slump and then-all-time-high gold prices.
           

              
           

             Mine supply meanwhile rose 4.4% year-on-year, setting its second record Q1 figure in a row and suggesting that 2024 will beat 2018's full-year peak of 3,656 tonnes.
           

              
           

             Led by double-digit growth in Canada, Ghana and Indonesia – and with output from world No.1 mining nation China rising some 5% – the growth in mined output has so far failed to boost the stock-market value of Western-listed operators, now up 8.0% in 2024 to date, barely half the percentage gain in 
            physical gold bullion prices.
           

              
           

             Amid today's ""increasingly favourable price environment...additional supply [will start] coming on-stream in the next two years,"" say specialist analysts Metals Focus – the consultancy behind the gold supply and demand trends' data published this week by the WGC – ""primarily driven by North America.""
           

              
           




              
           

             Back in the first quarter of 2024, ""Increases [in the second-hand gold flow] were seen in almost all markets and regions,"" says 
            the World Gold Council's latest report.
           

              
           

             ""But the [global scrap] increase has been more modest than some may have been expecting given the gold price ascent"" with a sharp rise in Thailand still ""remaining below levels seen during the pandemic"" while there were ""very few reports of distress selling"" in No.2 consumer market India or across Europe, even as 
            net demand for gold coins and small 'retail investment' bars in Western economies sank on 
            a surge of gold profit taking.
           

              
           

             Recycling volumes in the USA ""increased only marginally,"" the WGC goes on – a sharp contrast to 
            the 'cash4gold' phenomenon amid gold's price surge during the global financial crisis – and ""trade rather than retail flows were behind the uptick"" as jewelry stores sold excess inventory into this spring's new record-high prices.
           

              
           

             But world No.1 gold consumer China saw household selling increase more notably, mirroring a slowdown in new jewelry purchases. Indeed, ""some small and medium-sized processing companies have suspended operations and taken holidays"" 
            reported the China Gold Association last week as ""rapidly rising gold prices have increased wait-and-see sentiment"" among would-be buyers, leading to slower demand across the jewelry supply chain even as 
            China's gold coin, small bar, ETF, banking app and speculative demand has jumped.
           

              
           

             As for gold mining supply, ""the new projects coming on-stream tend to have a long mine life and are cost competitive,"" says 
            Metals Focus, ""making them resilient throughout gold price cycles.""
           

              
           

             Record-high costs still offered the industry a profit margin of 46.9% in the final quarter of 2023 on an all-in sustaining basis. But while analysts at S&P Global's Commodity Insights foresee AISC falling for the largest Western-listed mining firms across the next 5 years – ""providing a catalyst for some upside to future [stock market] performance – their gold production per share has almost halved across the past 15 years, notes Metals Focus.
           

              
           

             ""Several gold mining companies are once again issuing new equity,"" diluting the profits for shareholders still further."
2024-04-21,"Title:China's Private Gold Demand Nears 1% of GDP at Record Prices
Article:Wholesale SGE gold buying +30% year-on-year by Yuan value...


              
           


CHINA's GOLD DEMAND in the first quarter rose to the highest by weight in 5 years according to data from the Shanghai Gold Exchange, and it hit a near-decade high in value terms as a proportion of the No.1 gold buying nation's gross domestic product.
           

              
           

             China reported solid GDP growth last week, with the world's 2nd largest economy 
            expanding by 5.3% in January-to-March from the same period last year on figures from NBS, Beijing's official data agency.
           

              
           

             But with China's property market continuing to fall, its stock market hitting 5-year lows, and cash interest rates stuck at historic lows, Chinese households and investors have poured money into gold, helping drive the global price up to 
            new record highs at $2400 per Troy ounce of gold bullion in London and above ¥500 per gram in Shanghai.
           

              
           

             To feed this trend, wholesale gold demand through the Shanghai Gold Exchange – the only legal route for bullion to enter private circulation in China – rose 12.3% by weight in January-to-March from the first quarter of 2023, reaching the heaviest Q1 total since 2019 on SGE withdrawals data.
           

              
           

             The first quarter includes the key Lunar New Year and Spring Festival holiday, now the busiest gold-buying season worldwide, beating India's autumn festival of Diwali.
           

              
           

             But on top of that seasonal gifting demand, the start of 2024 saw such strong private-sector investment in China that the value of its wholesale gold demand leapt 30.3% from a year earlier, beating Q1 2019 by 71.3% and equating to 0.86% of the country's GDP on analysis by BullionVault – the highest first-quarter proportion since 2015.
           

              
           




              
           

             ""As we [now] enter the traditional 'off season' for demand,"" says Ray Jia, research head China for the mining industry's World Gold Council, ""gold jewellery consumption is 
            likely to remain tepid, especially with a local gold price that keeps refreshing record highs.
           

              
           

             ""[But] the shining performance of gold compared to other local assets has attracted increasing attention from investors. And this could mean continued strength for gold investment demand in China.""
           

              
           

             Alongside further falls in China's property sector, Q1 2024 saw China's CSI300 stock-market index hit 5-year lows, bottoming at less than half its value at the peak of early 2021.
           

              
           

             Yuan gold prices in contrast rose 10.1%, setting a new all-time record high on 13 out of the first quarter's 59 trading days at the SGE and averaging a record quarter-average premium to London quotes of $40 per Troy ounce – five times the typical incentive for new bullion imports.
           

              
           

             ""As domestic assets such as equities and real estate weakened,"" says trade body the China Gold Association, ""the impressive 
            performance of the gold price in Renminbi has attracted [Chinese] investors looking for safe-haven assets, which led to continued demand.""
           

              
           

             Retail-store demand for gold coins and small bars is ""booming"" says investment-news website STCN, and people ""are also enthusiastic about investing in gold through mobile and online banking"" plus major platforms Ant Fortune, JD.com Finance, and Tencent Financial Management Connect.
           

              
           

             Gold's No.1 mining, importing, central-bank buying and private consumer nation, China accounts for 1-in-6 people on Earth.
           

              
           

             ""Gold prices are high and trading is hot,"" says China's Securities Times, with speculative betting on gold prices through the Shanghai Futures Exchange also jumping so far in 2024."
2024-04-19,"Title:Financialization: The Hegemon's Last Gasp
Article:How the US economy switched from factory floor to trading floor...

 The UNITED STATES is largely a ""financialized"" economy, writes Brian Maher at The Daily Reckoning.
 Financialization: ""The increase in size and importance of a country's financial sector relative to its overall economy.""
 Is financialization a sickness of corroding empires? Do previous examples exist?
 These are the questions we tackle today.
 The financial industry represented 10% of the gross domestic product in 1970.
 By 2010 the financial system ballooned to 20% of the gross domestic product...inflated by the helium of artificially depressed interest rates.
 A financialized economy demands perpetually expanding credit – that is, debt – to keep the show going.
 That debt becomes a millstone set upon society's neck. It chokes off savings and investment in productive assets. Speculation goes amok.
 Meantime, wages wallow – and the middling classes with them. The great chasm began to open in the mid-1980s:
 
 Does history reveal parallel examples?
 A finance man named Johnston – Henry Johnston – stretched the historical canvas upon his work desk. He gave it a good looking-over.
 His conclusion:
 ""An examination of history reveals recurrent instances of financialization that bear remarkable similarities, which invites the conclusion that perhaps the predicament in the American economy in recent decades is not unique and that the ever-rising power of Wall Street was in a sense preordained.
 ""It is in this context that it pays to revisit the work of the Italian political economist and historian of global capitalism Giovanni Arrighi (1937-2009)...[He] explored the origins and evolution of capitalist systems dating back to the Renaissance and showed how recurrent phases of financial expansion and collapse underpin broader geopolitical reconfigurations.
 ""Occupying a central place in his theory is the notion that the cycle of rise and fall of each successive hegemon terminates in a crisis of financialization. It is this phase of financialization that facilitates the shift to the next hegemon.""
 The United States is the contemporary hegemon.
 It has constructed a global order that in theory butters the world's bread – but in reality butters its own parsnips:
 ""Observers of the current American hegemony will recognize the transformation of the global system to suit American interests. The maintenance of an ideologically charged ""rules-based"" order – ostensibly for the benefit of everyone – fits neatly into the category of conflation of national and international interests...
 ""The period of ascendency is based on an expansion of trade and production. But this phase eventually reaches maturity, at which point it becomes more difficult to profitably reinvest capital in further expansion.
 ""In other words, the economic endeavors that propelled the rising power to its perch become increasingly less profitable as competition intensifies and, in many cases, much of the real economy is lost to the periphery, where wages are lower. Rising administrative expenses and the cost of maintaining an ever-expanding military also contribute to this.""
 Only a dull, dull blade could fail to notice the American condition in these words.
 What is this ""signal crisis"" Mr.Johnston?
 ""What Arrighi calls a 'signal crisis' [means] an economic crisis that signals the shift from accumulation by material expansion to accumulation by financial expansion. What ensues is a phase characterized by financial intermediation and speculation.
 ""Another way to think about this is that having lost the actual basis for its economic prosperity, a nation turns to finance as the final economic field in which hegemony can be sustained. The phase of financialization is thus characterized by an exaggerated emphasis on financial markets and the finance sector.""
 Yet the transformation from productive phase to financialized phase is temporarily gorgeous.
 It attains – in fact – the appearance of an economic renaissance.
 It is mistaken for the triumphant phoenix, rising gloriously from flames.
 Johnston:
 ""The corrosive nature of financialization is not immediately evident – in fact, quite the opposite. Arrighi demonstrates how the turn to financialization, which is initially quite lucrative, can provide a temporary and illusory respite from the trajectory of decline, thus deferring the onset of the terminal crisis.
 ""For example, the incumbent hegemon at the time, Great Britain, was the country hardest hit by the so-called Long Depression of 1873-1896, a prolonged period of malaise that saw Britain's industrial growth decelerate and its economic standing diminished. Arrighi identifies this as the 'signal crisis' – the point in the cycle where productive vigor is lost and financialization sets in.
 ""[And yet] as Arrighi quotes David Landes' 1969 book The Unbound Prometheus, 'as if by magic, the wheel turned.' In the last years of the century, business suddenly improved and profits rose. 'Confidence returned – not the spotty, evanescent confidence of the brief booms that had punctuated the gloom of the preceding decades, but a general euphoria such as had not prevailed since...the early 1870s.'
 ""In all of Western Europe, these years live on in memory as the good old days – the Edwardian era, la belle epoque.""
 Industrial supremacy yielded to the gimcrack, cheapjack and ruin-racked deceptions of financialization.
 All was illusion. Meantime:
 ""As surplus capital moved out of trade and production, British real wages began a decline starting after the mid-1890s – a reversal of the trend of the past five decades.""
 The following image reveals that the bottom 90% of American earners advanced steadily from the early 1940s through the early 1970s.
 It further reveals that the tiptop 1% of earners lost ground to the bottom 90% across the same stretch.
 Yet in the early 1980s the tiptop 1% went leaping ahead...and began showing society their dust:
 
 As with British labor in the 1870s...so with American labor since the 1980s...both unfortunates of financialization.
 ""Essentially,"" Johnston continues...
 ""...by embracing financialization, Britain played the last card it had to stave off its imperial decline. Beyond that lay the ruin of World War I and the subsequent instability of the interwar period, a manifestation of what Arrighi calls 'systemic chaos' – a phenomenon that becomes particularly visible during signal crises and terminal crises.""
 As Great Britain seized hold of financialization to brace its eroding imperial pillars, so the United States has seized hold of financialization to brace its eroding imperial pillars:
 ""The process of financialization emerging from a signal crisis was repeated with startling similarities in the case of Britain's successor, the US The 1970s was a decade of deep crisis for the US, with high levels of inflation, a weakening Dollar after the 1971 abandonment of gold convertibility and, perhaps most importantly, a loss of competitiveness of US manufacturing.
 ""With rising powers such as Germany, Japan and, later, China able to outcompete it in terms of production, the US reached the same tipping point and, like its predecessors, it turned to financialization. The 1970s was, in the words of historian Judith Stein, the 'pivotal decade' that ""sealed a society-wide transition from industry to finance, factory floor to trading floor.""
 And as Great Britain's 19th-century financialization yielded a brilliant yet false prosperity, America's 20th- and 21st-century financialization has worked the identical effects:
 ""This, Arrighi explains, allowed the US to attract massive amounts of capital and move toward a model of deficit financing – an increasing indebtedness of the US economy and state to the rest of the world.
 ""But financialization also allowed the US to reflate its economic and political power in the world, particularly as the Dollar was ensconced as the global reserve currency. This reprieve gave the US the illusion of prosperity of the late 1980s and '90s, when, as Arrighi says 'there was this idea that the United States had come back'.""
 Had the United States truly come back? Or did it simply enjoy a temporary and illusory bounce – a mere feint?
 ""Financialization merely stalls the inevitable and this has only been laid bare by subsequent events in the US By the late 1990s, the financialization itself was beginning to malfunction, starting with the Asia crisis of 1997 and subsequent popping of the dot-com bubble, and continuing with a reduction in interest rates that would inflate the housing bubble that detonated so spectacularly in 2008.
 ""Since then, the cascade of imbalances in the financial system has only accelerated and it has only been through a combination of increasingly desperate financial legerdemain – inflating one bubble after another – and outright coercion that has allowed the US to extend its hegemony even a bit longer beyond its time.""
 Johnston concludes with a piece co-authored by Arrighi and scholar Beverly Silver:
 ""The expansion can be expected to be a temporary phenomenon that will end more or less catastrophically...But the blindness that led the ruling groups of [hegemonic states of the past] to mistake the 'autumn' for a new 'spring' of their power meant that the end came sooner and more catastrophically than it might otherwise have...A similar blindness is evident today.""
 A similar blindness is indeed evident today. A fellow need be blind to be blinded from the blindness. And only the blind cannot see that all of Washington is blind."

""AT THIS POINT we know almost nothing,"" said one pundit on the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter following Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend, 
            writes Adrian Ash in this note first sent to Weekly Update
             readers on Tuesday.


              
           

             ""Yet we have some certainties. On Monday, 
            oil and gas prices will skyrocket.""
           

              
           

             But no. You were right the first time: No one knows anything...
           

              
           

             ...and rather than regaining late-Friday's $100 plunge and setting new all-time highs above $2400, the gold price failed to jump as Asia and then Europe opened the new week.
           

              
           

             Oil also failed to jump, falling back below $90 per barrel of Brent crude having surged by more than 1/5th so far this year.
           

              
           

             But knowing little-to-nothing about the present, never mind the future, rarely stops anyone pretending otherwise.
           

              
           

             Cue bank and brokerage analysts to revise their gold price forecasts frantically higher...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...some far better informed, careful and more thoughtful than others.
           

              
           

$2200 full-year average in 2024 says Swiss bullion refiner and finance group MKS Pamp, raising its ""mildly bullish original forecast"" of $2050 by 7% to ""outright bullish"" at $2200 because Western central banks seem ""willing to accept higher for longer inflation amidst solid physical demand"" for gold.
           

              
           

$2500 in the 2nd half of 2024 says US financial giant Citi, banking on the Federal Reserve kick-starting rate cuts across the West (and a jump in gold worldwide) this summer, something which 
            Monday's surprise jump in US retail sales data appears to 
            have killed.
           

              
           

$2700 by year-end says US investment bank Goldman Sachs, blaming ""fear"" of financial and monetary chaos for its new gold forecast. So why stop there?
           

              
           

$3000 in 2024 says Bank of America, pointing to ""central banks, Chinese investors, and a growing number of Western buyers."" The first 2 groups are well known if you read these Updates and GoldNews. More on the 3rd group in a moment.
           

              
           

$4000 in 2-3 years says Swiss bank UBS, looking at 3 previous jumps in the gold price and saying that ""if history repeats, it's not too late to participate.""
           

              
           

             Given that I know nothing, I'll back that $4000 forecast from UBS, not least on its timeline of ""sometime in the future"".
           

              
           

             But the word ""if"" is doing a lot of work in that projection. Because history does not repeat. It can't.
           

              
           

             Things that have already happened have already happened. No set of circumstances can ever return, most surely not in its entirety. And while history might rhyme, the refrain is likely to be brief, if not a descant.
           

              
           

             So what echoes can we hear today? Let's strain our ears and listen in...
           

              
           

May 2006: Gold surges 28% inside 7 weeks, hitting $730 per Troy ounce, the highest since the all-time highs of New Year 1980. Pundits point to firm oil prices and a falling Dollar. Yet interest rates in the bond market (against which gold tends to move inversely) are actually rising, and gold in UK Pounds sets a new all-time high above £380.
           

              
           

Echo? Like this jump so far, no one really knows what drove gold's 2006 spike. All the usual gold models and correlations fail to make sense.


              
           

August 2011: Western economies hit the end of the world and their financial crisis peaks with England's worst rioting since the 18th Century, the USA's credit rating getting cut from triple-A, and debt-torn Greece risking social collapse across the Eurozone. Fear and panic grip investors, government and the media. Gold surges to $1900, up by 1/5th from 6 weeks before.
           

              
           

Echo? Sundays are typically quiet on BullionVault, but the Order Board remains open, ready for you to trade. And last weekend, here in April 2024, saw the heaviest Sunday demand for gold, net of customer selling, since 7 August 2011.


              
           

Spring 2013: Having risen almost non-stop since the start of the Millennium, gold hits the biggest price crash of modern times as the financial markets decide that the banking crisis is over. The crash cuts $1 trillion off the value of all the gold ever mined in history in just 2 days, and it cuts the price by 25% in 3 months. 
           

              
           

Echo? Western investors should have sent a big 'Thank you' letter to Chinese households a decade ago for stepping in to buy the metal they no longer wanted. Now China has been hoovering up gold as Western investors sell once again. Only this time, the price has risen 17% inside 3 months instead of losing a quarter.


              
           

             Put it all together, and...as you can see...there really isn't any precedent for gold to behave like it's been moving this spring.
           

              
           

             Some aspects echo a bull market spike and top. Other aspects echo the precious metal's worst ever sell off. But that's only because that huge sell-off by Western investors spurred huge buying by price-wise Chinese households. Whereas the tables have turned entirely in 2024 to date...
           

              
           

             ...alongside an awful war in the Middle East, ongoing slaughter in Ukraine, a rebound in commodity-price inflation, record and ever-mounting Western government debts, a breakdown in US political dominance worldwide, plus repeated expectations for Western central banks to start cutting interest rates.
           

              
           

             What happens next? No one can know.
           

              
           

             So here instead is a photo of tulips in bloom, plus one (a 
            Semper Augustus maybe?) already past its best.
           

              
           




              
           

             These snaps come from outside the BullionVault office.
           

              
           

             The contract gardeners do a wonderful job...
           

              
           

             ...ensuring a little loveliness in well-kept beds and boxes amid the concrete and asphalt of Hammersmith, West London.
           

              
           

             Each spring, there's always a great show of tulips, that beautiful 
            memento mori for any investor enjoying a bull market.
           

              
           

             No doubt you know about 
            the 'Tulip Mania' of 17th Century Holland. You might know that 
            it's something of a myth too. But true or not, the lessons are plain.
           

              
           

 No bull market lasts forever;
 Speculation jumps when the fundamentals run out;
 There are no prizes for being the last person to buy or bet on more gains.


             Is that where gold sits today? Past its best, and about to drop its petals?
           

              
           

             First, last Friday's huge spike through $2400 clearly marked a blow-off top for gold short term. But while 
            gold briefly rediscovered gravity on Monday's strong US retail sales data, the bullion market then rebounded, suggesting that the date of the Fed's first rate cut matters far less than the return of inflation or the geopolitical drivers.
           

              
           

             Second, what started as a jump on central-bank buying and then China's massive household investment became all about the Middle East last week, with speculation in Shanghai and London derivatives sending the gold price 5% higher with another run of new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Short term it looks like that boil has been lanced. The US and the UN are pleading for de-escalation, and Tehran itself says the matter is 'concluded for now'. But while that has left gold without new speculation to recover last Friday's spike through $2400, the baseline remains strong geopolitical stockpiling plus continued investment-insurance demand from China's private sector.
           

              
           

             More clearly, the level of speculation through US Comex futures and options remains way below anything screaming 'Tulip!'...
           

              
           

             ...last 
            Friday's spike in gold options volume notwithstanding.
           

              
           




              
           

             Indeed, the net speculative position of hedge funds and other 'Managed Money' players was virtually unchanged in the 7 days ending Tuesday last week (currently the latest data available)...
           

              
           

             ...and it actually fell as a proportion of all Comex gold derivatives contracts now open...
           

              
           

             ...down to 20.7% from the prior week's 4-year high of 22.3%.
           

              
           

             That's barely in the top one-third of most over-excited weeks since the current data began in mid-2006, and it's well below the 2009 or 2016 peaks of net spec longs running above 30% of Open Interest on regulator the CFTC's data.
           

              
           

             Third, and most notably, this pullback is finding strong buying among Western investors, extending the upturn we've already seen so far this month.
           

              
           

             April has marked the strongest month-to-date since March 2022 for first-time precious metals investors on BullionVault. Last week saw positive net demand for gold on our trading exchange for the first week in 13.
           

              
           

             A gold rush at last? Not quite.
           

              
           

             This straw in the wind marks a turnaround from the record-heavy profit-taking of 2024 to date. That selling, for a profit, has made this run of record gold prices very different from any bull market I've ever seen before. Because, without wishing to be rude dear reader, investment manias don't peak with private investors sitting it out, taking profits, or merely tip-toeing in.
           

              
           

             None of this is to say gold can't and won't drop and keep dropping from here. No one can see the future, and no one I know has yet figured out exactly what or who has been driving this surge in gold prices anyway.
           

              
           

             But since the price kicked higher at the start of March, this surge remains modest compared to gold's monster blow-offs across the past 60 years, trailing the 13 biggest moves on a percentage basis despite 
            setting record runs of new record gold prices.
           

              
           

             This steady if not stealthy move is, in a word, unique. Peace and love meantime show no sign of breaking out soon. Western stock markets have begun slipping. Western investors remain much lighter in gold than they were only at the start of the year, never mind 12 months before.
           

              
           

             What happens when that starts to turn around? Which maybe it has?
           

              
           

             As for the 3 echoes of a distant time we heard above, the 2013 crash so loved by Chinese consumers proved only a way-station on the road to gold almost halving by the end of 2015 from its 2011 top...
           

              
           

             ...a peak which itself had gone as fast as it came in that hectic summer of debt downgrades and riots, and which then stayed unbeaten until the Covid catastrophe of summer 2020.
           

              
           

             As for gold in spring 2006...the sudden pop no one could explain...gold gave back all of those 6-week gains within 6 weeks as well. It wouldn't beat that top for more than a year...
           

              
           

             ...not until the global credit crunch took down UK mortgage lender Northern Rock, marking the start of the global financial crisis.
           

              
           

             The ultimate high in that decade-long move then came 4 years later again, some 160% higher."
2024-04-18,"Title:Why Do the Heaviest Borrowers Dominate Bond Funds?
Article:Bigger the borrower, bigger the weighting...

 BOND FUND managers may soon become the definitive and doleful examplar of economic agents, with all the attendant risks for their investors, writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.
 It's unlikely, for example, that your typical bond fund manager has much, if any, of his personal wealth tied up in his fund. By dint of being price-insensitive, he will manage his fund not in the best interests of capital preservation for his investors, but with the highest likelihood of matching or outperforming his benchmark.
 Unfortunately for his investors, his benchmark isn't fit for purpose. Like most equity benchmarks, it is a function of market size, as opposed to quality. In other words, the institutional bond fund world legitimises sovereign borrowers with specific reference to their level of indebtedness: the more indebted the country, the larger the capitalisation of its bond market, and therefore the more significant that country is within the bond market universe.
 The largest components within the global bond benchmarks are the most heavily indebted issuers – be they countries or companies. All things equal, the most heavily indebted issuers are most likely to be debtors, not creditors. But if you want to lend your money to somebody (which is what buying their bonds amounts to), it only makes sense to lend your money to someone who is capable of paying you back.
 Bond benchmarking forces bond fund managers to allocate their investors' capital to some of the very worst credit risks. Bond fund managers pursuing inappropriate benchmarks are pouring money into increasingly expensive sovereign bond markets that at some point will trigger huge losses for their investors as interest rates rise beyond the capacity of issuing governments to service their debts. Bond fund managers are not risking their own capital, so they will continue to try and meet the narrow demands of their institutional mandates.
 On any rational analysis, this is an absurd state of affairs. Beyond a certain point, which even the dubiously creditworthy US may now have reached (see Chart 1 below), a vastly indebted country can enjoy a formal AAA or AA credit rating, and sit proudly atop an index ranking bond market size, and yet represent a significant risk to (private) investors' capital. If there were ever a time to be concerned about the prospect of capital loss in G7 government bond markets – whether via serious price degradation consistent with rising market interest rates or, ultimately, via terminal default or inflationary repudiation – now is that time.
 The debt to GDP metric as an assessment of sovereign bond quality is not appropriate. A far superior way of assessing sovereign creditworthiness is to use a metric known as net foreign assets to GDP.
 For any country with control over its printing press, servicing debt obligations issued in its domestic currency is easy: in extremis, if it experiences a shortfall between revenues and expenditures, it can simply print more money in order to make those interest or principal repayments.
 But whenever countries get into difficulty (by over-borrowing) in the bond markets, it is invariably the foreign borrowings that cause the problems. Take the UK.
 His Majesty's Government will never have any trouble servicing its sterling denominated debts – the government can effectively print more money, indefinitely, to pay them. But the UK government has also borrowed money in foreign currencies, such as the US Dollar. The UK government cannot legally print US Dollars, so it's critically important that the UK maintains foreign assets as well as purely domestic (sterling denominated) ones whereby it can service its debts. Which is where the net foreign assets metric is useful.
 Net foreign assets comprise the totality of government sector, corporate sector and household assets. A country with surplus net foreign assets is a genuine creditor country. A country with only net foreign liabilities is a debtor. Chart I shows, as at 2023, where various countries sat on the spectrum of net foreign assets to GDP.
 
 The countries on the left of the chart – the likes of the UAE, Norway, Qatar and Singapore – are all objectively wealthy.
 They are creditor countries with meaningful surplus foreign assets. They are highly unlikely to default. Their bonds are objectively creditworthy. The same cannot be said for the countries on the right hand side of the chart. They are debtor countries without any meaningful foreign assets – only liabilities. In extremis, they run the risk of default. Indeed some of them already have.
 We can even treat this chart as something like a prospective road map for future sovereign defaults. Looking at the worst culprits (those countries furthest to the right on the chart), previous ultra-low scorers like Iceland have already defaulted. Who might be next? Using the net foreign assets metric as a guide, and assuming that the EU somehow manages to bail out (more likely bail in) the afflicted, it could be, erm, the United States itself.
 Endgame?
 As anyone who has ever worked in a bond dealing room can testify, the bond market is ordinarily an oasis of sobriety compared to the manic meanderings of equities. Not for the bond salesman the hot tip or the alluring nugget of inside information of dubious provenance. The bond market is powered by a coolly dispassionate macro engine. It is driven by rational analysis of currencies, interest rates and inflation.
 Unlike a giddy and easily rattled stock market, a sober and reasoned bond market can also exert powerful leverage over politicians. As US Democrat adviser James Carville once said: ""I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the Pope or a .400 baseball hitter...but now I want to come back as the bond market.
 ""You can intimidate everybody.""
 And for the past 40 years and more, until very recently, the bond market's trajectory has been: effortlessly higher. Bond prices have soared; their yields have collapsed. US long bond yields, which stood at 15% in 1981, have been grinding relentlessly lower, as a combination of central bank policy and benign trends in globalisation that have succeeded in bewitching the gods of inflation. Perhaps most notoriously, Japanese government bond yields fell all the way from 8% in the early 1990s to below 0%, as a genuine deflation and a banking and property crisis worked their magic on bond prices.
 Where, asks the bond market agnostic, is the influence of supply and demand upon bond prices? This is a good question, and more than usually pertinent given that we may be at something of an inflection point in the evolution of the market. In a remarkable confluence of events that looks almost like conspiracy to the outsider, G7 bond prices rallied over the course of more than two decades even as the supply of those same government bonds shot through the roof. A combination of rising prices and rising supply looks a little too much like financial alchemy.
 What makes the near-term outlook so exquisitely uncertain is that bond markets and stock markets do not trade in isolation. At a time of heightened (equity) market volatility, what would under normal market conditions constitute a waltz of mutual interest between stocks and bonds disintegrates into a cold war stand-off of mutual distrust, with each market trading off and anticipating weakness or recovery in the other. This sort of nervous reflexivity makes for lousy longer-term asset price forecasting.
 Further global tightening of monetary policy must occur at some point. It will impose an inevitable drag on the performance of risk assets. Ongoing repositioning and risk reduction from sometimes leveraged financial institutions will exacerbate the amplitude of market declines.
 Albert Edwards of SocGen deserves some credit for maintaining his Ice Age thesis over a sustained period of widespread scepticism from other market participants. He summarises it as follows:
 ""First, that the West would drift ever closer to outright deflation, following Japan's template a decade earlier. And second, financial markets would adjust in the same way as in Japan. Government bonds would re-rate in absolute and relative terms compared to equities, which would also de-rate in absolute terms.
 ""Another associated element of the Ice Age we also saw in Japan is that with each cyclical upturn, equity investors have assumed with child-like innocence that central banks have somehow 'fixed' the problem and we were back in a self-sustaining recovery. These hopes would only be crushed as the next cyclical downturn took inflation, bond yields and equity valuations to new destructive lows. In the Ice Age, hope is the biggest enemy.
 ""Investors are beginning to see how impotent the Fed and ECB's efforts are to prevent deflation. And as the scales lift from their eyes, equity, credit and other risk assets trading at extraordinarily high valuations will take their next Ice Age stride towards the final denouement.""
 Several high-profile reports have recently been published drawing attention to the debt problems gnawing away at the economic vitality of the West. Perhaps the most damning response to date came from the Euro zone's all-time pre-eminent political cynic, Jean-Claude Juncker:
 ""We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it.""
 This may be the most dangerous market environment in history. Investors have placed a lot of faith in the ability of central banks to avoid disaster – to suppress market interest rates and bond yields, and to support equity prices. But as the Swiss National Bank showed in January 2015 when it removed the Swiss Franc's peg to the Euro, central banks cannot always be trusted. Investors – both in stocks and in bonds – are effectively playing chicken with the central banks, surfing a tidal wave of liquidity on the expectation that this liquidity, an ocean of easy money, will never drain away. Who will blink first: markets or central banks?
 The financial markets are awkwardly polarised between fears of profound debt deflation and fears of uncomfortable monetary inflation. On the basis that generals are invariably transfixed by the last war, it might be fair to suggest that Americans are determined never again to experience the debt deflation of the 1930s. Given the role and extent of government indebtedness throughout the modern world, a debt deflation is a practically unthinkable outcome. But just because something is deeply undesirable does not make it impossible. In their eagerness to pump money into the system to make up for the credit contraction caused by an ailing banking system, the politicians of today may be setting themselves up for the last financial war painfully recalled by German monetary officials, namely the Weimar hyperinflation.
 If officials don't deliberately design or ignite an inflation, it may come about in any case via the foreign exchange markets, or a surge in government bond yields. As Jens Parsson indicates in his study Dying of Money:
 ""The spectre that waits in the wings of any inflation, including the American, is the general exodus of the people from the currency when they lose faith in it at last. When this spectre steps in from the wings, the government's games are over and the final curtain is not far away.""
 The practical response to overvaluation in the bond market?
 If you do not need to own bonds, then don't. And if you are obligated to hold bond investments for some reason, then focus solely on high-quality bonds issued by creditor countries or issuers as opposed to debtors.
 Central banks may have succeeded in supporting bond prices, and suppressing bond yields, by way of outrageous price manipulation, but history suggests they will not be able to do so forever. At some point, the market will have its say. Its response is likely to be unprintable for the holders of most forms of government debt.
 In the meantime, superior investment choices exist. Investors requiring any combination of income and capital growth will almost certainly be better off purchasing the shares of high-quality businesses at fair valuations instead. We see especial merit in the shares of commodity companies at fair valuations – which most of them now possess. Within that market we see especial merit in the shares of profitable gold and silver miners, because at some point a debt disaster now seems possible – the sort of disaster which could even afflict the monstrously indebted US government.
 Chart 2, courtesy of the Bank of England, shows just how low both short and long-term interest rates are, covering a period of 5000 years.
 
 (For data prior to the 18th century, the Bank has used interest rates reflecting the country with the lowest interest rate reported for various types of credit. From 3,000 BC to the 6th century BC these rates come from the Babylonian Empire. From the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC they come from Greece. From the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD they are drawn from the Roman Empire. Subsequent data come from regions including the Netherlands and Italy.)
 And those rates haven't realistically been lower in 5,000 years. For anyone alive during that 1970s inflationary spike in interest rates, the interest rate game has clearly changed profoundly within their own lifetimes. An observation in passing: during the 2000-2011 commodity rally, the price of gold went up by 7 times. During the 1970s, the price of gold went up by 20 times. Is today's environment comparable to that of the 1970s? In debt terms alone, it is objectively worse.
 Although the timing is not clear, at some point interest rates, we think, must rise further – unless our central banks can keep them artificially suppressed indefinitely. In the event that interest rates rise from current levels – and in a somewhat uncontrolled, involuntary way – the damage to bond markets (and fiat currencies) could be spectacular.

Article:What ChatGPT has done to Google searches for 'crypto'...

 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and Bitcoin were top of mind at last week's Paris Blockchain Week, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 I had the privilege of presenting to an enthusiastic crowd. The blockchain and digital assets event, held beneath the world-famous Louvre Museum, attracted close to 10,000 people, an impressive 25% increase over last year, as Bitcoin traded near its all-time high and AI dominated headlines.
 To give you an idea of just how explosive AI has been in the public consciousness, especially since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, consider this chart. It compares Google searches for ""AI"" and ""Bitcoin"".
 
 Post-ChatGPT, people's interest in learning more about AI has gone parabolic.
 My presentation focused on the transformative potential of Bitcoin and AI through the lens of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory, highlighting how these nascent technologies are already reshaping our world in profound ways.
 By exploring some of the key features of CAS – including decentralization, network effects and nonlinear dynamics – I sought to show how Bitcoin and AI are prime examples of complex systems whose influence on our lives will only continue to grow.
 Ultimately, my goal was to leave attendees with a renewed sense of excitement and optimism for AI and Bitcoin. I genuinely believe that, if done right, these technologies can help us build a future that's more opportunistic, fair and sustainable.
 A good example of what I'm talking about are smart contracts. These self-executing applications, which are still in their infancy, have the potential to streamline complex transactions, increase efficiency and reduce costs.
 Doug Levin, serial entrepreneur and Executive-in-Residence at Harvard Business School, laid out the perfect use case for smart contracts in the oil industry. According to Levin, these contracts could incorporate different transactions occurring automatically at different prices, based on varying market conditions. This has the power to create a fairer, more efficient and transparent marketplace for both oil buyers and sellers.
 The efficiency of blockchain transactions is already evident. A few years ago, everyone was astonished to learn that a $1 billion transaction between two anonymous Bitcoin wallets settled in under an hour with a fee of only $700. Meanwhile, moving money from a New York bank to a Paris bank can still take up to a week to fully settle.
 Looking further into the future, Ryan Condron, creator of the Lumerin protocol, shared his thought-provoking vision of the world where everyone has their own personalized AI that knows everything about them, from childhood to, well, the very end. Theoretically, this AI could continue to make investment decisions and deploy capital on that person's behalf, even after they were gone, based on their preferences and the AI's deep understanding of who they were during their lifetime.
 With AI, paired with Bitcoin, maybe you'll be able to take it with you after all.
 In case you missed it, Elon Musk made a bold yet plausible prediction last week regarding AI, saying he believes the technology will become ""smarter than the smartest human"" by next year or 2026 at the latest. I don't know who the smartest human currently living is, but if (and when) this happens, we may need to redefine what it means to be ""smart"".
 The Tesla chief's forecast might not come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention. For months now, AI has been able to pass a number of rigorous human tests, including the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE). In February, a team of researchers reported that the most recent version of ChatGPT exhibits characteristics that are ""statistically indistinguishable from a random human."" Way before that, in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
 Another highly influential business leader, J.P.Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, also weighed in on AI last week. In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon speculated that the technology has the potential to be ""as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years,"" citing examples such as the printing press and the internet.
 I agree whole-heartedly with Dimon on this point, even if I don't agree with his negative views on Bitcoin. The world's largest digital asset poses a serious challenge to his business, and it's easy to imagine that Dimon, as CEO of the world's largest bank, sees his role as protector of centralized finance, fiat currency, and the traditional banking system.
 Interestingly, Dimon raises a number of major risks in his letter – from record-high government debt to political polarization to escalating global tensions – that could also double as reasons to own an uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin.
 As one Bitcoin-related X account quipped, ""Jamie Dimon is a #Bitcoin salesman and doesn't even know it.""
 From smart contracts that streamline complex transactions to personalized AI assistants that can make decisions on our behalf, the possibilities of AI are endless. And with the added security and decentralization provided by Bitcoin, we may be on the cusp of a new era of financial freedom and innovation.
 There's a lot of doom and gloom surrounding Bitcoin and AI, but I choose to approach them with a sense of optimism, and I hope you choose to do so as well."

Article:Volatility and FOMO guaranteed...

 GOLD is once again dashing to new all-time highs, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Investors are finally starting to notice what we've been talking about for months: A new bull run for precious metals is upon us. And if you pay close attention, you have the opportunity to ride the early rallies as gold, silver, and other metals take the market by storm.
 We've closely followed gold's breakout potential since late last year when the yellow metal finally posted its first monthly close above $2000 – and subsequently took its sweet time consolidating before extending this breakout move in early March.
 But most market watchers haven't paid close attention to precious metals. In fact, up until just a few weeks ago, you would've been hard-pressed to find any talking heads mentioning gold on the financial news networks. Too many other distractions clogged the airwaves, from Magnificent Seven stock stories to the amazing parabolic rallies sprinkled throughout the popular semiconductor names.
 Fast forward to this week and you'll notice that the semis have gone nowhere since early March – right about the same time a spark was lit under precious metals.
 Now, we're seeing the first signs of mainstream investors and analysts buying into the new golden bull.
 Precious metals are getting their due on the financial news as strong rallies lift gold to gains every week. Silver is also snapping back following months of ugly underperformance. Platinum and palladium are catching bids. Base metals like copper are extending their respective breakout moves. Everywhere we look, we're finding bullish charts.
 So it's no surprise to see the big boys adjusting their year-end price targets.
 Goldman Sachs is the latest firm to grab the tail of the stampeding gold bull. It just lifted its year-end price target on gold to $2700 after spot prices hit a [then] new record high above $2370, calling the new gold bull unshakable.
 ""Despite the market pricing progressively fewer Fed cuts, stronger growth trends and record equity markets, gold has rallied 20% over the past two months,"" reads the note, via Investing.com. ""The traditional fair value of gold would connect the usual catalysts – real rates, growth expectations and the Dollar – to flows and the price. None of those traditional factors adequately explain the velocity and scale of the gold price move so far this year.""
 You might be tempted to dunk on the folks at Goldman for being late to the party when it comes to the precious metals rally. But I think it's silly to take these ""target adjustments"" seriously.
 First of all, these ideas are for the media and the public's consumption. I do not believe it reflects the firm's investment strategy. We don't know what they're buying or selling at any given moment, but I seriously doubt they're following these targets as their primary research.
 Next, it's important to understand that this is how the game is played. Any analyst target is a moving goalpost. If gold were to crater back below $2000 (which I don't think will happen) another updated target would magically appear that fits with the new trend.
 Now, the main bone I have to pick with the fresh Goldman target is how it claims that this new gold rally is unshakable- because it would not surprise me to see more shakeouts and intraday volatility as new traders and investors pile into metals and miners.
 We're already seeing just that.
 Remember, gold's decade-long bear market forced just about everyone out of the metals trades until recently. Gold mining stocks, for example, have been dead money for years. No one wanted to own these names when gold was going nowhere.
 Naturally, these trades are beginning to come back to life as gold futures extend their historic breakout. As the FOMO brews, we're starting to see some volatile sessions stack up in futures and precious metals stocks.
 Again, we haven't seen this type of high-volume chasing in these stocks until recently because no one wanted to be involved in these trades. I still believe we're in the early innings of a bigger, secular metals rally. But it won't move higher in a straight line. The branches of these trees will shake – sometimes violently – as more investors pile in.
 A major component of any sound trading plan involves understanding the current market environment.
 Over the past several weeks, we've discussed how traders can capitalize on shorter-term moves in gold via the futures market, mining stocks, or gold funds as the environment improves throughout the sector. This also means that we have the opportunity to attempt to profit from breakout strategies as individual mining stocks heat up.
 Knowing your desired time frame is critical when attempting to place your buys and sells as the gold trade heats up. It might seem obvious that longer-term-minded investors will be best served if they patiently buy dips, while shorter-term traders can attempt to ride momentum moves and breakouts. Yet it's important to remember to have your time frame in mind and execute your plan accordingly.
 It's all too easy to tear up your plans and just close your eyes and buy when you see your desired stock or ETF explode higher. Panic buying is real – and can be dangerous!
 As for price targets, don't get too caught up in being right or hitting a magical level like gold $2700 by the end of December. For the record, I tossed out a $2600 target way back in mid-December 2023. It's a decent roadmap. But we'll need to hone in and adjust the route along the way.
 We're already witnessing some wild action in precious metals and stocks as the tensions between Iran and Israel evolve. Don't be afraid to take a step back from the charts as additional volatility barges into the markets."

Article:An overbought market is a bullish market...

 NFTRH is a top-down macro entity, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole, posting this just before gold's late-Friday surge and then drop from $2400.
 It is not a stock pick rag, a technical analysis junkie, a market psychologist or a monetary/fiscal policy obsessive. It is all of those things, as needed. But primarily what we do is define the macro and then continually update the definition because it is always progressing, shifting, cycling and changing.
 From that work we then try to take it from 'top-down' definition and apply it to investment strategies.
 I sometimes bristle at the hype that emanates from the precious metals sphere coming in the form of gold bug doctrine, perma-cheerleading, lecturing and rigid thinking. That is because – like it or not – the macro is always shifting and, doctrine or not, the macro shifted away from the precious metals in 2012 and only began recovering a gold-positive view in 2018.
 Since then it's been a volatile process with incomplete macro fundamentals. Incomplete, but now turning to the preferred macro that a gold bull would want to see and a stock bull would not want to see.
 Let's be clear, ""turning"" is not ""turned"". It is not complete, but our view of transition is being proven out slowly and now, methodically. I still have a personal question as to whether the forces of bubble-making (now in their 3rd decade by my estimation) can hold 'er together to and through the presidential election.
 But we don't need to have the answer to that question. We need to manage risk and respect market signals and TA.
 Here is the thing; gold to me is an indicator as much as it is a monetary value retainer and risk manager. I disregard views of gold as some kind of play; as a market among other markets.
 Gold miners are a play; a play on the asset that stands outside of the Keynesian debt/leverage system as the anti-bubble. When anti-bubble forces become too strong and the 'bust' end of the boom/bust cycle ensues, the gold miners should leverage the relative performance of gold to speculative upside based on positive leverage, just as they have chronically under-performed due to negative leverage during intense bubble phases.
 Getting off the idealist views and back to the technical view, gold's weekly chart is purely bullish. The pattern of this chart targets 2450. This is a purely bullish breakout to blue sky.
 
 The monthly chart advises the target of the large Cup and Handle, which has been fashioned over 10 years of pain and pleasure. The max pleasure point had been the 2020 high, from which the Cup made its higher right side high. After that, the smaller pattern did its thing.
 You see weekly and monthly RSI flirting with overbought status (as is the daily), but let's discuss this for a moment.
 Traders will watch that stuff. But investors should realize how long gold stayed overbought during the hard up phases of the previous bull market (2005-2011) and the first up phase of this bull market (2019-2020). I've shaded those instances.
 The thing is, an overbought market is a sign of a bullish market. I, who have held the metal since 2002, would not trade it (unlike the miners). But traders would do whatever the hell they will with GLD and other bullion holders/price trackers.
 
 As we've been noting for months now, gold is bullish on all time frames, with the daily finally joining the weekly and monthly in that status back in Q4, 2023.
 There will be breathtaking ups and gut wrenching downs. But a turn in the macro will put a relative tailwind to the ups for counter-cyclical gold in the coming years. It will require a balanced view with ongoing perspective review."

Article:210 reasons for the fall of Rome...

 FEW THINGS in recorded history have triggered more curiosity on the part of subsequent generations than the collapse of the Roman Empire, says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 Bryan Ward-Perkins in 'The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilisation' lists no fewer than 210 concepts that have been suggested by historians to account for it. His own thesis – to which we are highly sympathetic – is that fiscal decline collided with an over-stretched army which led in turn to civil wars, a doom spiral of withering resources, and ultimately to defeat by 'barbarians', leading to a catastrophic final civilisational collapse.
 Perhaps someone could buy a copy for the Biden administration.
 The fall of Rome is also one of the many topics discussed in one of the most intriguing books we have ever read, namely Iain McGilchrist's 'The Master and his Emissary'. Antonia Filmer summarises the book as follows:
 ""In a simplistic nutshell Dr.McGilchrist's hypothesis is, apart from its motor functions, each side of the brain has its own specific expertise. The left side absorbs detail, data, statistics (the purely mechanical, rather than creative, side of maths, physics, science), it focuses on categorisation, predictability, systems, and the right side appreciates intangibles, humour, the sound of music, the flow of time, emotion, beauty, subtlety, nuance, language, syntax, expression, virtues, values, judgement, danger, experience and metaphor; proper understanding and imagination requires both hemispheres to work together and share their findings.
 ""Through the corpus callosum the right gives context and meaning to the left. Without both sides operating harmoniously together McGilchrist posits Western society as we know it is at risk. He believes that presently we are in thrall to the left hemisphere which has evolved and exaggerated itself largely eclipsing the right.
 ""McGilchrist explains the right hemisphere has first take on everything, it is attentive and vigilant to the world all around, the left selects and focusses on the details; reason and knowledge are no substitute for wisdom and intuition. Thus, we have an inability to see and understand the whole picture and to make strategies accordingly.
 ""The book title is a metaphor about a powerful master whose appointed emissary is supposed to carry his message across the world, in the absence of the master the emissary becomes deluded, does not recognise the value of the master and thinks he knows it all, and because he did not have the master's big picture, the community began to decline.
 ""McGilchrist examines the rise and downfall of the Greek and Roman Civilisations, and the Renaissance; all three go through a time when the left and right hemispheres are in the proper balance and everything flourishes. Then to maintain control and administer an empire the thinking shifts to the left hemisphere, to the present and to the explicit, it becomes rationalistic, linear and analytical but it cannot interpret or manipulate the information leading to inevitable collapse.""
 McGilchrist recently presented at the Darwin College Lecture Series in Cambridge. His lecture is quite simply one of the most impressive and articulate displays of scholarship we have seen. Over to Dr McGilchrist:
 ""Today I'm going to be talking about the Hemisphere Theory as a way of understanding what we call the meta-crisis, the various groups of problems of considerable severity that bedevil us these days. I believe that by understanding more about how the brain works we can see these disparate elements of the so-called meta-crisis as coherent and in some sense as inevitable consequences of our espousal of a very strange way of thinking about and looking at ourselves and the world to which we belong..
 ""Carved into the stone of the Ancient Temple of Apollo at Deli was the injunction to 'know thyself'. Without such knowledge we are tossed this way and that by forces we neither suspect nor understand. Knowing ourselves helps explain our predicament and doing so is greatly aided by understanding an aspect of the way in which the brain constructs the world. I believe we've adopted a limited vision of a very particular type and precisely because it is limited we cannot see that it is limited. We no longer seem to recognize what it is. We do not know what our way of being in the world is pushing out of our lives and out of our world. To understand what is going on we need a breadth of view that is increasingly rare..
 ""Each hemisphere has evolved for classical Darwinian reasons to pay a different kind of attention to the world. The left hemisphere has evolved to pay 'narrow beam' attention focused on the detail that we already know and desire and are intent on grabbing and getting whether it be something to eat or to use in some other way. In a word the left hemisphere exists in the service of manipulation; the right hemisphere meanwhile is on the lookout for everything else that's going on.. the right hemisphere is in the service of understanding the contextual whole which is nothing less than the world – and context changes everything..
 ""As A.N.Whitehead, one of my intellectual heroes, observed, a culture is in its finest flower before it begins to analyse itself. Once our lives become very largely mediated by self-reflexive language and discourse (as in our postmodern world they are) the explicit stands forward and the implicit retires, yet almost everything that really matters to us – the beauty of nature, poetry, music, art, narrative, drama, myth, ritual, sex, love – the sense of the sacred must remain implicit if we're not to destroy their nature..
 ""The left hemisphere never doubts that it is right. It is never wrong and never at fault; someone else is always to blame. Furthermore, in what I take to be the four important onward paths to truth – science, reason, intuition and imagination – though both hemispheres contribute, the crucial part in each case including in science and reason is played by the right hemisphere not the left. Our predicament is that we now live in a world where the understanding of which is largely limited to that of the inferior left hemisphere.
 ""Some signs of this include our inability to see the broader picture both in space and in time the way in which wisdom has been lost, understanding reduced to mere knowledge, and knowledge replaced by information...[we have also seen] the reduction of justice to mere equality; a loss of the sense of the uniqueness of all things; the supplanting of quality by quantity; the abandonment of nuance in favour of simplistic either/or positions; the loss of reasonableness which is replaced by rationalization; a complete disregard for common sense; the design of systems not for humans but to maximize utility; a growth of paranoia and pervasive mistrust, for if all is not under its control the left hemisphere becomes anxious and protects its anxiety outwards onto others..
 ""In the second part of 'The Master and his Emissary' I track the main turning points in the history of ideas in the West and conclude that three times we have seen enacted a certain pattern: first there is a sudden efflorescence of everything that comes from the proper working together of the two hemispheres in harmony. Then follows a stable period for a few hundred years at most and soon a decline after which the civilization eventually crumbles under its own weight..
 ""Since the Industrial Revolution and particularly in the last 50 years we have created a world around us which in contrast to the natural world reflects the left hemisphere's properties and its vision. What we see around us now looking out of the metaphorical window is rectilinear, man-made, utilitarian...each thing ripped from the context in which it alone has meaning and for many the two-dimensional representations provided by TV screens and computers have come largely to supplant direct face-to-face experience of three-dimensional life in all its complexity..
 ""My worry is not that machines will become like people – an impossibility – but that people are already becoming more like machines.
 ""I believe it is the left hemispheric view of the world intellectually and morally bankrupt as it is that has resulted in what has been called The Meta Crisis: not just the odd crisis here and there but the despoliation of the natural world; the decline of species on a colossal scale.. the destruction of the way of life of indigenous people; the fragmentation and polarization of a once civilized society with escalating not diminishing resentments on all sides; an escalating not diminishing gap between rich and poor; a surge in mental illness, not the promised increase in happiness; a proliferation of laws but a rise in crime; the abandonment of civil discourse; a betrayal of standards in our major institutions – Government, the BBC, the police, our hospitals, schools and universities, once rightly admired all over the world – which have all become vastly overweighted with bureaucracy, inflexible and obsessed with enforcement of a world view that is in flat contradiction to reality and isn't their job to enforce, and the looming menace of totalitarian control through AI..
 ""As so many have predicted since the time of Goethe, we cannot say we were not warned. Even physics now teaches us that the mechanical model of the universe is mistaken but because of our success in making machines we still imagine that the machine is the best model for understanding everything we come across. We ourselves, our brains and minds, our society and the living world are now supposed to be explained by the metaphor of the machine yet only the tiniest handful of things in the entire known universe are at all like a machine – namely the machines we made in the last few hundred years..
 ""We neglect the importance of context. We believe we are right and that one size fits all justifying the imposition of vast global bureaucratic structures not to say wars so as to impose our thinking on cultures far different from our own. Equally we arrogantly critique our ancestors for not sharing the idiosyncratic view of the world we've generated in the last 20 years and which we believe must now be forced on all, whatever their reasonable misgivings; and we treat people not as unique living beings but as exemplars of a category.
 ""One aspect of this is the virtual machine known as bureaucracy. Famously Hannah Ahrendt referred to the ""banality of evil"". One of the most disquieting aspects of the Nazi regime was its chilling bureaucracy. Mind-numbing evil was committed by people who were for the most part not conventional monsters but were simply following the ordained procedures. Real people and real life had been almost wholly obscured by pieces of paper and the recording of numbers.
 ""Once the integrity founded in an intuitive moral sense is lost, a society becomes like a building that has lost its integrity and needs to be shored up with ever more scaffolding. Now there has to be a law for everything, yet crime escalates.
 ""I see widespread evidence of...'sustained incoherence' in corporations; governments; health systems and education – everywhere that management culture holds sway...
 ""One cannot have trust in a society where no one is speaking the truth and one cannot be true to a society where there is no trust. As Confucius told one of his disciples, for a stable Society a ruler needs three things: weapons, food and trust. If he cannot hold all three he should forego weapons first, and food next, for 'without trust we cannot stand'.""
 Without trust we cannot stand. A lesson that some of us learnt during the Global Financial Crisis 16 years ago – and which the rest of the entire western establishment seems to be learning for the first time today."

Article:World No.1 gold-buying nation has hit its 'Lehmans moment'...


              
           


SO the GOLD PRICE has kept setting new all-time highs, 
            says Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             It cost $1985 per Troy ounce in mid-February. Today gold jumped through $2400.
           

              
           

             Gold on Friday also made its 14th new all-time high in 15 trading days in Euro terms...
           

              
           

             ...up 13.5% in barely 3 weeks...
           

              
           

             ...while 
            the UK gold price in Pounds per ounce added £60 in 24 hours to fix at £1929 at London's 3pm physical benchmark auction.
           

              
           

             Silver has run up even faster, jumping by more than 19% in Dollar terms so far this month alone.
           

              
           

             Indeed, both gold and silver went pretty much vertical. No-one is sure why. But it's got everyone very excited.
           

              
           




              
           

             Is this the top? Might be. For now. Prices have already 
            come back to Tuesday's then-record gold highs since Shanghai and London trading shut for the weekend.
           

              
           

             But this peak might also, long term, be closer to the start than the end. Because the weight of Western investment is perhaps turning around, flipping from the repeated profit-taking of the past 6-12 months into positive demand.
           

              
           

             More on that straw in the wind in a moment. First, who to thank if you've been 
            banking profits on gold or silver? Who to curse if you're still waiting to 
            buy gold or silver on a dip?
           

              
           

             ""Safe-haven demand fuels gold's record rally,"" claims Reuters today.
           

              
           

             ""Gold rallies above $2400 as Middle East risks stoke demand,"" says Bloomberg.
           

              
           

             ""Gold futures hit new record on central bank buying, safe-haven demand,"" adds the 
            WSJ.
           

              
           

             It's hard to overstate the threat of major power conflict right now. Seriously. Yet major-economy stock markets have been rising, hitting new all-time highs of their own rather than spooking Western investors to buy gold.
           

              
           

             What's more, central-bank buying isn't new (and contrary to Forbes' headline, they sure ain't buying gold futures contracts either). Western states stopped selling bullion in 2007 as the financial crisis took hold. Demand led by China, Russia and Turkey then grew the official sector's 
            gold reserve holdings at the fastest pace since World War 2 from 2018 to 2023. And while that half-decade of strong demand has set the tone – led by ongoing and relentless accumulation by the People's Bank of China – ""central banks like orderly gold markets,"" as Rhona O'Connell at brokerage StoneX says, rather than looking to provoke such ""lively"" moves as this.
           

              
           

             As for 'safe haven' demand for gold, it cannot a) refer to Western investment flows right now, because – again – they have been negative, and b) like the central-bank thing, it says nothing about the surge in silver. The more industrially-useful precious metal remains unwanted by national reserve managers, yet it's now trading at the highest for US investors since the $30 tops of 2021 and 2020 and it's reaching higher in Euro terms than any time since 2012 while breaking all-time highs in Japanese Yen.
           

              
           

             To repeat: Western-economy investors have been selling gold, net net, during the 2024 jump in prices so far. Silver has been pouring back to market from Western investors, too.
           

              
           




              
           

             By end-March, BullionVault users had cut their gold holdings 3.0% by weight and silver by 1.2% from New Year 2024...
           

              
           

             ...albeit letting their remaining holdings gain 4.2% and 4.7% by value respectively, taking the sum of their directly-owned, securely stored and fully insured bullion up to a new record above $4.2 billion.
           

              
           

Gold-backed ETFs as a group – the vast bulk of them listed in the West – had meantime dropped $6.5 billion in value, down 2.5% year-to-date even as the metal's price rose over 7% in Dollar terms. And coin dealers in Europe and North America have met such a flood of selling, some German shops are 
            apparently running out of cash while online stores across the West are slashing their mark-ups to try and shift some of the unwanted inventory now piled up in the basement.
           

              
           

             So to figure out what's going on – and what might come next – ignore the Costco story. Or rather, fade the detail versus the impact.
           

              
           

             ""Gold prices red hot 
            as Costco gets in on gold rush,"" says 
            Forbes magazine, repeating PR puff that the US-based discount store has now been 
            enjoying for 6 months and more in the USA and UK (and which began way back in 2020 in, 
            umm, Iceland).
           

              
           

             Now, if you believe the latest puff on 
            USA Today, then selling 1-ounce Maples $130 below spot is 
            proving a great loss leader, worth every cent in breathless PR.
           

              
           

             ""Shiny coins! In a shop! Which you can buy! (Terms & conditions apply, offer limited to 1x paid member's account...)""
           

              
           

             Yet if the claim from a Wells Fargo analyst this week was right (as well as being perfect for yet more PR) and the demand for gold bars at Costco is adding ""between"" $100-$200 million to the wholesale discounter's gross sales each month, then that's frankly insignificant in global terms. It's below the total demand to buy gold on BullionVault for instance (before you account for investor selling) and it's a fraction of the gold pouring out of ETFs in recent months and weeks.
           

              
           

             So who has really been buying? Cue 
            Newsweek (of all places) to 
            get it right...just in time for the story to start changing. Maybe.
           

              
           

             ""China is driving up global gold prices.""
           

              
           

             You've got to agree, year-to-date. While Western investors have been selling, China's central bank has continued to buy, seemingly at any price (another 5 tonnes even at March's then-all-time highs). And while the big jump in China's private gold demand actually began this time last year, it has gone frantic in recent weeks. Not that you'd know any of that from, say, Duke University academic Campbell Harvey.
           

              
           

             Speaking to CBS this week, Harvey said ""Institutional investors are piling in"" rather than Joe Public punters, who anyway find gold ""complicated to buy"" and ""costly to warehouse"". He only compounded those 2 errors by 
            speaking for almost 5 minutes without using the word 'China' once in trying to explain what has been driving gold higher.
           

              
           

             The real story?
           

              
           




              
           

             As BullionVault noted 
            back in March 2023, and then repeated 
            throughout last year and 
            into 2024, ""China's property markets have been very weak, the equity markets have been very weak, and this 
            narrows the universe that investors big and small are likely to look for,"" explains bullion-bank HSBC analyst James Steel to Bloomberg.
           

              
           

             Against all that, ""Gold is a great safe haven."" And while the chatter in Western media asking 
            ""Is this China's Lehmans moment?"" about the failure of Evergrande, Country Garden and other massive real-estate developers missed the fact that Beijing wouldn't allow an uncontrolled credit collapse, China's private-sector gold buying suggests it hit something very like the West's 
            late-2008 crash culturally if not financially.
           

              
           

             You see, it's there – in China – that gold has caught real 'flight-to-safety' demand, hoovered up by people buying jewelry, coins, small bars, kilobars, 
            gold accounts through banking apps, wealth management products, ETFs and mining stocks.
           

              
           

             Contrast that with the lacklustre performance of US-listed gold miners. The 
            HUI index has only just outpaced the S&P500 so far this year, lagging the price of gold itself because – well, because investors in the West haven't been buying gold. So why would they buy gold mining shares?
           

              
           

             China, on the other hand, is the No.1 gold mining, importing, central-bank buying and consumer market. It's also the world's 2nd largest economy by Dollar value, the No.1 by purchasing power parity, and it accounts for 1 in every 6 people on Earth. So there's no rush like a gold rush in China, and there's 
            never yet been a gold rush like this.
           

              
           

             The visible data – due for release from the China Gold Association for January-to-March sometime later this month – will cover jewelry, coin and bar consumption. But ""not only is offline consumption booming,"" says Chinese investment news-site STCN...
           

              
           

             ""Investors are 
            also enthusiastic about investing in gold through mobile and online banking as well as gold investment products on platforms such as Ant Fortune, JD.com Finance, and Tencent Financial Management Connect."" And on top of that comes the Shanghai futures market, throwing kerosene onto the fire.
           

              
           




              
           

             Trading in 
            gold futures and options rarely involves any gold. Speculators betting that the price will rise don't want metal – they want a cash profit.
           

              
           

             But the tail often wags the dog, especially if the mutt is already jumping and barking and running in circles. And with speculative trading in Shanghai entering something of a frenzy in recent weeks – taking the price of physical silver landed in China to a frantic $3 premium above London prices on Friday, a massive 10% incentive for new imports – speculative trading has already risen sharply in New York's Comex futures and options, forcing (if not inviting) a bump in London derivatives trading as well.
           

              
           

             ""LBMA numbers show a massive jump in OTC option volume in March,"" says O'Connell at StoneX, pointing to the daily data from trading members of the London Bullion Market Association for 'over-the-counter' contracts. Options give a bullish player the right to buy at a fixed price sometime in the future, hopefully cheaper than where the actual price will have got to. But on the other side of those trades, they give a bearish player (or simply a merchant) the right to sell at certain price in future, locking in – for instance – today's new record highs no matter what happens to price from here.
           

              
           

             Put another way, the jump in London bullion options' volume might signal a rush of bullish bets, or a rush to lock in prices by mining companies, or both. It also very probably reflects the need for bullion banks and brokerages to cover their exposure to all the bullish bets taken out by their speculative clients as well. Because for every long there must be a short, and that short will need to get or hold gold if they don't want to risk losing money should the price keep shooting higher.
           

              
           

             Will it?
           

              
           

             No financial market moves in a straight line, and if you're looking at gold as a hot trend to jump onto today, then you're more likely to find that it's now at the tail-end of this particular phase.
           

              
           

             Short term, China's demand may well cool as the authorities warn against speculation, and the weight of Western gold selling could see prices struggle over the summer as No.2 consumer India enters its seasonally quiet period.
           

              
           

             But looking ahead, gold has consistently offered investors a way to spread risk, reducing losses when other assets drop without hurting overall returns long term. Comparing gold to its historic highs priced against the stock market or in real terms after you account for inflation, today's new records are actually far below its big peaks of 2011 or 1980. And with gold and silver prices now enjoying clear blue water between today and the levels of only a few weeks ago, there are early signs of Western demand picking up.
           

              
           

             BullionVault, for instance, has seen April 2024 mark the strongest 12-day start to a month since March 2022, when Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine drove safe-haven demand for physical gold among Western investors. Giant gold ETF the GLD has meantime seen a slowdown and small reversal in its giant outflows, as have a handful of other Western-listed trust funds. 
           

              
           

             Straws in the wind? It most likely depends on whether the stiff breeze suddenly hitting Western stock markets turns into something more stormy."
2024-04-11,"Title:What Yellen Really Told China
Article:Are China's factories coming to America...?

 TREASURY Secretary Yellen recently took an airplane to China, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 To our everlasting astonishment the aerial machine arrived intact.
 It was – after all – ""constructed"" by Boeing.
 In China the American potentate read her hosts a severe lesson...and wagged a lecturing finger in their stern faces.
 She bellyached and moaned about Chinese economic ""overcapacity.""
 China – in Ms.Yellen's telling – is overproducing and underconsuming.
 This condition represents a dreadful menace to the United States. Thus the lady mumbled that:
 ""I am particularly worried about...China's enduring macroeconomic imbalances – namely its weak household consumption and business overinvestment...""
 China has long had excess savings, but investment in the real estate sector and government-funded infrastructure had absorbed much of it. Now we are seeing an increase in business investment in a number of ""new"" industries targeted by the PRC's industrial policy. That includes electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and solar.
 ""China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity...When the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products, the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.""
 Last week we placed within our stable Mr.Andrew Zatlin – ""The Moneyball Economist"".
 Here he strips the preceding mummery to its nuts, to its bolts, to its washers and screws:
 ""China has built a massive manufacturing base and they continue to build out the factories.
 ""It's reminiscent of what Japan did in the '70s and '80s, which was to rapidly industrialize and get rich quick.
 ""The Chinese government is taking a page out of that playbook. Basically, you make a lot of stuff, you sell that stuff to other people.
 ""Janet Yellen said she's particularly worried about how China is enduring macroeconomic imbalances. What does that mean?
 ""It means China's making a lot of money and saving it, resulting in weak household consumption. We want China to have a consumer economy...and to stop building factories that are making cheap products that are overwhelming us.
 ""Quite frankly, it's all about jobs. If the US is flooded with cheap Chinese products, US companies go out of business and we lose jobs.
 ""And that's the message from Janet Yellen to China: You're doing the same thing that Japan did, and we're going to stop it.""
 How did the United States stop Japan?
 In the 1980s, Reagan starts pushing hard on Japan. Just like with China, they wanted Japan to boost consumer spending and stop flooding us with their cheap goods.
 You know what happened? Japan moved their manufacturing over to the US Honda and Toyota opened production lines here. By 1996 there were three factories that Toyota was running building cars.
 Thus Andrew expects China to pursue the Japanese example.
 ""Chinese factories will take ship at Shanghai and offload at the Port of Los Angeles...where they will board trains for the American interior.""
 Upon arrival American laborers will empty into them.
 With these factories comes investment opportunity, says Andrew:
 ""So what's the investment play here? Power generation. More US factories mean a higher demand for reliable electric generation. I like infrastructure.""
 Treasury Secretary Yellen refers to ""excess savings"".
 ""Excess savings"" is a devilish condition that – happily – your editor has never endured. He can scarcely conceive its terrors. He would be reduced to purchasing all his goods and services with money in his actual possession.
 A credit card would be an unknown. As would monthly interest payments at 23%.
 Thus he would shatter the central pillar of American economic life – debt-based consumption.
 Pity the forsaken land of excess savings, unblessed by debt. Its debt-to-GDP ratio is not merely zero. It is negative.
 Contrast this hell with the debt-blessed American paradise.
 United States national debt runs to $34.6 trillion. United States total debt – both public and private – runs to a divine $98 trillion.
 And the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio scales 120%.
 Gloria in excelsis Deo!
 Then you have those poor Chinese...afflicted with the plague of excess savings. Their owners fail to appreciate the infinite wonders of debt.
 They are evidently slaves to Say's Law – that production must precede consumption.
 That is, a man must produce before he can consume.
 The government Ms.Yellen represents has long revolted against Mr.Say's iron law.
 It goes along under a sort of Keynesian anti-Say's law – that consumption precedes production.
 She herself rises in active revolt against Mr.Say and his universal law. She does not believe in it.
 What does Ms.Yellen believe in?
 Ms.Yellen believes in the theory that consumer spending represents 70% of the United States economy.
 Let us now proceed to a central assault upon the consumption theory itself – the nearly universal theory that consumer consumption constitutes 70% of the United States economy.
 It likely constitutes far less.
 Official calculations of the gross domestic product neglect tremendous piles of economic goings-on.
 These goings-on include business investment and spending on ""intermediate"" goods.
 These are inputs required for the production of final goods – hence they are intermediate goods.
 The steel in the automobile, the sugar in the candy, the wood in the furniture...these are intermediate goods...for example.
 Yet their purchase does not classify as consumer spending – else they would be double-counted in the ledgers.
 Explains economist Mark Skousen:
 ""GDP only measures the value of final output. It deliberately leaves out a big chunk of the economy – intermediate production or goods-in-process at the commodity, manufacturing and wholesale stages – to avoid double counting.""
 Now mix in expenditures on intermediate goods. What do we find?
 We find that consumer consumption merely constitutes perhaps 30% of GDP. Skousen:
 ""I calculated total spending (sales or receipts) in the economy at all stages to be more than double GDP...By this measure – which I have dubbed gross domestic expenditures, or GDE – consumption represents only about 30% of the economy, while business investment (including intermediate output) represents over 50%.""
 To emphasize: Consumption represents a mere 30% of the gross domestic product. Not the commonly accepted 70%.
 We therefore incline toward the business investment gauge of economic vigor.
 And business investment – over 50% of the gross domestic product – has been steadily shedding steam.
 Thus we harbor a hearty suspicion about the lovely economic reports in current circulation.
 We do not believe them."
2024-04-09,"Title:Old-Aged Nato Faces New World of Warfare
Article:The Nato alliance just turned 75 years old...

 LIKE IT or not, the world is confronting a new age of warfare, marked by escalating conflicts, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, commemorated its 75th anniversary at the start of April, at a time when the 32-member alliance finds itself in an increasingly precarious position.
 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's warning that Europe has entered a ""pre-war era"" underscores the geopolitical challenges going forward and the need to shore up defenses.
 Like it or not, the world is confronting a new age of warfare, marked by escalating conflicts (including those involving non-state actors like Hamas and the Houthis), China's growing influence and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in military applications. Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine has heightened concerns about spillover violence, raising questions about Nato's long-term military support for Kyiv.
 Since the alliance's founding in 1949, the absolute number of armed conflicts globally, as well as the number of war-related deaths, has significantly declined.
 But in more recent years, for reasons that will be historians' job to unpack, hostilities have escalated. Data provided by Our World in Data shows that the total number of armed conflicts across the globe was higher in 2022 than in any year going back to 1989.

 This alarming rise in violence has led to a significant surge in defense spending among Nato allies, with as many as 18 member nations expected to allocate at least 2% of their GDP to defense this year, up from just three countries in 2014, according to the group.
 The changing nature of warfare goes beyond conventional nation-state conflicts, with non-state actors increasingly involved in armed conflicts. The rapid development of AI and machine learning – used in autonomous weapons such as Ukraine's Saker Scout drone – is also raising concerns about their potential use in cyber, physical and biological attacks.
 SIPRI, or the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, reports that European states have nearly doubled their imports of major arms between 2019 and 2023, but the surge is not limited to Europe. The US – which already outspends the next 10 countries combined on national defense – is closely monitoring China's military modernization efforts. Beijing plans to boost its defense budget by 7.2% this year, focusing on developing advanced technologies such as hypersonic missiles and AI.
 
 For investors, rising defense spending presents a compelling opportunity.
 In the US, over half of the Department of Defense (DoD) spending goes to military contractors, with the total contract spending amounting to approximately $400 billion in 2021, the most recent year of data. While this sum is distributed among thousands of contractors and subcontractors throughout the country, the ""Big 5"" firms – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, RTX (formerly named Raytheon), General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman – received nearly 30% of all DoD contract Dollars.
 Meanwhile, the list of US defense industry's AI suppliers is relatively diverse, with 300 contracts distributed among 249 unique vendors in a recent dataset. Of those, only 36 vendors were awarded multiple contracts, and just eight won three or more contracts, including major players Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, according to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). This concentration of AI contracts among a few key players suggests that these companies are well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for innovative military solutions.
 Investing in defense stocks, like other areas, carries risks. The sector is heavily influenced by government policies, geopolitical events and public sentiment. Changes in political leadership, shifts in foreign policy and fluctuations in public support for military interventions can all impact the performance of defense stocks. The industry is subject to strict regulations and oversight, which can affect companies' ability to secure contracts or export their products.
 Despite these risks, I believe the long-term outlook for defense stocks is positive. As nations worldwide increase their military spending, companies at the forefront of defense technology and innovation are likely to benefit. The US defense industry, with its strong presence in the global arms trade and its cutting-edge AI capabilities, is particularly well-positioned.
 Nato has its detractors, but its role in maintaining stability has never been more vital. For astute investors, this presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for innovative defense technologies, particularly from major US contractors."
2024-04-07,"Title:Can the USS Lollipop Sink Anti-Bubble Gold?
Article:Strong jobs report fails to burst bullion's bull run...

 AFTER more standout jobs data, we note that the macro is indeed changing beneath the surface, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Another payrolls report, another beat of expectations. The breakdown illustrates a phenomenon I've been watching unfold for several months in a row; that of unabated government hiring this election year.
 
 The USS Good Ship Lollipop sails along, supported by its vast services economy and construction (a product of the services industries, not a productive industry itself, unlike for example, manufacturing) as well as a continued trend of brisk government hiring this election year.
 I am not going to play politics (I am dispirited by both major parties) but as usual, I am going to lay out facts so that we can properly manage the situation from an investment perspective.
 
 The string of government hiring has been anecdotal, as seen by my eyes and recollected by my brain over the last many months.
 But above is something a little more concrete, courtesy of the St.Louis Fed.
 Government employment has ticked a new all-time high. Since June of 2022 the figure has been robo-trending upward.
 So the Payrolls picture appears rosy as all those services and all that governmental bloat continue apace as the public debt ticks above $34 Trillion.
 
 It is beyond the scope of this article to go into the details of why this leveraged disaster in waiting has not yet resolved into negative market price action. There are many other warning indicators in play. But my work implies that certain forces are doing their best to keep up appearances this election year.
 I try to keep my tin foil hat in excellent working order and only use it on very rare occasions, when FACTS actually line up with tin foil.
 ""Facts"" have indicated a fiscally stimulative government and logic has considered the potential of former Fed chief Yellen to be in coordination with the current Fed, which has been regulating liquidity through its bond markets operations.
 Some question why gold didn't get hammered on the joyous employment news. Well, maybe it is just time.
 With such an obvious farce as the painting of the jobs picture by government hiring and knock on effects (in construction and services) of governmental debt spending to keep the economy fiscally stimulated this election year, gold is simply looking ahead; jumping the creak if you will. Currently it is acting as an inflation scout (one of its utilities, under the right circumstances), but in my opinion it is also looking beyond that.
 
 Gold is the anti-bubble after all, and it appears not to be waiting for bubble markets to pop before getting a move on into the new macro picture, which will be post-bubble and counter-cyclical with, in my opinion, some severe market liquidity issues out ahead, possibly later in 2024 or early 2025. NFTRH has two targets for gold based on patterns. One is within hailing distance at 2450, and the other, 3000+, is in the offing. Likely after some bloody battles are fought along the way.
 As for the dead men walking, the major US stock indexes are still bulling along. SPX, for example, a primary beneficiary of bubble policy, clings to its daily EMA 20 and by the SMA 50 (blue), its uptrend from October, 2023. All those gaps below? They'll be addressed one day. But for now, this dead man keeps on walking because...payrolls! Because...fiscally stimulating government! Because...Fed tight, but not too tight!
 I believe there is a good chance that when the stock market takes a real bear, the precious metals may also get hammered. But the breakout on the gold chart above is more than just a positive technical signal. It represents a major positive move in the making for the anti-bubble and as such, a negative one coming for traditional bubble beneficiaries.
 
 Here is the work done so far by gold vs. the S&P 500. It's been a hard move up within the intact daily chart downtrend. So the trend is still negative, but this is the work (a break through the downtrending SMA 200) that would need to be done to begin a narrative about a trend change (and the end of the bubble macro).
 Gold is even stronger lately vs. global stocks (ex-US). The trend is neutral after a massive spike upward for the monetary metal in relation to global stocks.
 These things take time, patience and perspective. But the process is moving forward toward a coming economic bust and counter-cyclical environment. That is what gold's major breakout is signaling. We are and have been tracking the process every week in NFTRH.

 It's time folks. It's time not be thinking as most have been trained to think over the last two bubbly decades. So says the Continuum above, and many other indications beyond the scope of this article."
2024-04-05,"Title:The Data. Just the Data
Article:Meet the 'Moneyball economist'...

 The WALL STREET JOURNAL labels him ""the Moneyball Economist"" writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 The man's name is Andrew Zatlin.
 Why the ""Moneyball"" economist? Answer shortly.
 Meantime, Bloomberg heaps praise upon his economic forecasting.
 That is because his crystal ball is remarkably and reliably clear.
 He routinely runs his circles around crackerjacks from Goldman, Morgan Stanley and the rest of them.
 And today we are mightily pleased to welcome him aboard our flagship.
 For he has joined Jim Rickards' team of superexcellent economic analysts.
 His contribution is unique...and invaluable.
 In Jim's words:
 ""Up until now, I've been missing a direct connection in analyzing one of the most critical pieces of economic data.
 ""It's an indicator of the overall health of the economy as well as what is moving markets – payroll and jobs data.
 ""That's why over the past few months I've been looking to add an all-star analyst to my team that interprets this hard data which is crucial to understand in these volatile times.
 ""Someone that could give my readers an even greater advantage, with bold predictions and market opportunities that most investors miss.
 ""But as I'm sure you can imagine, finding an A+ economist and analyst isn't easy. To be sure, the best analysts are in high demand or keep a low profile as they like sharing their knowledge with only a select group of people.
 ""That's why today I'm so happy to announce that I've found an exception. And that's Andrew Zatlin.""
 Why is Mr.Zatlin ""the Moneyball Economist""?
 Moneyball refers to the data-plumbing method the Oakland Athletics employed to construct a superior roster – despite a penny-pinched payroll.
 That is, the Oakland Athletics plowed miles deep into baseball statistics...to identify the undervalued players who produced victories...though the league at large looked past them.
 Their batting averages may have sagged, for example. Yet their on-base percentages outshined others – they took their walks.
 And the statistics revealed that on-base percentage is a superior metric to batting average.
 A man who is more frequently on base is a man who crosses home plate more often.
 Thus his contribution to victory is superior.
 And so the Oakland Athletics plucked out this type of fellow.
 This Zatlin adopts the Moneyball model.
 He looks past batting average.
 His economic forecasting instead reduces to the data – and the data alone.
 That is, he looks to on-base percentage...particularly in the unemployment data.
 ""My best ideas,"" says Andrew, ""are based on the data coming from the jobs market.""
 What does the data from the jobs market presently indicate?
 That the consumer is shedding steam. And that eateries – in particular – are in for a good whaling because of it.
 Inflation is to blame:
 ""Nowadays McDonald's is a $50 expense for a family of four. It's a luxury now to go to McDonald's or Five Guys. It's crazy. The consumer is now stuck. They're not going out as much anymore.
 ""You're going to see retail figures come out next month that are going to show a deeper and deeper drop in outside dining and drinking. Until two months ago, you saw double-digit year-on-year growth in that sector.
 ""Now it's low single-digit growth. It's going to go negative pretty soon because consumers are throwing in the towel.
 ""We're seeing everything peak. At some point, something's got to give. And I think that's why the Fed is finally starting to say, Even though inflation is high, it's not meeting our targets, we're going to have to start cutting interest rates. They've got to give the consumer some form of relief.""
 Mr.Zatlin takes the overall view. Thus he trains his eagle eyes upon global supply chains and the economic indications they telegraph.
 His biography reads thusly:
 Andrew has nearly three decades of experience as an applied economist and big data enthusiast. Working in Silicon Valley with Fortune 50 companies at the birth of the new 21st-century global economy has given him unique insight.
 Today's economy is based on the consumer's ever-growing reliance on the digital world, as well as a swiftly changing global supply chain. Andrew has been a part of this revolution since its inception which gives him an unparalleled level of experience. That perspective helps him to uncover and track the data that matters.
 That can easily be seen in the accuracy of his predictions. Andrew connects the dots to paint a picture of emerging trends and economic shifts.
 And now he is at your service.
 You will learn from him – for example – that:
 ""It is now easy to spoof audio and video. There was a company that was recently extorted of $35 million because someone, through a phone call, was able to spoof the CEO's voice and direct a lower-level financial person to transfer $35 million into bank accounts.""
 Brave New World! More:
 ""An Israeli plane traveling from Thailand was almost directed off route toward some other country because the pilots were told with an audio spoof to go and change course in real-time.""
 What if some devil spoofs an American military airplane into China's airspace? What if China shoots missiles at it?
 Now you have an international ""incident"" on your hands.
 What if China wields the invisible power to knock down American infrastructure? Mr.Zatlin:
 ""It was found that 80% of the cranes used in our port facilities are Chinese-made. These are the cranes that load and unload shipping cargo. They discovered that embedded in these big cranes were communication devices.
 ""That's interesting, because that wasn't part of the original spec. Is it simply an efficient way to keep track of how many containers are going in and out? Maybe. But what if this is not just to send information but to receive information?
 ""Maybe you could inform the crane to malfunction, to stop working. Could you bring down our ports if that capability was in there? These are 80% of the cranes in our ports. Imagine all the equipment that's out there that's coming out of China. Nobody's tracking it.
 ""The fact is we've relied on so much equipment that is digitally connected to networks, and we know that hackers through the network can take control.""
 Relatedly: Mr.Zatlin is agnostic on the Francis Scott Key Bridge incident. He does not claim to know its cause.
 Yet he does not heave the cyberattack theory out of court:
 ""How easy or hard is it to sit in your chair somewhere offshore and bring down our infrastructure? I would say it's pretty darn easy.
 ""Let's take the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Nobody would ever weaponize a cargo ship through cyber hacking and drive it into a bridge and bring it down, crippling the port. That's crazy stuff you'd only see in a Tom Clancy story. Right? Well, how do you know?
 ""Could that have been a cyber attack? I'm not saying it was or wasn't. It could well have been just an accident. A lot of experienced shipping experts believe it was. But there's a lot going on in the cyber arena that you never hear about in the media.""
 Yet you will hear about it from Andrew Zatlin.
 Thus with great satisfaction we place him in our locker today. He represents a superior addition to The Daily Reckoning."
2024-04-02,"Title:Western Investors Bank Record Profits on Gold
Article:New record prices as China buys gold, Western investors sell...


              
           


WESTERN INVESTORS  just banked record profits from gold, selling more than twice the quantity that they bought as a group in March using world-leading marketplace BullionVault, as speculative betting by hedge funds, plus China's relentless central-bank demand, drove the price of gold up to new record highs in all major currencies.
           

              
           

             But record-heavy selling by a record number of customers still left client holdings at BullionVault worth fresh record high above $3.2 billion (£2.5bn, €3.0bn).
           

              
           

             ""Previous peaks in the number of people selling gold also came as bullion prices jumped,"" says BullionVault director of research Adrian Ash. ""But they all coincided with moments of acute political or financial stress, spurring stronger investor demand.
           

              
           

             ""In contrast, gold's new all-time highs have come without any external trigger. That speaks to the underlying strength of this uptrend, with relentless demand for physical bullion from emerging-market nations led by China more than offsetting the record-heavy profit taking by Western investors.""
           

              
           

             The price of gold jumped by 8.1% last month – its fastest gain in a year – to finish at a new record of $2214 per Troy ounce (+8.5% to £1752, +8.7% to €2050) after setting a fresh all-time high on 9 of the global wholesale market's 20 trading days across March.
           

              
           

             In response, the number of private investors buying gold on BullionVault – almost 9-in-10 of whose users live in Western Europe or North America – slipped 3.4% to the fewest since December.
           

              
           

             The number of sellers in contrast rose 95.1% to beat the number of sellers in March 2023 (the 'mini crisis' in US regional banking), August 2011 (US debt downgrade, Euro debt crisis, English riots), March 2022 (Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine) and June 2016 (the UK's Brexit referendum shock).
           

              
           

             Together, that took the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of trading decisions among the world's largest single pool of private investors in physical bullion – down to a new series low of 47.5, down 4.0 points from February with its steepest drop since July 2016.
           

              
           

             Tracking gold investor actions since October 2009, the index would read 50.0 if the number of buyers exactly equalled the number of sellers across the month. It reached 65.9 as the Covid Crisis took hold in March 2020, and it set a series high of 71.7 when gold prices hit their global-financial-crisis peak in September 2011.
           

              
           

             The Gold Investor Index has recorded more gold sellers than buyers only twice before (48.8 in Feb 2010, 49.1 in June 2019). 
           

              
           




              
           

             By weight, total demand to buy gold on BullionVault – now open 24/7 since April 2005 – rose 4.5% in March from the previous 12-month average to reach 0.7 tonnes. But selling more than doubled, rising 100.3% to total more than 1.6 tonnes.
           

              
           

             Net-net, that saw private investors liquidate 992 kilograms of gold – 28.0% more than the previous record outflow of June 2019 – worth a record $68.8 million (£54.1m, €63.3m).
           

              
           

             That took investor gold holdings at BullionVault down to 45.5 tonnes, the smallest since 2020 and down by 5.5% from the record high holdings of last August. By value, however, those investor holdings have risen 7.7% in Dollar terms over the past 7 months to finish March at a record $3.2 billion (+8.1% in GBP to £2.5bn, +8.3% in Euros to €3.0bn).
           

              
           

             ""With central banks led by China paying record-high prices for gold, Western investors are increasingly happy to sell, taking profit at the highest prices in history. But this is rebalancing, not a rush for the exits, because their remaining holdings have also risen in value to new record highs, and gold's appeal as a form of investment insurance is undimmed, ready for whatever political or financial crises 2024's highly uncertain outlook could bring.""
           

              
           

             Like gold, silver jumped in price last month, rising 9.8% to its highest monthly close in four at $24.54 per Troy ounce (+10.2% to £19.46, +10.3% to 22.76).
           

              
           

             That saw the number of silver sellers on BullionVault double in March from the month before, up 108.7% to the most since February 2021, when the #silversqueeze ramp on social media sent silver prices towards an 8-year high 1 cent shy of $30.
           

              
           

             Back then, the number of silver buyers across the month was 4.7 times larger than March 2024, putting the Silver Investor Index at 61.0, its 8th highest reading since the series began at New Year 2012. But last month the index sank to a new all-time low, down 5.1 points to 45.0 and signalling more sellers than buyers for the 4th time in the past 12 months.
           

              
           

             By weight, silver selling outran buying by a record 29.8 tonnes, taking the total stock of silver bullion still held down 2.4% to 1,199.8 tonnes, the lowest since April 2021 and 5.3% smaller from the record high of October 2022.
           

              
           

             By value, in contrast, BullionVault users' silver holdings have grown by 11.8% to $878 million (+11.0% in GBP to £750m, +11.8% in Euros to €878m).
           

              
           

             ""Gold's sudden jump to new all-time highs leaves the price looking stretched short term,"" says Ash, ""and the market may struggle to absorb the huge quantity of bullion coming back from Western investors, especially as Asia's big consumer nations head towards the seasonal summer lull in household demand.
           

              
           

             ""While Asia's big gold buying markets can be very price-sensitive short term, consumers have repeatedly grown accustomed to higher gold prices over time. Short of peace and trust breaking out between the West and 'the rest', demand from emerging-market central banks looks set to continue, with the People's Bank of China seemingly happy to buy gold at any price."""
2024-04-01,"Title:Copper Gets Hot on EVs and Smelting Squeeze
Article:Global PMIs also point to growing demand...

 COPPER FUTURES climbed as high as $9,164.50 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange (LME) in mid-March, marking a fresh 11-month high writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 The rally comes hot on the heels of a months-long sideways grind, propelled by supply risks and growing optimism around the global economic outlook.
 Contributing to the run-up is news that as many as 15 Chinese smelters are considering output cuts at a recent high-level meeting in Beijing, which ignited a flurry of trading activity that the LME hasn't seen in years.
 What's more, an average of 11.5% of monitored copper smelter capacity in China was inactive in the first two months of 2024, compared to 8.6% in the same period last year and 8% in 2022, according to UK-based geospatial data firm Earth-i.
 Why are smelters close to cutting supply? Simply put, Chinese operators are facing a crisis over treatment and refining charges, or TC/RCs – fees that are paid to process copper concentrate into refined metal.
 TC/RCs have collapsed due to a shortage of concentrate supply, squeezing already razor-thin profit margins. Beyond supply concerns, copper demand continues to be driven largely by the renewable energy boom.
 According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), copper's share of total demand across all applications is forecast to surge from 23% currently to over 42% by 2050.
 This isn't just hot air. In August 2023, the Department of Energy (DoE) added copper to its official list of critical materials, making domestic producers eligible for government subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The designation underscores copper's pivotal role in securing a sustainable energy future.
 Electric vehicles (EVs), renewable power sources like solar and wind and increasing electrification across the global economy are supercharging copper's demand growth. As I've shared with you before, a single EV requires around four times as much copper as a conventional gas-powered car. All told, EVs could account for nearly 60% of total copper demand by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
 While the green revolution and electrification efforts are set to drive significant demand for copper, I also believe a compelling argument lies in the reshoring efforts of developed economies. According to Crescat Capital's Otavio Costa, the US and other G-7 nations have neglected significant infrastructure investments for over seven decades, and the emerging deglobalization trends are expected to boost these construction undertakings, with copper positioned as a potential major beneficiary.
 In the chart below, you can see how the copper-to-S&P 500 ratio surged in the early 2000s when China spent heavily on construction. That relationship has collapsed in the years since, but if Costa's prediction is accurate, we may see copper soar again relative to the stock market.
 
 Recent Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) figures suggest the manufacturing sector is now in copper's corner. The J.P.Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.3 in February, staying in expansionary territory for a second straight month after emerging from an 18-month contraction.
 Historically, a cross-above event – when the monthly PMI reading tops its three-month moving average – has signaled higher commodity and energy prices three to six months down the road. If the pattern holds, copper and its industrial peers could get an additional tailwind in the months ahead."
2024-03-29,"Title:Lower Rates and Central-Bank Buying Send Gold to New Highs
Article:Fed rate cuts coming as China's consumer demand eases off...

 GOLD staged a blinding comeback after the Fed's March announcement, surging to fresh all-time highs above $2200 an ounce, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 The rally, which has added around 10% to gold's value since mid-February, caught many market watchers off-guard. But for those of us who've stuck with the yellow metal through its ups and downs, the price action is the vindicating result of several powerful forces aligning in bullion's favor.
 At the heart of gold's resurgence is the Federal Reserve's signal that the central bank is on course to cut rates as many as three times in 2024, fueling hopes that the tight monetary policy of the past 18 months is nearing an end.
 With rate cuts on the horizon, real yields have cooled, increasing the relative attractiveness of non-interest-bearing gold.
 Traders have wasted little time pricing in the Fed's dovish stance. Futures markets now see a 72% chance of a rate cut as soon as June, up from 65% before the Fed meeting. Against this backdrop, gold's surge is, I believe, textbook price action.
 But there's more to the rally than just lower rates and a weaker US Dollar.
 Central bank demand for gold has been a powerful driver as more and more developing countries join the de-Dollarization movement in response to Western sanctions on Russia.
 China has led the charge here, consistently adding large amounts of gold to its reserves for the past 16 months straight. Overall central bank buying reached record highs in 2022 and has shown no signs of slowing, helping to offset the selling pressure caused by gold-backed ETFs.
 Higher gold prices have significant implications for the luxury goods market, where the precious metal is a key input cost for jewelry and watch manufacturers. Specifically, the 14% surge in gold prices since last fall appears to be crimping demand.
 In China, the world's largest buyer of gold jewelry, retail sales in the luxury category rose just 5% year-over-year in the first two months of 2024 despite the reopening boom, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This could be worrying for luxury conglomerates like Richemont and LVMH, which were counting on a strong Chinese bounce-back to drive sales higher.
 The pressure is particularly intense for retailers like Chow Tai Fook, the world's second-largest jewelry chain after Richemont-owned Cartier. In its latest quarterly report, Chow Tai Fook said non-gold jewelry sales at its stores in mainland China slid 2% compared to last year due to ""weak sentiment,"" write Bloomberg Intelligence's Catherine Lim and Trini Tan.
 With gold trading near 30-year highs in Yuan terms, the outlook for jewelry demand in China appears challenging unless prices moderate. But the picture isn't all bleak for luxury brands.
 While the appetite for gold trinkets may be suppressed right now due to high metal prices, overall luxury spending by Chinese consumers rebounded strongly in 2023 as the country emerged from Covid lockdowns.
 According to research firm Bain & Company, Chinese luxury purchases within mainland China recovered to an estimated 70% of pre-pandemic levels last year, with tourism spending in Europe and Asia also witnessing a comeback.
 
 Looking ahead, Bain projects mid-single-digit growth for China's luxury market in 2024, supported by the nation's still-robust fundamentals for high-end consumption. A lot will depend on how issues like China's property sector crisis and consumer confidence play out in the coming months.
 Regardless of any near-term volatility, China's increasingly wealthy middle class will continue driving demand for luxury goods and services.
 For investors, I believe the recipe is clear: Consider allocating 10% of your portfolio to physical gold and high-quality gold mining stocks. The same fundamentals that have revived gold's current bull market – lower real rates, central bank buying, safe-haven appeal – could remain in place in the months and years ahead."
2024-03-27,"Title:Japan's $1.5 Trillion Pension Fund Lesson for Gold investing
Article:Risk, reward and retirement savings...


              
           


NOW managing $1.5 trillion-worth of savings, Japan's national pension fund is the largest pension fund in the world, 
            writes Adrian Ash at $3 billion gold investing platform BullionVault.


              
           

             So you might guess that its fund managers know a thing or two about investing.
           

              
           

             And they do. Two things in one word, in fact, as we'll see in a second.
           

              
           

             But they don't know much about 
            gold investing. Not yet. Luckily, they would like to know more!
           

              
           




              
           

             Lumping gold in with 'illiquid' alternative assets such as forestry and farmland shows just how much the GPIF still has to learn.
           

              
           

             More on that below. But knowing what you don't is the first step to wisdom, or 
            so everyone says. And now that it's seeking to understand gold, Bitcoin, farmland and forestry here in 2024, what is it that Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund already understands?
           

              
           

             Two things in one word: Diversify. 
           

              
           

             First, the GPIF splits its investment half-and-half between domestic and foreign assets, rather than buying only Japanese stocks and bonds.
           

              
           

             Second, and instead of putting the pension savings of the world's oldest population into all stocks or all bonds, it splits that money 50:50 between shares and fixed income.
           

              
           

             So far, so smart. The GPIF's policy of diversification has both smoothed and boosted total returns for Japan's pensioners and would-be retirees compared with holding just stocks or just bonds or with investing in a mix of only Japanese securities.
           

              
           

             That's the Holy Grail of fund management, and of investing more widely.
           

              
           

             Lower volatile. Bigger gains. Who doesn't want that?
           

              
           

             But there's a third thing to know about diversification, a thing which the GPIF now wants to understand:
           

              
           

             How to go beyond stocks and bonds.
           

              
           

             This switch is already underway, because GPIF has in fact been investing 
            in some alternatives since 2013. Latest data say it now exposes 1.4% of Japan's national pension savings to infrastructure, private equity and real estate – the 3 big mainstream alternatives it also names first in last week's request for information – with the aim of reaching 5.0% allocation sometime soon.
           

              
           

             But for now, and just like for the vast bulk of pension funds worldwide today, stocks and bonds dominate the risk and rewards facing your retirement savings. So might squeezing in some alternative assets help? 
           

              
           

             Here at BullionVault, we can't vouch for farmland or forestry, never mind Bitcoin. Sure, the crypto 'currency' has soared in price...
           

              
           

             ...boosting gains for anyone willing to buy and hold the hype across the past year, 5 years, decade or even longer.
           

              
           

             But on the evidence to date, anyone wanting to spread risk from a portfolio holding equities should know that Bitcoin shows a positive and not insignificant correlation with US stocks.
           

              
           

             Put another way, and on our analysis of the past 10 years at least, it has tended to rise when stocks went up, but it also fell when stocks went down. So while adding a little crypto might have juiced your total performance, it would have worsened your losses when the stock market fell, rather than working to offset those losses and smooth your returns.
           

              
           

             That makes Bitcoin an intensifier, not a diversifier. Which is fine if that's what you want. But you'll struggle to explain it to your pension fund trustees. They want steady and safe, not sex and violence.
           

              
           

             So what about gold?
           

              
           




              
           

             To repeat, Japan's national pension fund currently holds 4 buckets of investments.
           

              
           

             It's split pretty much exactly 25% in each of Japanese bonds, Japanese shares, foreign bonds and foreign shares.
           

              
           

             This spread means that, since the GPIF took its current form in 2001, it has...for instance...almost tripled its annualized return compared with investing only in Japanese government bonds.
           

              
           

             But holding some of those bonds has also helped it soften the gut-awful 16% loss from Japanese stocks of 2018, never mind the 40% plunge of 2008.
           

              
           

             Adding foreign assets in a 50:50 mix also means the GPIF has beaten holding only domestic Japanese shares and bonds, enjoying an extra 0.5 percentage points per year since 2001 on BullionVault's analysis.
           

              
           

             That's despite the headline return from Tokyo's Topix share index beating global equities over the past decade (dividends included) with Tokyo stocks giving compound annual growth of 12.3% rather than 8.9% from the MSCI All Countries Weighted Index.
           

              
           

             How come? Because of Japan's beaten-down currency.
           

              
           

             Thanks to negative rates and monster QE money creation from the Bank of Japan, 
            the Yen has sunk on the currency market, losing one-third of its value so far this century.
           

              
           

             That means foreign shares have in fact returned 13.2% for Japanese investors...one whole percentage point per year ahead of the Topix.
           

              
           

             Adding foreign shares and bonds can prove smart, in other words, especially when the central bank in your home nation resolves to weaken your currency with zero interest rates and relentless QE money creation.
           

              
           

             But as our chart above shows, the GPIF could have done better again by adding a little or more gold, thereby enjoying its next-to-zero correlation with stocks or bonds.
           

              
           




              
           

             Of course, the GPIF is finally coming around to the idea of buying gold precisely as the shiny yellow metal runs to new all-time highs in all currencies. Not least 
            gold priced in the Japanese Yen!
           

              
           

             So a contrarian investor might worry that last week's news sounds a little like a clanging bell screaming ""Top! Top!"" for gold.
           

              
           

             But maybe the GPIF isn't looking at gold as a diversifier. Maybe, alongside Bitcoin, it thinks gold could work to intensify its risk-return profile rather than smoothing it. Because, clearly, it doesn't understand much about gold at the moment...
           

              
           

             ...calling it illiquid rather than knowing how 
            gold is one of the most liquid assets you can trade.
           

              
           

             Either way, gold has to date never featured in anyone mainstream retirement funds. Physical bullion pays no interest or yield, and so it just doesn't fit with the logic of wanting to build a nice stream of income, ready to keep writing cheques to your pensionable members.
           

              
           

             Cracking that market, and encouraging the trillion-dollar pension fund industry to put even a fraction of one per cent of its cash into gold, has long been a big ambition for the miners, promoters, dealers and custody providers of the gold industry.
           

              
           

             Central banks, yes. They stopped selling and began buying gold as a group well over a decade ago. The result is plain to see today as gold prices set new all-time highs even with Western investors and traders taking profit and cutting their holdings.
           

              
           

             Add some of that pension-fund cash...plus a rebound in Western investment flows more broadly...and who knows?
           

              
           

             Japan's GPIF request for information could make $2200 per Troy ounce look cheap in hindsight. Maybe."
2024-03-27,"Title:Money, Gold, Capital Controls and Your Future
Article:Eternal truths about the outlook for gold and mining stocks...

 MONEY, in whatever form it is held, has uses, writes Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 Traditional economists assign money three characteristics.

 Money is a unit of account – we can price things with it;
 It is a medium of exchange – we can use it as a helpful replacement to the barter system, exchanging one good for another;
 And it is a store of value – it retains its purchasing power over time.

Our modern electronic money still retains the first two characteristics. But as for the third!
 Since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the US Dollar, for example, has lost roughly 98% of its purchasing power. The Pound Sterling has fared no better. Indeed every unbacked paper currency in history has ultimately failed. The Dollar will be no different. It is only a question of time.
 Gold and silver developed as money in a free market. Throughout human history we have used all kinds of things as money – cattle, shells, nails, tobacco, cotton, even giant stone slabs. But gold and silver always won out over the competition.
 People tended over time to favour the precious metals as money because of their scarcity, durability, malleability and beauty. Their use arose without coercion. Gold is the money of freedom. Gold is also scarce. And it is horribly expensive, in both capital and human terms, to dig out of the earth and process.
 To produce one ounce of fine gold requires 38 man hours, 1,400 gallons of water, enough electricity to run a large house for ten days, up to 565 cubic feet of air under straining pressure, and quantities of chemicals including cyanide, acids, lead, borax and lime. But once produced, being chemically inert, gold lasts.
 Peter L. Bernstein (in his somewhat sceptical treatise 'The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession') points out that you can find a tooth bridge made of gold for an Egyptian 4,500 years ago. Its condition is good enough that you could pop it into your mouth today.
 And it is wonderfully malleable. If you have just an ounce of gold, you can beat it into a sheet covering one hundred square feet. Or if you prefer, you could draw it into a wire 50 miles in length.
 Clearly, gold is also a thing of beauty. ""Oh, most excellent gold!"" said Columbus on his first voyage to America. ""Who has gold has a treasure [that] even helps souls to paradise.""
 But gold is heavy, dense and impractical to carry around. So using paper certificates to represent gold held safely in reserve was a logical next step. The problem arose when greedy bankers realised that they could print more certificates than they had gold in reserve to back them.
 The language associated with gold is invariably derogatory today. Those of us who see any role for gold in the modern world are dismissed as gold bugs. Our response is to label those sceptics paper bugs: they have to believe that unbacked fiat money will last. History, however, is on our side.
 In recent monetary history 1971 amounts to Year Zero for gold, because that is when President Nixon finally took the US Dollar off the gold standard. This has led to a 50-year-plus experiment in money that remains unprecedented. When Robert Mundell was made a Nobel Laureate in Economics in 1999, he pointed out that the ""absence of gold as an intrinsic part of our monetary system today makes our century, the one that has just passed, unique in several thousand years.""
 Robert Mundell could see the way the world was going. In March 1997, two years before receiving his Laureate, Mundell would remark, ominously, ""Gold will be part of the international monetary system in the twenty-first century."" The author Nathan Lewis agrees. The title of his 2007 book on the subject? 'Gold: The Once and Future Money.'
 Government debts throughout the world are simply too high – perhaps so high that it is now impossible to reconcile them. As gold investor Egon von Greyerz puts it:
 ""In 1971, Nixon, by closing the Gold window, started the most spectacular bonfire of the US government budget books. How wonderful, no more accountability, no more shackles and no more gold deliveries to de Gaulle in France who was clever to ask for gold instead of Dollars in debt settlement from the US. So from August 1971, the US embarked on a money printing and credit expansion bonanza never seen before in history. Total US debt went from $2 trillion in 1971 to $200 trillion today – up 100X! So we are getting very close to the end of the current monetary system which will die just like they all have throughout history. GOT GOLD?""
 Strategist Russell Napier:
 ""If central bankers' manipulation of prices fails to generate strong private demand and inflation, then the necessary debt to GDP reduction must come in highly destructive ways for the owners of capital. Society will have to choose between austerity, default, or the creation of a government demand-driven reflation. These are the only three options if central bankers fail to boost growth and also inflation. Austerity would bring depression; default would bring bankruptcy, and a government demand-driven reflation would bring some degree of suspension of the market economy. These are painful and difficult choices if central banks fail. [I] believe that society will most likely choose the apparently least painful route and thus we now face a massive structural shift away from a market-orientated economic system.""
 In short, Napier predicts the reintroduction of capital controls, as governments simply elect to replace the central banks in the cause of stimulating inflation. The reintroduction of capital controls (last seen in the UK, for example, in 1979, after which the newly elected Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wisely and boldly abandoned them) would be a terrible metastasis of the financial crisis.
 Russell Napier again:
 ""There are many who see the above scenario as 'the end of the world' but of course it isn't. For the man in the street it involves another economic shock but then a 'democratic' reflation without the assistance of the discredited [central] bankers. The cycle that results will be full of growth and mainly inflation. It would reduce the debt burdens of many and feel a lot better than the deflation wrought by market forces. The inevitable massive capital misallocation that results from any government-driven investment cycle would take many years to become evident and produce negative impacts. This will not seem like the end of the world for most people. However for the stewards of private sector capital there will be little to do in such a world of mandated prices and conscripted capital.""
 If you're unfamiliar with precisely what 'capital controls' might be, they could plausibly include taxes, tariffs, outright legislation and restrictions on trade. Capital controls could be imposed across equities, bonds and the foreign exchange markets. Let us consider for a moment the implications of Russell's warning.
 ""A shift to the conscription of capital by government to force a government-led investment cycle would be very positive for gold. Gold, the form of capital that is easiest to move without trace, is the most difficult form of capital for governments to conscript. Those qualities will produce many buyers as the nature of the authorities' response to our deflationary bust become ever more apparent. So how do we weigh up the negative impacts for gold of a rising US Dollar and rising real interest rates with the positives associated with increased government intervention in markets? We wait for the gold price to rise even as the US Dollar is rising. That should provide sufficient evidence that the threat of a government-instigated reflation is more than offsetting the negatives associated with the current deflation. Should that reflation succeed, then gold would likely be a major beneficiary as positive real rates of interest would turn into negative real rates that would be sustained by financial repression for perhaps a few decades.""
 We note, in passing, that gold is now trading at new nominal highs even in US Dollar terms.
 We would argue that central bank monetary policy in terms of the fight against inflation has failed ever since the height of the Global Financial Crisis. In terms of economic growth, the central banks' efforts at providing recovery have come to naught. If Russell Napier's analysis is right, governments will soon take over, and the money printing will then resume in earnest. In such an environment, gold, being a finite and precious commodity that is also no-one's liability, is in prime position to enter a sustained bull market. We believe Napier is right.
 Why own gold? Because it makes sense, within a properly diversified portfolio, to have portfolio insurance. If you inhabit a home, it makes sense to have home insurance. Your investments are no different. In a world of paper assets (like certificates of deposit or corporate or government bonds), some of gold's attributes are unique. When it comes to credit and counterparty risk, gold comes with neither. Gold does not rely for its value on the solvency of some third party. It is not a claim against anything. Which is why gold is the perfect insurance against the failure of conventional money or the default of conventional debt. It is why gold is a more perfect form of money than any government-issued alternative.
 How best to describe gold? The investment consultant Andreas Acavalos has provided the best definition we have so far heard:
 ""Gold is not even an investment. It is a conscious decision to refrain from investing until an honest monetary regime makes the rational calculation of relative asset prices possible.""
 Our friend Charlie Morris offers a variation on this theme. He compares gold to a conventional bond. He describes gold as a zero coupon, perpetual, irredeemable bond. With no credit risk. With no counterparty risk. Issued by God.
 Continuing this theme, one quotation from the world of economics fills us with more concern than any other. It comes from Ludwig von Mises. As someone with first-hand experience of the notorious Weimar-era hyperinflation, von Mises warned:
 ""The credit expansion boom is built on the sands of banknotes and deposits. It must collapse. There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as a result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion, or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved.""
 Our central bankers have made it abundantly dear that the credit expansion must and will continue. If von Mises is correct, then the ultimate resolution of the crisis is also clear: ""a final and total catastrophe of the currency system.""
 Which is why you need to own gold now. You buy fire insurance before your house is already ablaze. It is too expensive, if it is even possible, to buy it once the fire has broken out.
 Faith in paper currencies, and in the governments that issue and consistently degrade them, doesn't follow a linear progression. Avalanches don't happen in tidy stages. Snow continues to pile up until the system tips from being stable to unstable, whereupon one random snowflake will cause the entire snow mass to collapse. We just don't know which snowflake it will be. Similarly, we don't know which act of monetary insanity will cause the financial system to implode.
 In summary, why gold? Because it's been a store of value for thousands of years. And it represents a form of money with no credit or counterparty risk. Why gold now? Because the risk of a global monetary fiasco rises by the day.
 Depending on the extent of one's savings and one's risk appetite, there are three ways of getting exposure to the investment merits (and risks) of gold:

 Physical metal. This is the purest form of gold ownership, but it involves counterparty risk if held with a third-party custodian.
 The largest and best capitalised gold mining companies. This offers the potential of higher returns than from the gold price alone given the operational leverage of many gold miners, but it also involves equity market risk.
 Depending on the size of your wallet and your attitude to risk, there are the junior miners too. In a gold bull market, the returns from owning smaller-cap miners are likely to be higher, but they'll come with additional risk of corporate failure.

Each of the above can also be held in the form of low-cost ETFs (exchange traded funds) or actively managed funds [albeit without any direct ownership, Ed.]. We favour some diversification into mining company stocks because of what has happened in the history of gold.
 For example, Executive Order #6102, signed by President Franklin D.Roosevelt on 5 April 1933, made the private ownership of gold illegal in the United States, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or up to ten years in prison, or both. Clearly we no longer operate within a gold standard but we'd rather not take any chances – hence the merit of ownership of interests in gold mining concerns as well as the physical asset itself.
 If you elect to own gold, you probably want to give some thought to where it's custodied. It makes no sense to own gold within the onshore banking or financial system – where national governments might ultimately start to display distinctly unconventional attitudes to the sanctity of private investors' property. It does make sense to hold gold in safe custody offshore.
 Our preferred foreign jurisdictions (from the perspective of a UK-based investor), in no particular order, would include Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and Canada.
 If you elect to own gold, ensure that you own allocated gold – that is, gold owned outright by you and held in your name. You don't want exposure to unallocated gold – which is the property of the custodian. That's like being a depositor/unsecured creditor all over again.
 There are far too many paper claims on gold and simply not enough of the physical asset to support them. Paul Mylchreest, editor of The Thunder Road Report, a specialist gold publication, wrote some years ago warning of a potential short squeeze in the physical market:
 ""The next major leg up in the gold price will prove to be a religious experience for those people unfortunate enough to find themselves short.""
 Another thing to watch out for if you hold gold in the form of a fund is that that gold can't be lent out, or 'rehypothecated'. Again, there are too many people playing too many games in the fractional gold physical market – and there is insufficient supply of the physical asset to support all the contingent claims upon it. You don't want to be caught short as and when the next run to gold begins. (And it probably already has.)
 To sum up the argument for gold, we'd like to share some words by an asset manager and friend, Tony Deden, who may have thought about the parlous state of our financial system and its implications more profoundly than anyone else we know:
 ""Substance is something that is real. It does not necessarily have to be tangible, but that would be preferable. Whether it is in gold – a form of money – or honest entrepreneurship, substance is rooted in economic reality. And so, understanding substance, whether it is in money or in entrepreneurial and wealth-creating activity, is the most important practical skill we must acquire.
 ""Indeed, the price of gold in money may increase. It may also decrease. When do you sell it? You ought to first decide why you own it. But even then, let me ask: 'What sort of substance will you acquire with the proceeds from the sale?'
 ""One of the greatest lessons in classical economics is that value is subjective. It is subjective to the aims and criteria and judgment of the person doing the valuing. And frankly, in our dishonest world, such subjective value is the cornerstone to what kind of capital you are likely to command in the future.""
 We face grave threats and growing uncertainties within the financial markets. Gold doesn't solve all of the world's problems and it would be silly to believe it does. But as an alternative to keeping flawed money in a flawed banking system, it's a useful start.
 It's a hedge against both inflation and systemic financial distress. And it's the best performing money in counterparty risk and purchasing power terms that you can own."
2024-03-26,"Title:Time to Buy Gold Mining Stocks?
Article:Patience remains gold-mining investment's key virtue...

 GOLD MINING stocks are among the most hated equities in the stock market, but that will change as the macro shifts in their favor for the first time since 2001-2003, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 It is the nature of the masses, the majority, the consensus...the HERD...to follow the trend.
 It is a lot easier to swim downstream than to fight the current. Just go with the flow. And from a US-centric view the flow has, with a blessed interruption from 2001 to 2003, been inflationary monetary policy free flowing into asset markets as needed and on demand at every point of financial crisis since. Armageddon '08 and the Covid crash were two primary examples.
 With the 30-year Treasury bond yield 'Continuum' lower squarely showing a disinflationary trend for decades, full license was given to our policy heroes to act, mopping up each crisis with an unrelenting fire hose of 'Whatever it takes!' monetary policy.
 Throw in a side order of government (democrat or republican) always willing to spend and stimulate its favored areas (often very different areas per the party in power, but favored areas nonetheless) and you've got an ongoing bubble in monetary and fiscal policy. You also got a toxic environment for the wretched companies that dig the monetary metal (which is well outside the 'debt for growth' system) out of the ground.
 This chart tells a story of something that was in place for decades (going back to the 1980s, not shown on this chart) that is no longer in place.
 
 30 year Treasury yield continuum, which implies a new macro and a new era for gold stocks
 In my opinion, markets operating as if all is as it has been (hello US headline indexes, bad breadth and all) are dead men walking.
 The Continuum is a pictorial view of the funding mechanism of the bubble. Well, the mechanism is severely altered, if not broken.
 I began this post with the intention to keep it very simple and have already veered from that course. So let's get it back on course. Let's take a look at gold mining stocks through the prism of their relationship to gold and gold's relationship to other markets.
 This daily chart shows that in 2023 gold stocks (HUI) had rightly traveled both positively and negatively in line with their best fundamental gauges. Those are gold's relationships with commodities and inflation.
 
 When gold declined in relation to inflation signalers like 'inflation expectations' gauge RINF and commodity index GNX, gold stocks declined right along with them. As it became apparent that inflation was weakening and gold rose vs. those items, gold stocks rallied.
 Then came the disconnect and positive divergence (for gold stocks) by gold's relationship to the inflation signalers (RINF, GNX, etc). I believe this happened because the herd finally bought the disinflationary 'Goldilocks' (soft landing or even NO landing) story as euphoria set in and Tech/Growth stocks gained momentum.
 The hard decline by HUI from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 aped the decline in gold vs. the stock market (SPX). Of course, the HUI/Gold ratio tagged right along.
 ""Gold stocks suck!"" demands the herd. And the herd is right; for now.
 The NFTRH view has for over a year been for disinflationary Goldilocks to be followed by an uncomfortable decline in inflation. In other words, a deflation scare, quite possibly as a precursor to the next terrible inflation phase out in 2025 or thereafter.
 With indexes like SPX, NDX and SOX still orbiting in blue sky the Gold/SPX ratio is in the tank and right along with it have been gold stocks (and their ratio to gold). While Gold/GNX and Gold/RINF have represented a positive divergence for gold stocks, Gold/SPX has been quite the opposite. Hence, we await the end of the currently at high risk bull market in stocks.
 Here is the same chart, expanded to a long-term view showing the 2001-2003 period when Gold/SPX rose, Gold/GNX rose and by extension, HUI/Gold and nominal HUI rose. There was no such thing as an 'inflation expectations' ETF back then, but using TIP/TLT or TIP/IEF, you'd get the same result; gold rising in relation to those ratios.
 After 2003, gold mining stocks entered a bubble as they blasted off to the stratosphere despite a negative macro as gold under-performed commodities and flat lined vs. stocks during that inflationary time.
 
 I usually disregard political rancor in my analysis, but this year I have been hit over the head with the fact that the Fed has been monetizing out the back door while playing tough guy on TV (to the public).
 It is not lost on me that Biden administration Treasury Secretary Yellen is the Fed chief who preceded Powell and is probably hard wired to him. My tin foil hat thesis is that she's got his ear, if she's not actively coordinating with him.
 Here again is NFTRH subscriber Michael Pollaro's graph showing the sneaky monetization of debt ongoing, as if a regulator or pressure release to its hawkish Fed Funds policy as consumed by the public.
 
 As a side note, to say I am proud of and even awed by the sophistication of the NFTRH subscriber base would be an understatement. This man has been doing this kind of work longer and much more astutely than I.
 So we have established that the Fed has been hawkish, but not really. Now let's also consider that the massively contentious, rancorous and frankly, scary election year of 2024 is for all the marbles. Let's consider that the Biden administration has got the Semiconductor CHIPS Act in its hip pocket as well as whatever new 'Green' and/or 'infrastructure' initiatives it may activate to temporarily stimulate the economy.
 In my view they will hold some cards close to the vest until a strategic moment this election year and then let 'er rip. The Trump candidacy could be incinerated in one fell swoop if the economy gets goosed at the right time.
 The above represents both Monetary (Fed) and Fiscal (government) policy potentials and is a reason I have had to revise my original view for the stock rally from Q1-Q2, and then Q4, 2023 to potentially into or even through the 2024 election. ""Potentially"", mind you. With the risk levels (by so many indicators beyond the scope of this article, but illustrated frequently over the last several months) currently in play, a condition (although not a timer) for a top is already in place.
 Circling back to gold stocks, the miners' product is doing just fine, up there in blue sky as well. Although gold's blue sky is nothing like the bubble beneficiaries like the major stock indexes. But if, like me, you think the stock market is a dead man walking, it will only be a matter of time before the macro fully aligns for gold stocks and the massive pro-stocks herd, which would never consider a filthy investment like gold stocks, ends up wrong as it always does sooner or later.
 It's been a long time since 2003. A couple decades is too long to fight a market based on principle. I believe strongly in giving my best effort to illustrate what I see, not what I want to see.
 What I see now is a big macro shift in progress. Not complete, but methodically progressing.
 Patience."
2024-03-25,"Title:Market Highs? All About the Pivot
Article:Fed hiked rates, yet policy loosened...

 The FEDERAL RESERVE began kinking its monetary hose two years back, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 This it did through fevered interest rate elevations and quantitative tightening.
 Yet the stock market put out its tongue, placed its thumbs in its ears and wiggled its fingers in Mr.Powell's face.
 It has gone streaking to record heights – despite the Federal Reserve's kinks.
 A conundrum! Or is it?
 We are informed that financial conditions are presently extravagant.
 They are among the loosest in several decades. Simon White of Bloomberg:
 ""Monetary policy remains exceptionally loose given one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles seen....policy overall remains very loose despite over 500 basis points of rate hikes....
 ""Standing back and looking at the totality of monetary policy in this cycle, we can see that – far from conditions tightening – we have instead seen one of the biggest loosenings of them in decades.""
 Is it evidence you seek? Then it is evidence you shall have:
 
 The steeply ascending red represents the Federal Reserve's target rate.
 The largely descending blue represents financial conditions as Bloomberg gauges them.
 The Federal Reserve has undertaken four rate elevation cycles within the past 30 years.
 None has yielded a greater financial loosening than the present cycle.
 How do you explain it?
 Here Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway – they of the Odd Lots newsletter – hazard an attempt:
 ""It certainly feels like there's a pattern where the mere whisper of rate cuts sparks easier financial conditions (as markets rally), while hawkish moves seem to do hardly anything....
 ""As Viktor Shvets over at Macquarie put it this week: 'Any hint of the Fed considering an even minor pivot significantly eases financial conditions while a more hawkish tone only barely tightens'.""
 We believe there is justice here.
 Further disentangling this perplexing knot – perhaps – is a certain Stephane Renevier.
 ""Interest rates aren't the be-all and end-all of financial conditions. Yes, higher rates generally mean pricier loans – but there are a whole lot of other factors that affect how easy or tough it is for firms and everyday folks to get financing and keep the economic show on the road.
 ""Think about the cost for companies to borrow (credit spreads), how well the stock market is doing (that's another source of financing) and how strong the Dollar is (a weaker Dollar means cheaper loans for people around the world who take on debt in greenbacks, pumping more cash into the global economy).
 ""Since the end of last year, all those factors have turned more positive and have offset the US' towering interest rates, making financial conditions looser, not tighter.""
 The stock market ebbs and flows with shifting financial conditions....as the tide ebbs and flows with the moon's shifting humors.
 Is it a wonder – then – that the stock market has ebbed with the ebbing financial tide?
 We hazard it is no wonder whatsoever.
 For financial conditions are as loose and lax as a harlot's virtue – if not looser and laxer.
 Yet the Federal Reserve believes it has guarded its own virtue with fantastic ferocity.
 It believes its anti-inflationary whim-whams have choked financial conditions nearly to death. Mr.Powell at the FOMC press conference:
 ""We think financial conditions are weighing on the economy.""
 Has this fellow trained his eyes upon the figures?
 We must conclude he has not. Or – or – he is aware of them and intends to depress rates regardless.
 For what purpose....we are reduced to speculation. We do not know.
 This we do know:
 Wall Street heavily expects the Federal Reserve to soon execute its cherished pivot – perhaps in June.
 And we believe Wall Street is correct. The Federal Reserve will soon commence its rate-depressing campaign.
 And so a question rises into air:
 If financial conditions are lenient while rates have taken an extended hike....how much more lenient will they be once the Federal Reserve depresses rates?
 Will they rocket the stock market to truly cosmic heights? Will they kindle inflation's flames?
 The above-cited Renevier:
 ""Since easier financial conditions are like steroids for the economy, and inflation is a result of stronger economic growth, it makes sense that investors are expecting inflation to rise again.
 ""Now, that does go against what the Federal Reserve says it's trying to achieve – ie, keeping inflation around its 2% target. And if the central bank does cut interest rates three times this year, as it suggested just this week, that could lead to even cushier financial conditions – and further stoke the risk of an inflation comeback.""
 We contest the claim that inflation is the consequence of economic growth. We nonetheless permit the case to proceed....
 ""These policymakers are betting that inflation will dial down as the job market cools, and are probably expecting those other factors (credit spreads, the stocks' rally and Dollar weakness) to mellow out too – all of which could take some heat off inflation. But at the same time, they're also placing a wager on stronger economic growth. It's a razor-thin line they're trying to walk.
 ""And in the meantime, we're in a weird spot: economic growth picking up, inflation flirting with a comeback and financial conditions easing way more than you'd expect, given where interest rates are. That mixed vibe is why oil and copper prices are on a tear (they both like strong growth and a whiff of inflation), why gold and Bitcoin are hitting it big (they're the cool kids when financial conditions loosen and inflation flexes) and why stocks are smashing it against all odds (they thrive on robust growth and easy money conditions, and aren't overly bothered by inflation).
 ""We might not be in this peculiar position for long: Inflation could turn the heat way up, and put financial conditions into a deep freeze, and all of that could put a damper on growth.
 ""But for now, the party's on.""
 What will Powell and mates do then?
 Yet then is then and now is now.
 Indeed....for now....the party is on, because the Federal Reserve is this party's host.
 We do not trust its management of the liquor that sustains it. We hazard the attendees....presently thrilling to alcoholic excitements....are in for one royal hangover."
2024-03-20,"Title:SVB Crisis: Not Finished Yet?
Article:Not judging by past crises, nor current stresses...

 REMEMBER the Banking Crisis of March to May 2023? asks Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 It began with the collapse of the little-known Silvergate Bank on March 8. This was followed the next day by the collapse of the much larger Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on March 9. SVB had over $120 billion in uninsured deposits.
 Bank deposits over $250,000 each are not covered by FDIC insurance. Those depositors stood to lose all their money over the insured amount. This would have led to the collapse of hundreds of startup tech businesses in Silicon Valley that had placed their working capital on deposit at SVB.
 There were also much larger businesses such as Cisco and at least one large cryptocurrency exchange that had billions of Dollars on deposit there. Those businesses would have taken huge write-downs based on the size of their uninsured deposits.
 On March 9, the FDIC said that indeed the excess deposits were uninsured, and depositors would get ""receivership certificates"" of uncertain value and zero liquidity instead.
 By March 11, the FDIC reversed course and said all deposits would be insured. The Federal Reserve intervened and said they would take any US Treasury securities from member banks in exchange for par value in cash even if the bonds were only worth 80% of par (which most were).
 That Sunday night they also closed Signature Bank, a New York-based bank with crypto links. The damage wasn't done. On March 19, the Swiss National Bank forced a merge of UBS and Credit Suisse, one of the largest banks in the world. Credit Suisse was on the edge of insolvency.
 Finally, on May 1, First Republic Bank, with over $225 billion in assets, was ordered closed by the government and sold to J.P.Morgan.
 It was the mother of all bailouts and seemed to leave stock market investors unfazed. The issue was, and is: Once you've guaranteed every deposit and agreed to finance every bond at par value, what's left in your bag of tricks? What can you do in the next crisis that you haven't already done – except nationalize the banks?
 After five bank failures in two months and a trillion-Dollar bailout by the government, the crisis seemed over. But that was false comfort. I wrote at the time that the crisis wasn't over, that it was just halftime.
 Investors are relaxed because they believe the banking crisis is over. That's a huge mistake. History shows that major financial crises unfold in stages and have a quiet period between the initial stage and the critical stage.
 This happened in 1994 when the spring bond market massacre seemed contained in the summer only to explode into the Mexican Tequila Crisis in December.
 It happened in 1997-98 when the Asian financial crisis calmed down in the winter of 1998 only to explode into the Russia-LTCM crisis the following August and September.
 It happened during the Global Financial Crisis when the original distress in August 2007 that seemed contained was followed by the failures of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Bros. from March to September 2008.
 The average duration of these financial crises is about 20 months. This new crisis began 12 months ago. It could have eight more months to run, if not longer.
 On the other hand, this crisis could reach the acute stage faster. That's because of technology that makes a bank run move at the speed of light. With an iPhone you can initiate a $1 billion wire transfer from a failing bank while you're waiting in line at McDonald's. No need to line up around the block in the rain waiting your turn.
 In other words, the second stage of the crisis could erupt in even more dramatic fashion sooner than later. This slow-motion crisis can become a real-time crisis very quickly.
 In addition, the regulatory response is faster because they've seen this movie before. That begs the question of whether regulators are out of bullets because they've already guaranteed almost everything so they don't have more rabbits to pull out of the hat.
 This could be the crisis where the panic moves from the banks to the Dollar itself. If savers lose confidence in the Fed (we're almost there) not only will the banks collapse, but the Dollar will collapse also. At that point, the only solution is gold bullion.
 It's also important to distinguish between individual bank failures and a systemic banking crisis. When individual banks fail, the depositors and creditors are usually protected but stockholders can get wiped out.
 In a systemic banking crisis, the contagion goes from bank to bank quickly, and the entire system has to be rescued with some combination of blanket deposit guarantees and unlimited QE.
 In the worst case, you either have to shut the banks (which FDR did in 1933) or nationalize them which some countries have done from time to time.
 Either a single bank failure or a systemic crisis could happen at any moment. The actual trigger is a bit mysterious and mostly psychological because the fundamental problems have been there all along.
 Well, it seems that the quiet period is over and we are entering Stage II of the banking meltdown.
 New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) had taken huge losses of over $2 billion in February on its commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. It had been teetering on the brink ever since.
 On March 6, it was bailed out with $1 billion of new capital raised by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Ken Griffin's Citadel hedge fund. NYCB may have been bailed out, but it's the canary in the coal mine.
 Its failure means billions more in CRE losses are buried on bank books all over the country.
 The bottom line is Stage II of the crisis is here, and the effects will be devastating to financial institutions and the stock market as a whole.
 We may not be able to prevent the crisis, but we can see it coming and prepare accordingly to preserve our wealth. Step one is to get gold. That will see you through the storm."
2024-03-18,"Title:Cost US Home Ownership Soars. Gold Too
Article:Inflation in housing prices defies high Fed rates...

 HOME-OWNERSHIP is the quintessential American dream, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 But it's become increasingly elusive for many households. A multitude of factors, including soaring home prices, elevated interest rates and persistent inflation, has created the perfect storm, making homeownership a distant reality for more US residents.
 It's impossible to overexaggerate the benefits to owning one's home. In 2022, primary residences accounted for more than a quarter of all assets held by US households, underscoring just how important homeownership is in building long-term wealth.
 But according to analysis conducted by Redfin, a mere 16% of homes for sale in 2023 were considered affordable for the typical US household, the lowest share on record. This stark figure represents a decline from 21% in 2022 and a significant drop from over 40% before the pandemic-fueled homebuying frenzy.
 While the vast majority of renters (81%) aspire to own a home in the future, a staggering 61% are plagued by concerns that they may never realize this dream, according to a new survey conducted this month by the Harris Poll. This sentiment is particularly pronounced among renters, with 57% expressing the belief that the American Dream of homeownership is effectively ""dead,"" compared to 43% of those who already own a home.
 The affordability crisis can be attributed to a multitude of factors, chief among them being the persistent rise in mortgage rates. Despite recent declines from their October peak, rates remain significantly higher than they were in 2022, resulting in a typical homebuyer's monthly payment being approximately $250 more than a year ago, Redfin estimates.
 Moreover, elevated mortgage rates have inadvertently exacerbated the supply crunch, as many homeowners are opting to stay put rather than risk losing their ultra-low rates. This reluctance to sell has bolstered prices as buyers now compete for a limited pool of available properties.
 While some relief may be on the horizon, the path ahead remains uncertain. The Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold off on rate changes, coupled with the potential for future cuts, has introduced a degree of volatility into the market.
 Compounding the challenge is the unexpected surge in wholesale prices in the US, as evidenced by the producer price index (PPI). Prices for manufacturers rose 0.6% month-over-month in February, ahead of expectations, while the consumer price index (CPI) also ticked up from January. This poses fresh obstacles for economic and monetary policy, potentially delaying anticipated rate cuts as the central bank prioritizes curbing inflation over stimulating growth.
 
 Some international financial firms, including UBS and RBC, still anticipate the Fed to start cutting rates as early as its June meeting, with the Bank of Canada, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England potentially following suit in subsequent months.
 But don't expect rates to drop to near-zero anytime soon. Former Fed Chair and current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has cautioned that it's ""unlikely"" that market interest rates will revert to pre-pandemic levels, aligning with projections from the White House and private sector forecasts.
 Against this backdrop, gold has performed very well, touching a new record high of $2195 per ounce. Fueled by growing investor confidence in a potential rate cut and a weakening US Dollar, the yellow metal has surpassed key resistance levels, exhibiting bullish momentum.
 
 As I've written many times, global central bank demand for gold has shown no signs of abating, while a potential rebound in demand from gold-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could provide additional support for the precious metal.
 While the US stock market's solid performance and interest rates above 5% may raise questions about the allure of non-interest-bearing gold, the potential for a reversion in these assets could partially explain the metal's record and near-record-high prices. Historically, wars have been catalysts for gold price appreciation, and the current geopolitical landscape appears to be no exception.
 As investors grapple with the challenges of the current economic landscape, the precious metal's resilience and potential for further gains may offer a glimmer of hope."
2024-03-15,"Title:Money Flows to Power
Article:From Capitalism to Corporatism...

 BACK in the 1990s, it was common to ridicule the government for being technologically backward, writes Jeffrey Tucker in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 We were all gaining access to fabulous things, including the web, apps, search tools and social media. But governments at all levels were stuck in the past using IBM mainframes and large floppy disks.
 I recall the days of thinking government would never catch up to the glories and might of the market itself. I wrote several books on it, full of techno-optimism.
 The new tech sector had a libertarian ethos about it. They didn't care about the government and its bureaucrats. They didn't have lobbyists in Washington. They were the new technologies of freedom and didn't care much about the old analogue world of command and control. They'd usher in a new age of people power.
 Here we sit a quarter-century later with documented evidence that the opposite happened.
 The private sector collects the data that the government buys and uses as a tool of control. It's determined by algorithms agreed upon by a combination of government agencies, university centers, various nonprofits and the companies themselves. The whole thing has become an oppressive blob.
 Alongside Google's new headquarters in Reston, Virginia and Amazon's proposed HQ2 in Arlington, Virginia, every major company that once stayed far away from Washington now owns a similar giant palace in or around DC, and they collect tens of billions in government revenue.
 Government has now become a major customer, if not the main customer, of the services provided by the large social media and tech companies. They're advertisers but also massive purchasers of the main product too.
 Amazon, Microsoft and Google are the biggest winners of government contracts, according to a report from Tussell. Amazon hosts the data of the National Security Agency with a $10 billion contract, and gets hundreds of millions from other governments.
 We don't know how much Google has received from the US government, but it's surely a substantial share of the $694 billion the federal government hands out in contracts.
 Microsoft also has a large share of government contracts. In 2023, the US Department of Defense awarded the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract to Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.
 The contract is worth up to $9 billion and provides the Department of Defense with cloud services. It's just the beginning. The Pentagon is looking for a successor plan that will be bigger.
 Actually, we don't even know the full extent of this but it is gargantuan. Yes, these companies provide the regular consumer services but a main and even decisive customer is government itself.
 As a result, the old laughingstock line about backward tech at government agencies is no more. Today government is a main purchaser of tech services and is a top driver of the AI boom too.
 It's one of the best-kept secrets in American public life, hardly talked about at all by mainstream media. Most people still think of tech companies as free-enterprise rebels. It's not true.
 The same situation of course exists for pharmaceutical companies. This relationship dates even further back in time and is even tighter to the point that there is no real distinction between the interests of the FDA/CDC and large pharmaceutical companies.
 In this framework, we might also tag the agricultural sector, which is dominated by cartels that have driven out family farms. It's a government plan and massive subsidies that determine what is produced and in what quantity.
 It's not because of consumers that your Coke is filled with a scary product called ""high-fructose corn syrup,"" why your candy bar and danish have the same and why there's corn in your gas tank. This is entirely the product of government agencies and budgets.
 In free enterprise, the old rule is that the customer is always right. That's a wonderful system sometimes called consumer sovereignty. Its advent in history, dating perhaps from the 16th century, represented a tremendous advance over the old guild system of feudalism and certainly a major step over ancient despotisms. It's been the rallying cry of market-based economics ever since.
 What happens, however, when government itself becomes a main and even dominant customer?
 The ethos of private enterprise is thereby changed. No longer primarily interested in serving the general public, enterprise turns its attention to serving its powerful masters in the halls of the state, gradually weaving close relationships and forming a ruling class that becomes a conspiracy against the public.
 This used to go by the name ""crony capitalism"", which perhaps describes some of the problems on a small scale. This is another level of reality that needs an entirely different name. That name is corporatism, a coinage from the 1930s and a synonym for fascism back before that became a curse word due to wartime alliances.
 Corporatism is a specific thing, not capitalism and not socialism but a system of private property ownership with cartelized industry that primarily serves the state.
 The old binaries of the public and private sector – widely assumed by every main ideological system – have become so blurred that they no longer make much sense. And yet we're ideologically and philosophically unprepared to deal with this new world with anything like intellectual insight.
 Not only that, it can be extremely difficult even to tell the good guys from the bad guys in the news stream. We hardly know anymore for whom to cheer or boo in the great struggles of our time.
 That's how mixed up everything has become. We've clearly traveled a long way from the 1990s!
 Of course in 1913, we saw the advent of a particularly egregious public-private partnership with the Federal Reserve, in which private banks merged into a unified front and agreed to service US government debt obligations in exchange for bailout guarantees. This monetary corporatism continues to vex us to this day, as does the military-industrial complex.
 How is it different from the past? It's different in degree and reach.
 The corporatist machine now manages the main products and services in our civilian life including the entire way we get information, how we work, how we bank, how we contact friends and how we buy.
 It's the manager of the whole of our lives in every respect, and has become the driving force of product innovation and design. It's become a tool for surveillance in the most intimate aspects of our lives, including financial information and listening devices we've willingly installed in our own homes.
 It's become a main curator and censor of our news and social media presence and postings. It is in a position to say which companies and products succeed and which ones fail. It can kill apps in a flash if the well-placed person does not like what they are doing.
 It can order other apps to add or subtract to a blacklist based on political opinions. It can tell even the smallest company to comply or face death by lawfare. It can seize on any individual and make him a public enemy based entirely on an opinion or action that runs contrary to regime priorities.
 In short, this corporatism – in all its iterations including the regulatory state and the patent war chest that maintains and enforces monopoly – is the core source of all the current despotism.
 It obtained its first full trial run with the lockdowns of 2020, when tech companies and media joined in the ear-splitting propaganda campaigns to shelter in place, cancel holidays and not visit Grandma in the hospital and nursing home.
 It cheered as millions of small businesses were destroyed and big-box stores thrived as distributors of approved products, while vast swaths of the workforce were called nonessential and put on welfare.
 This was the corporatist state at work, with a large corporate sector wholly acquiescent to regime priority and a government fully dedicated to rewarding its industrial partners in every sector that went along with the political priority at the moment.
 The trigger for the construction of the vast machinery that rules our lives was far back in time and always begins the same way: with a seemingly inauspicious government contract.
 How well I recall those days in the 1990s when public schools first started to buy computers from Microsoft. Did alarm bells go off? Not for me. I had a typical attitude of any pro-business libertarian: Whatever business wants to do, it should do.
 Surely it's up to the enterprise to sell to all willing buyers, even if that includes governments. In any case, how in the world would one prevent this? Government contracting with private business has been the norm from time immemorial. No harm done.
 And yet it turns out that vast harm was done. This was just the beginning of what became one of the world's largest industries, far more powerful and decisive over industrial organization than old-fashioned producer-to-consumer markets.
 These gigantic for-profit and public trading corporations became the operational foundation of the surveillance-driven corporatist complex.
 We're nowhere near coming to terms with the implications of this. It goes way beyond and fully transcends the old debates between capitalism and socialism. Indeed, that is not what this is about.
 The focus on that might be theoretically interesting but it has little or no relevance to the current reality in which public and private have fully merged and intruded into every aspect of our lives, and with fully predictable results: economic decline for the many and riches for the few.
 This is also why neither the left nor the right, nor Democrats or Republicans, nor capitalists or socialists, seem to be speaking clearly to the moment in which we live.
 The dominating force on both the national and global scene today is techno-corporatism that intrudes itself into our food, our medicine, our media, our information flows, our homes and all the way down to the hundreds of surveillance tools that we carry around in our pockets.
 I truly wish these companies were genuinely private, but they're not. They're de facto state actors. More precisely, they all work hand-in-glove and which is the hand and which is the glove is no longer clear.
 Coming to terms with this intellectually is the major challenge of our times. Dealing with it juridically and politically seems like a much more daunting task, to say the least. The problem is complicated by the drive to purge serious dissent at all levels of society.
 How did American capitalism become American corporatism? A little at a time and then all at once."
2024-03-08,"Title:Blow-Off Top in Gold? Price Hits New Record High 5 Days Running
Article:Is this dramatic? Does it mean gold price is topping...?


              
           


The PRICE of GOLD set another fresh all-time high at Friday morning's big precious metal auction in London, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             That makes it a run of 5 days for new record gold prices at the global bullion market's daily benchmark. Gold today also set a 5th consecutive day of record highs in Shanghai too, taking the wholesale bullion price 5.0% higher in just 1 week for the precious metal's No.1 mining, importing, consumer and 
            central-bank gold buying nation.
           

              
           




              
           

             Who's driving this jump? Why now? And what does analysis of the history of dramatic jumps in gold suggest might come next for the bullion investment price?
           

              
           
 Western gold investment

             First, make no mistake: There is no gold rush among Western investors right now, not in physical bullion and not outside leveraged betting through futures and options contracts.
           

              
           

             Gold ETFs such as the giant GLD and IAU continue to shrink, now back to pre-pandemic size. Coin shops are cutting both their premiums and buy-back prices to try stemming and clearing the flood of customer selling. BullionVault users have now 
            taken profit in gold net-net as a group for a record 6 months running.
           

              
           
 Gold futures and options

             In contrast, trading in gold derivatives has suddenly switched very bullish, having been very muted early last week. Net of bearish bets, the bullish position among 'Managed Money' traders (on data from US regulators the CFTC) was 25% smaller than its 2023 average and only two-thirds its average size (65%) of the past 10 years.
           

              
           

             We won't know this week's long/short data until this evening. But on average since last Friday, data from the CME derivatives exchange says that the daily trading volume in Comex gold futures has jumped 68.0% from its daily average across the previous 3 months. In options contracts (which are more leveraged, more speculative, more risky) it's leapt by 102.2%, setting the highest daily average since mid-October (when gold prices rebounded from sudden multi-month lows) and coming within 5% of its highest since the all-time records of March 2020 (when the Covid crisis spurred 
            record-heavy Western gold investment).
           

              
           

             This week's jump in the speed and size of Comex trading suggests that one or more hedge funds or other hot-money speculators – wanting to bet on a recovery in US Fed rate-cut expectations – decided that gold options offered the biggest delta. So far, that looks a smart bet, and it contrasts sharply with continued profit-taking in vaulted bullion investment as well as the outflows from US and European ETFs backed by gold.
           

              
           

             (
            What about 'short-covering' driving the price jump, as some analysts suggest? Speculators as a group weren't wildly bullish gold on last week's CFTC data, but they were net long as a group. More plainly, gross short positions were not excessive by any measure. The Managed Money category on Tues 27th Feb's figures held total short positions in futures and options 10% below the 2023 average and 14% smaller than the 10-year average.)
           

              
           
 Physical gold outside the West

             Underpinning the surge in gold investing prices, note that the physical-market benchmarks in both Shanghai (entry-point into China, gold's No.1 consumer market) and in London (heart of the world's gold bullion storage and trading network) have risen rather than fallen as options trading has jumped.
           

              
           

             Indeed, the spot price has repeatedly risen around London's 3pm auction (including into Thursday afternoon's fresh record), suggesting stronger demand to invest than supply at the opening price and thereby needing a higher price to curb demand and boost selling to find the final clearing level.
           

              
           

             Yes, some of that demand at the benchmark auctions will have come from bullion banks and brokerages needing gold to match their exposure to client derivatives positions. But crucially, physical demand in India and most especially in 
            gold's key consumer market of China continues to run strong, and central-bank demand for gold also remains historically hot, again led by emerging market nations in 'the Rest' rather than 'the West'.
           

              
           

             That's clearly been supporting and helping drive up the gold price, breaking 
            the more typical pattern of Asian households and central banks acting as price takers, buying the dips and turning cautious on strong gains. China's latest official purchases (another 12 tonnes in February, the 16th consecutive month of reported accumulation) confirm its position as the world's No.1 central-bank gold buyer. But many other sovereign nations are also favouring the precious metal as a safe haven, as a way to invest against the worsening geopolitical outlook.
           

              
           
 Short-term gold price outlook

             Looking ahead, the speed of gold's move and the size of the gains made by options traders this week could see speculators join physical investors in taking profit – and those physical bullion owners have only increased the pace of their profit taking as the price has jumped higher.
           

              
           

             That will, of course, add more supply to the global bullion market, potentially weighing on prices. What's more, and because gold pays no income, these new all-time price highs could also be vulnerable to dropping back if central banks – led by the US Fed – now commit to holding interest rates higher for longer to try keeping a lid on inflation. That would cool the speculative heat in Comex futures and options which has clearly lit this sudden fire beneath gold prices this week.
           

              
           

             But a pull-back isn't guaranteed for the gold price, not given the dreadful mood music from geopolitics, and any dip could prove good opportunity to buy into the precious metal's underlying strength. Indeed, with the boom in US tech stocks increasingly described as a bubble while Moscow and Nato talk openly about the threat of direct conflict, Western portfolios have started to look overweight risk and underweight insurance.
           

              
           

             So while private-investor gold demand in Europe and North America will likely remain weak until cash interest rates start to fall, strategic allocations to gold among portfolio managers may start to rebound before the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England make their first cut. 
           

              
           
 How unusual is this gold-price surge?

             Gold on Thursday set its 4th new London PM benchmark record in a row at $2153.45. Based on that figure, and in US Dollar terms, gold has now risen by:
           

              
           

 Week-on-week 5.2%
 1-month change 5.5%
 13-week change 5.8%
 1 year change 17.9%


              
           

             Unusual? Short term, yes. Gold's move has been dramatic, reflecting the sudden jump in speculative bullishness. Week-to-week, that rise of 5.2% comes in the top 3% of all weekly moves since 1969 (including price drops).
           

              
           

             But on average, weekly gains of this size (between 5.0% and 5.5% in US Dollar terms) have been followed by 1-month gains of 2.4% mean and 1.2% median across the past 55 years; looking at just the past 2 decades, such rises then saw 1-month gains of 0.5% mean and 1.3% median in the Dollar gold price.
           

              
           




              
           

             Moreover, and compared with the big historic peaks in the gold price, today's move doesn't look anything like the 'blow-off' tops which have marked multi-year highs in the past.
           

              
           

             Yes, this week has seen fireworks. But it's come from a strong and solid base, rather than off relentless firework gains across the past month, quarter or year.
           

              
           
 Gold's previous runs of record-high prices

             Over the past 55 years, and before Thursday this week, gold at the London 3pm benchmark had set a new record...
           

              
           

 3 days running on 78 of all trading days (ie, some of them are included in longer runs)
 4 days 33 times 
 5 days 15 times
 6 days 4 times
 7 days just once


              
           

             Drilling into gold-price history, this week's jump – coming as expectations for Fed rates have eased back while sword-rattling between Moscow and Nato has worsened and the dreadful conflicts in both Ukraine and Gaza continue – matches the pattern of previous 5-day runs of new record highs. Because all of which came during periods of financial, monetary or geopolitical stress.
           

              
           

             April 1969, for instance, saw bullion prices rise on heavy private-investment demand for gold amid growing rumours and speculation that the USA would abandon its $35/oz peg following the collapse of the US-European central banks' 'London gold pool' the previous March. (It had sold huge quantities of national bullion reserves into the private market to try putting a lid on the price.) The US would finally 
            abandon the Dollar's gold peg with the 'Nixon Shock' of August 1971.
           

              
           

             But of the 15 distinct periods for 5-day record highs in the gold price (spring 1969, New Year and spring 1972, spring + summer 1973, New Year 1974, autumn 1978, autumn 1979, New Year + spring 2008, autumn 2009, autumn 2010, spring + summer 2011, summer 2020) only 3 came close to what proved a longer-term peak. October 1979 was followed by gold setting what became a 2-decade peak at $850 on 21 Jan 1980; August 2011 saw gold peak at $1895 on 6 Sept; late-July 2020 saw gold peak on 6 August at $2067.
           

              
           
 What about longer runs of new record gold prices?

             May 1973 saw gold set a 6-day run of record highs as oil prices (and inflation) surged amid a threat that Saudi Arabia would impose an embargo on exports to the US because of its support for Israel. (The embargo then came in October.)
           

              
           

             July 2020 also saw a 6-day run as social unrest grew against pandemic lockdowns and governments everywhere unleashed yet more record fiscal and monetary stimulus amid the first-wave Covid Catastrophe.
           

              
           
 Gold's record 7-day run of new all-time highs

             This came in 2008, running from Jan 7th ($859) to 15th ($913) as the global financial crisis accelerated. Global stock markets were falling hard, and the US Fed promised to keep cutting interest rates as panic gripped banking shares and bonds.
           

              
           

             The crisis grew until Bear Stearns was rescued by the US authorities (and got taken over by J.P.Morgan) on 14th March. That same day, gold made its first all-time high above $1000. It wouldn't set its final GFC high for another 3 years.
           

              
           

             What next for the price of gold?
           

             We don't make price forecasts at BullionVault. As a trading exchange, we earn a (very small) commission whether customers buy or sell, so it wouldn't be right or fair to our users. 
           

              
           

             But as a group, and in US Dollar terms, private investors using BullionVault's simple, secure and low-cost marketplace at the end of 2023 gave 
            a 2024 gold price forecast for bullion to finish this year at $2342 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             That would mark a rise of 12.7% from the final London 3pm benchmark of last year...which might have sounded overly bullish at New Year. Indeed, that year-end prediction from users of BullionVault was higher than the highest high predicted across 2024 by all but one of the 25 professional analysts entering this year's 
            LBMA Forecast Survey.
           

              
           

             Chantelle Schieven, head of research, Capitalight Research, predicted an annual average of $2170 with a peak of $2405 and a low of $1935. But the average annual forecast by all those 25 analysts as a group was just $2059 per Troy ounce, only $20 above what gold has now averaged so far in 2024. And a year-end rise of 12.7% – as forecast by private individual choosing to invest in gold using BullionVault – wouldn't be unusual. Gold in Dollars has risen by more than that in 30 of the past 55 years, including 5 times in the past decade.
           

              
           
 Bottom line for gold prices today?

             Despite making a run of new all-time highs this week, gold is very far from a crowded trade, never mind a bubble. While the past few days look dramatic, and while the sudden jump in hot-money betting on gold derivatives will naturally burn itself out, the underlying uptrend remains steady, almost boring in fact compared with Bitcoin tripling over the past 12 months or against the big gains in equities led by US tech stocks.
           

              
           

             That might explain why Western investors continue to stay shy of gold coins, small bullion bars and 
            gold ETFs like the GLD and IAU, taking profit as a group overall rather than buying the precious metal right now. But long-term bull markets aren't built by repeatedly grabbing the headlines, and if you view gold as a form of investment insurance – which is how the vast majority of private and professional investors holding gold see it – the best time to buy is before it matters, when other financial markets are doing well and there isn't a rush into the 'safe haven' metal.
           

              
           

             And what this week's price pop driven by options betting really shows is how, when Western investors do return to buying gold – whether on cuts to cash interest rates, deeper economic and banking stress, or a worsening of geopolitical tensions and conflict – the precious metal's long-term and ongoing bull market is very likely to keep running higher."

Article:4x men's growth in 'long-term reliable investment...'


              
           


""EVERYTHING's changed since Covid,"" 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             That's how one woman choosing to use BullionVault since 2020 explains her decision to start investing in gold.
           

              
           

             She's far from alone. The rise in female investors 
            buying gold bullion since the pandemic began 4 years ago has been remarkable.
           

              
           

             This trend is global, and it's accelerating.
           

              
           
 Women as % of new precious metals investors

              
           

Source: BullionVault


              
           

             The Covid Crisis saw 
            a record number of people buy gold for investment. But while the pace of growth has eased back overall, women continue to make up a greater share of new buyers.
           

              
           

             In fact, since the Covid Crisis began at the start of 2020, the number of women choosing to use BullionVault's platform to put money into gold for the first time has grown by 116% compared to the previous 4-year period. That outpaces growth in the number of new male users, at 28% worldwide, more than four times over.
           

              
           

             The trend for women to invest in gold is happening across all of BullionVault's major markets, as the data in our table above shows.
           

              
           

             Over the past 4 years – and with the pandemic followed by the worst inflation in four decades, plus Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the return of banking stresses and failure in the USA, and now the Hamas-Israel war spilling into the Red Sea – BullionVault has seen female investors account for more than 25% of its new users worldwide, up from below 17% of 2016-2019's new intake. Across 2023 alone, that figure rose to 29%.
           

              
           

             This switch over the past 4 years marks a much greater proportion for female vs. male 
            gold investors than during the global financial crisis, and it contrasts sharply with the pre-Covid period as well.
           

              
           

             Something is different, in other words, about the 2020s so far. Women are now choosing to buy gold for investment in a way that they didn't when Northern Rock or Lehman's failed 15 years ago, or when the Eurozone debt crisis threatened to crash the single currency a decade ago, or when Brexit and then Trump shook UK and US politics in 2016 as the migrant crisis continued to shake the European Union.
           

              
           

             Is this trend being seen in other investments and asset classes? A survey for brokerage and fund management firm Fidelity in 2021 said that two-thirds of women in the USA were now investing money on top of their workplace retirement savings plans, up from below 1-in-2 three years earlier. Half of women answering that survey also said they'd become ""more interested in investing"" since the start of the pandemic in 2020.
           

              
           

             But rather than reporting what people say to market-research surveys asking about their money, the trend at BullionVault is shown by hard data from our client base. It also marks a jump in allocations to a 'safe haven' investment – one which tends to gain appeal among all investors and savers when the economy stumbles and other assets do poorly.
           

              
           

             Of course, everyone has personal reasons for reaching the financial decisions they make. But when asked what led them to choose gold, female customers of BullionVault have repeatedly used words such as:
           

              
           

 ""Mistrust"" whether of government, central banks, the financial industry or the social/economic system more widely;
 ""Inflation"" in the cost of living, ""debasement"" and ""devaluation"" of currency;
 ""Unsustainable debts"" facing Western economies;
 Wanting to ""diversify"" their other investments, spreading risk overall, especially versus shares;
 ""Uncertainty"" and ""crisis"".


              
           

             Against those challenges, women using BullionVault to invest in gold since the start of the pandemic say that the precious metal offers ""security...stability...protection...preservation of value.""
           

              
           

             Do men see the gold differently or use other words to discuss it? In our experience, no. The same issues and concerns are raised by BullionVault's male customers, too. Again however, the number of men choosing to buy gold hasn't risen anything like as fast as the number of women over the past 4 years.
           

              
           





               
            


             No doubt every age in history felt uncertain at the time, if not turbulent.
           

              
           

             But the 2020s began with governments worldwide imposing the most sudden and aggressive interventions of any peacetime period into our personal and economic lives. Now this decade continues to deliver what feel like ever-more epochal shifts and shocks to the economy, personal finances, investment markets, social cohesion and political order.
           

              
           

             Women using BullionVault tell us that such uncertainties are the drivers for them acting to diversify their investments, spreading risk in their portfolio and retirement savings with an allocation to securely stored precious metals led by gold."
2024-03-05,"Title:Record Gold Price? Western Investing Shrinks 6th Month Running
Article:Gold $2100 draws out yet more profit-taking...


              
           


GOLD INVESTMENT across Western economies continues to run negative by weight, with owners taking profits on gold as the price trades at new all-time highs, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault.


              
           

             With the boom in US tech stocks increasingly described as a bubble while Moscow and Nato talk openly about the threat of direct conflict, Western portfolios have started to look overweight risk and underweight insurance.
           

              
           

             Yet 'safe haven' bullion's latest all-time highs have come amid a lack of demand to invest in gold from Western households and fund managers. Private investors using BullionVault – more than 9-in-10 of whom live in North America or Western Europe – have now been net sellers of gold for 6 months running, taking profit and rebalancing their portfolios as the precious metal hits new record prices.
           

              
           

             Net of customer demand, BullionVault users have sold 1.6 tonnes of gold since their holdings set a peak above 48.2 tonnes at the end of August, raising $104 million (£85m, €99m).
           

              
           

             But while customers holdings – all securely vaulted and insured in each client's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or most popular Zurich – have shrunk 3.4% by weight over that time, with 0.3 tonnes sold in February, the price of gold has risen by 8.0% in US Dollar terms (7.9% in both UK Pounds and Euros).
           

              
           

             That has taken the value of those gold bullion investment holdings 4.1% higher to a fresh all-time record on Monday above $3.1 billion (up 4.0% in both UK Pounds and Euros to £2.4bn and €2.8bn respectively).
           

              
           




              
           

             As the price of gold slipped across February before surging to new all-time daily highs at the start of March, the number of gold buyers on BullionVault retreated 10.4% last month from 
            January's 3-month high on Gold Investor Index data, while the number of sellers rose 9.2% from its 4-month low.
           

              
           

             Together, that cut the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of sentiment built solely on actual trading behaviour in physical bullion, on which any reading below 50.0 would signal sellers outnumbering buyers – by 0.9 points to 51.5, its weakest February reading in 14 years.
           

              
           

             Will gold now hold or run to new record prices? Because gold pays no income, these new all-time highs could be vulnerable to central banks led by the US Fed holding interest rates higher for longer to try keeping a lid on inflation. But while a pull-back isn't guaranteed, any dip could prove good opportunity to buy into the underlying strength in gold.
           

              
           

             Although gold's latest run to new record highs has come on a jump in speculative betting, physical 
            demand for gold from the key consumer markets of China and India continues to run hot. 
            Central-bank demand for gold also remains historically strong, and that's clearly helping drive up the gold price as sovereign nations favour the precious metal as a safe haven against the worsening geopolitical outlook.
           

              
           




              
           

             With silver prices declining in Dollars, Euros and UK Pounds across last month, the recent pattern of buying the dips, selling the peaks would have suggested a rise in silver bullion demand.
           

              
           

             Yet February saw the number of silver buyers on BullionVault drop by more than one third, down 36.5% to the fewest since November. The number of sellers in contrast rose 20.4% from January's 11-month low.
           

              
           

             Together that pulled the Silver Investor Index down by 3.1 points to 50.1, indicating that buyers outnumbered sellers by only a very small margin.
           

              
           

             Trading activity in silver was also very nearly balanced in terms of weight, with selling across February topping demand by 0.1 tonnes to leave BullionVault user holdings just below 1,230 tonnes, 1.3% larger than December's 31-month low."
2024-02-23,"Title:China's Loss, Mexico's Gain
Article:China no longer No.1 supplier of goods to USA...

 A LITTLE OVER a year ago, the world watched as China reopened its doors after three long years of strict pandemic lockdowns, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Expectations were high for a robust economic recovery, fueled by pent-up demand and consumer spending.
 The reality has been starkly different. Despite a bustling travel season around China's Lunar New Year – with a record 9 billion domestic trips expected, 80 million by air – the anticipated economic rebound has largely failed to materialize, even as world markets have surged to record to near-record highs.
 This downturn appears not to be just a temporary blip, but a sign of deeper structural issues within the Chinese economy. The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) reportedly grew 5.2% in 2023, an admirable print at first glance, but it masks underlying challenges. A closer look reveals a significant slowdown from the pre-pandemic era of consistent +6% growth.
 Select industries such as electric vehicles (EVs) saw remarkable sales in China last year, but this strength hasn't been enough to offset serious weaknesses in other sectors, particularly real estate, which remains a major drag on the economy.
 
 Our decision to close the China Region Fund last year was a move predicated on recognizing early signs of these economic challenges. It's a decision that, in hindsight, has been vindicated.
 The ongoing property sector slump and regulatory uncertainties have further exacerbated investor apprehension, leading to a significant outflow of $68.7 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) for the first time since 2018.
 Chinese equities continue to underperform. Both mainland stocks and those listed in Hong Kong ended 2023 with losses, even as other Asia-Pacific markets rallied. Remarkably, Japan's Nikkei 225 is poised to hit a new all-time high after 34 years.
 
 This year isn't off to a great start for Chinese stocks, either. The CSI 300 shed over 7% in January, while the Hang Seng lost over 9%.
 ""China seems to be divorced from the rest of the world,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Bloomberg. ""Part of the lack of equity response is that the global economy is doing OK without China.""
 Indeed, in a shift not seen in over 20 years, Mexico outpaced China last year to become the top supplier of imports to the US This change highlights the escalating strains between Washington and Beijing, alongside American initiatives to source more goods from closer, more allied nations.
 
 Recent data from the Commerce Department indicates that imports from Mexico to the US increased nearly 5% from 2022 to 2023, reaching over $475 billion. Conversely, the import value from China saw a sharp decline of 20%, falling to $427 billion.
 Efforts to stabilize the Chinese market have so far failed to lift investor confidence. Last Tuesday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced plans to halt the practice of brokerages borrowing shares to lend them out and to limit the scope of what's referred to as the securities re-lending market, in a move aimed at reining in short-selling activities.
 This came a day after the regulator vowed ""zero tolerance"" against short sellers, warning them they could ""lose their shirts and rot in jail,"" according to reporting by Reuters.
 These regulatory steps were introduced after the Chinese government declared in October 2023 that it would issue 1 trillion Yuan ($140 billion) in Chinese Government Bonds (CGB) to support local government finances and fund infrastructure projects in areas affected by natural disasters over the past year.
 The move was meant to send a signal to global markets that China is ""pro-growth"" again, but as Morgan Stanley's Schuyler Hooper writes, the strategy is seen as ""merely a repeat of China's old policy playbook, where they rely on investment to prop up 'economic' growth, while growth in consumption, export, property and private investment remains sluggish.""
 The risk, Hooper points out, ""is a short-lived cyclical rebound amid a longer-term secular slowdown"" in the Chinese market.
 The Chinese government faces a daunting task in addressing the deep-seated issues within its economy. Chaos in the real estate market, local government debt and deflationary pressures are significant hurdles to sustained growth. Geopolitical tensions add another layer of complexity.
 The situation serves as a reminder of the importance of diversification and the need to remain agile. I believe it's more important than ever to rely on sound investment principles and a diversified portfolio."
2024-02-22,"Title:Gold in Yen Hits New Record as Nikkei Finally Beats 1989 Bubble Top
Article:Japan gold price up 430% since 1989 stock-market peak...


              
           


The PRICE of GOLD BULLION recorded a run of new all-time high for Japanese investors this week as the Tokyo stock market finally topped its 'bubble economy' peak, set on the final trading day of 1989.
           

              
           

             Trading at ¥9790 per gram around London's 3pm fix on Thursday – the global benchmark for physical bullion – the gold price in JPY has risen by 430% since the Nikkei 225 share-price index set what proved to be a 34-year high.
           

              
           

             Across the last 5 decades, that puts the Nikkei and 
            gold priced in Yen virtually neck and neck in terms of gains for Japanese investors and savers, rising 811% and 818% respectively since the start of 1974.
           

              
           




              
           

             The second-largest economy in 1989 behind the USA, Japan last year slipped into 4th position measured in Dollars as its gross domestic product fell further behind China and 
            was overtaken by Germany – itself now in recession – thanks to the Yen dropping 6.4% versus the US currency.
           

              
           

             Falling for the 3rd year running, the Yen in 2023 reached its cheapest FX exchange rate since 1990 as Western central banks – led by the US Federal Reserve – all 
            raised their interest rates in the face of strong inflation.
           

              
           

             But while Japan's core cost of living rose by 3.1% last year, the 
            fastest inflation in more than 4 decades, the central bank in Tokyo stuck with the low and then negative interest-rate and QE bond-buying policies it has applied since the 125-million citizen nation slid into 
            a post-bubble recession and then deflation in the 1990s.
           

              
           

             ""The erosion of Yen value 
            has prompted a revaluation [of gold in JPY],"" says Bruce Ikemizu, formerly head of precious metals at the Tokyo branch of Chinese-South African bullion bank ICBC Standard, and now director of the Japan Bullion Market Association.
           

              
           

             ""An increasing number of investors [are] viewing gold as a hedge against both inflation and yen depreciation.""
           

              
           

             The BoJ 
            will finally end its negative-rate policy at its meeting in April according to 4-in-5 economists polled by Reuters today. Most of those also believe it will also finally abandon what remains of its 
            'yield curve control' program in Japanese government bonds as well.
           

              
           

             ""Older generations traditionally favoured the safety of bank deposits,"" says Ikemizu – winner of the 2023 gold price forecast competition held by the London Bullion Market Association – but having been ""the primary buyers of gold in the 1980s and 1990s, [now they] are exiting the scene and selling their gold.""
           

              
           

             This extends the pattern of 
            net gold selling by Japanese investors seen since the early 2000s, when a steep rise in bullion prices worldwide first triggered heavy profit-taking. Those outflows saw additional selling in the mid-2010s after a change in 
            Japan's VAT sales tax rules encouraged gangsters to buy bullion coins and small bars in neighboring Korea, smuggle them home, and sell them to domestic retailers – earning an 8% tax rebate on top of the sale price – with the unwanted metal finding its way back to the global market.
           

              
           




              
           

             While 
            Japan's VAT-scam gold smuggling has subsided following a government crackdown, ""a younger demographic, largely unaffected by historical gold prices, is entering the market"" to invest in bullion, says Ikemizu.
           

              
           

             ""Even with gold prices in Yen reaching unprecedented levels, there is a surprising absence of a surge in selling from gold holders.""
           

              
           

             Alongside Thursday's fresh record high in Yen gold prices, the Nikkei 225 share index closed Tokyo trade at 39,098 points, rising as global stock markets gained following a strong earnings report from AI chipmaker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVD) and closing some 0.5% above its prior record.
           

              
           

             With NVDA almost tripling in price from this point last year, New York's Nasdaq 100 index of tech stocks has now risen 49.3% over the past 12 months. The Nikkei rose 28.9% in the Japanese 'bubble' year topping out on 29 December 1989.
           

              
           

             Over the following 2 decades, the Nikkei 225 would lose 82% of its nominal value, almost matching gold's 86% drop in Yen terms over the 20 years following its peak of January 1980.
           

              
           

             Including corporate dividends, the 
            Nikkei Total Returns Index topped its 'Tokyo Bubble' peak in early 2020, back when the price index was still 30% below its 1989 high."

TRIP to Frankfurt, Germany last week for work, 
            says Adrian Ash at BullionVault in this quick tour of central banks around the world, first shared with BullionVault users in the Weekly Update.


              
           

             Nice city. Great opera house. Lovely schnitzels. 
            Weird cider.
           

              
           

             I stayed next to the headquarters of the European Central Bank. So after a meeting in town, I walked back along the banks of the River Main to get a view of the ECB building from pretty much every angle.
           

              
           

             Because, well, it's odd.
           

              
           




              
           

             As my tourist snaps show from beneath that grey sky, almost as heavy as the German economy, the ECB tower...
           

              
           

             ...throbbing heart of Euro interest rates and monetary policy for 350 million people across 20 countries, but empty of any staff last week from what I could see...
           

              
           

             ...stands all by itself in the quiet Frankfurt suburb of Ostend.
           

              
           

             That sets it apart from every other central-bank building I've ever seen. Because they're usually squeezed into the city centre, with an entrance straight off the street (or maybe reached by a grand footpath) rather than standing alone in a large, flat, grassy park edged with high metal fencing, security gates and cameras.
           

              
           

             As you can also see above, the ECB never quite looks like the same building twice.
           

              
           

             Walk around it, and each view looks like a different office block, as though the central banking shape-shifter is caught between 3 or 4 glass-clad versions of its boring glass-clad self.
           

              
           

             That's because, 
            as the ECB said when its policymakers chose the design in January 2005 (they had nothing else to do that day, leaving interest rates unchanged like they had for 17 months before and would do again for the next 10 months too), ""the high-rise building consists of two polygonal office towers connected by an atrium.""
           

              
           

             The winning design came from Vienna architects Coop Himmelb(l)au. (No, the brackets aren't a typo. The firm is ""not a color but an idea"" 
            apparently ""of creating architecture with fantasy, as buoyant and variable as clouds""). And twisting the 2 towers together ""satisfies two important elements of the competition brief,"" said the ECB when picking that shape, ""namely that the new premises should 'foster interactive communication' and 'promote teamwork'.""
           

              
           

             So far, so ugh.
           

              
           

             But up close (well, as close as you can get to the empty scrubland surrounding the base) and viewed from the east...
           

              
           

             ...away from the main-road vehicle entrance on Sonnemannstrasse (and nearer to 
            the Grossmarkthalle memorial to the 10,000 Jewish people rounded up in Frankfurt by the Nazis and sent to their deaths between 1941 and 1945)...
           

              
           

             ...the 185-metre tower finally reveals its true form...
           

              
           

             ...the scary black obelisk from the cover of Led Zeppelin's 1976 album, 
            Presence.
           

              
           




              
           

             Designed by '70s marketing firm Hipgnosis, the gatefold sleeve for 
            Presence featured 'The Object' in a series of photos...
           

              
           

             ""...pictures torn out of National Geographic magazines from the 1950s"" in fact, 
            according to the artist Aubrey Powell.
           

              
           

             ""We just painted in black that exact shaped object with 
            ordinary people in ordinary situations. In other words: This was something you needed to live. It was food. It was a symbol of energy, of power. Which is what Led Zeppelin were.""
           

              
           

             Was this the model for the ECB tower? Is that what it says about the European Central Bank? That it's vital, essential, omnipresent, all powerful?
           

              
           

             Neither 
            Zeppelin nor Hipgnosis get a mention in any of the PR, news or reviews I can find around the ECB tower. Nor do most of the journalists and fans 
            writing about Presence on the internet mention ""the other thing about the black Thing"" either...
           

              
           

             ...the fact that ""It's clearly evil"" as one comment puts it.
           

              
           

             Occult most certainly (a big theme for guitar hero Jimmy Page), it's very possibly alien, like the obelisk in 
            2001: A Space Odyssey. Or perhaps it's 
            simply surreal. Either way, The Object's presence among those ""ordinary people"" in ""ordinary situations"" has always felt threatening going on terrifying to me.
           

              
           

             Savers in the Eurozone might agree.
           

              
           

             The ECB has repeatedly paid a lower rate of interest than the pace of inflation since the Euro came into being on 1 January 1999. (Indeed, it even 
            paid a lower rate of interest than 0% for 8 years starting in 2014!) That has turned €10,000 into less than €7,500 in real purchasing terms, with most of the harm done since the tower was topped out a decade ago.
           

              
           

             How's that for black magick?
           

              
           




              
           

             It's now almost 50 years since The Object appeared on the cover of Presence, 20 years since the ECB chose the same shape for its towering lair, and 10 years since the glass-clad ""thing"" was completed.
           

              
           

             Yet the tower's blank stare remains ""a modern building for a modern central bank"" to 
            quote the ECB's own website.
           

              
           

             Again, that makes the tower very different from most of its counterparts among the rest of the world's reserve currencies and also-rans. Because the ECB is almost alone in not trying to look like something from ancient Greece, renaissance Italy, or aristocrat Europe.
           

              
           

             Take the Marriner S.Eccles building in Washington DC, for instance. Built to the design of French 'Beaux-Arts' architect Paul Philippe Cret almost a century ago, it houses the Federal Reserve Board inside 
            the white marble and sturdy columns of a classical temple.
           

              
           

             A very 1930s' temple to be sure...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...and much more like a massive and threatening art deco cinema, shopping mall or even 
            government bullion vault than the 18th Century country pile designed at the same time by Herbert Baker for the Bank of England in the City of London.
           

              
           

             That was finished in 1939, two years later than the Eccles Building (and just in time for the Luftwaffe to try flattening it) with 
            fluted columns and a giant portico.
           

              
           

             But Cret's ""stripped classical"" style for the US Fed still centres on a huge door, reached by a wide flight of steps, which is almost lost in a massive frontage that bellows 'Ancient temple! Greek gods at work!'
           

              
           

             So too, weirdly, does 
            the Bank of Japan in Tokyo. Designed and built in the 1890s, the home of the Yen was conceived by architect Tatsuno Kingo on trips to Belgium, the USA and England, where he regularly went to survey the Bank of England's 
            genuinely 18th Century manifestation, designed by John Soanes and finished after 40 years' work in 1833.
           

              
           

             The BoJ thus mimicked its Western peers like Emperor 
            Hirohito wearing a morning suit and starched collar. And to do that, it echoed Ancient Greece.
           

              
           

             ""Order and dignity are expressed in the classical exterior of the building,"" says the Bank of Japan about its main building today.
           

              
           

             ""The colonnade on the ground floor of the courtyard is in the Doric style, while the coupled columns extending from the second to third floors of the façade, courtyard, and west side of the building are Corinthian.""
           

              
           

             Outside today's rich-world economies, a similar story. 
           

              
           

             The Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai was built in 1980, yet it channels the US Fed's 1930s temple in Washington more than anything else, with 
            a couple of classical columns thrown in for good measure either side of the huge entrance.
           

              
           

             China's central bank of course 
            tends more towards ""Communist chic"". But even here (and with zero history available online that I can find) the PBoC's curved headquarters loom so large and monumental that the roundtable discussions inside are clearly open only to the very highest officials, the unelected elite.
           

              
           

             More classical columns adorn the front of the 
            Central Bank of Russia's HQ in Moscow, but heavy dollops of wedding-cake trim and light yellow paint make it a Romanov palace above all else.
           

              
           

             And why not? The next best style after Ancient Greek temples for running a country's money is ""aristocrat bling"" as the Bank of England has shown for almost 3 centuries...
           

              
           

             ...never mind 
            the Banque de France in Paris...
           

              
           

             ...both ruling high above the mob, if not quite so high and powerful as gods and goddesses.
           

              
           

             Such a pity, then, when the spell is broken.
           

              
           

             ""It's a great business to be in, central banking,"" joked Adrian Orr, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to lawmakers in Wellington last week.
           

              
           

             ""You print money and people believe in it!""
           

              
           

             Cue 
            much chuckling from Orr and his fellow Kiwi money masters. Cue gasps of horror and 'Told you so!' from crypto fans everywhere, not least because the RBNZ (based, as it happens, in 
            a bland 1960s office block no doubt looking as futuristic when it was first built as the ECB did a decade ago) also used its time before the Finance and Expenditure Committee last Monday to badmouth Bitcoin.
           

              
           

             Sadly for the magic and mystery of central banking today, Orr is far from alone in coming across as a clown, rather than as a frock-coated aristo or a hooded adept tracing pentangles on the floor.
           

              
           

             ""At this stage, the board hasn't ruled out a further increase in interest rates, but neither has it ruled it in,"" says Reserve Bank of Australia chief Michelle Bullock (like her New Zealand counterparts, 
            stuck in a very 'modern' office block), leaving 
            no-one any the wiser.
           

              
           

             ""We don't need inflation to come back to target before we cut interest rates, I must be very clear on that,"" says UK Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey, clarifying nothing instead of trying to address 
            the 3-way split among his policy team on raising, holding or cutting rates at their February meeting.
           

              
           

             As for the USA, ""[interest rate hikes] are not the base case anymore,"" said Fed chair Jerome Powell in mid-December, telling the world that cuts were ""coming into view""...and unveiling 
            Fed forecasts for three Dollar rate cuts in 2024...only to row back frantically ever since after the stock market leapt on his comments and US data continue to come in strong.
           

              
           

             And in Europe? ""79% of Euro area citizens [are] in favour of the single currency,"" said ECB president 
            Christine Lagarde to lawmakers in Brussels last week, ignoring the 70 million people therefore unhappy with the first 25 years of monetary union.
           

              
           

Madame la Gaffe went on to deliver a word salad drizzled with nonsense, topped with croutons of inanity.
           

              
           

             ""We have remained unwavering in our commitment to our primary mandate of price stability,"" Lagarde said with a straight face, claiming that she has been ""responding forcefully to the surge in inflation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis"" even though her team waited 15 months to raise deposit rates from below zero after Eurozone inflation punched up through the ECB's 2.0% target in spring 2021.
           

              
           

             What's more, ""We have taken steps to incorporate climate change considerations into our monetary policy operations,"" Lagarde continued, ""[and] we are making progress in developing a digital Euro, which would strengthen our strategic autonomy and support our competitiveness in a digitalised world.""
           

              
           

             No, this vacuum of meaning isn't the worst thing in the world today. Nor is incompetence sold as 35,000-feet omniscience anything new (""the US house-price drop 
            is contained"" said Ben Bernanke in May 2007; ""if you understand what I'm saying, you aren't listening"" said 
            Alan Greenspan at least 
            twice in the decade before that).
           

              
           

             As for the Led Zeppelin thing, we're just having a bit of fun. The ECB building? It simply ""looks every inch 
            the modern office block"" as the 
            Irish Times said when the Frankfurt tower finally opened... 
           

              
           

             ...a 
            ""new glass palace"" according to 
            Deutsche Welle.
           

              
           

             But that all-knowing tone of Lagarde's. Patient bordering on manic. Imparting wisdom if only you would sit still for long enough.
           

              
           

             Doesn't it remind you of something...?
           

              
           




              
           

             The only photo on Zeppelin's Presence not ripped from a magazine, it shows ""ordinary people"" acting as though this weird (if not occult) behaviour is a perfectly ""ordinary situation"".
           

              
           

             The children certainly don't seem to find it unusual. But clearly, whatever's happening is awful.
           

              
           

             In global money policy, that might echo for savers and investors pushed through the looking glass of 
            negative Euro interest rates from 2014 to 2022. Today, it might resonate for Euro borrowers instead, stuck with the highest interest rates ever in the currency union's 25-year history, even though 
            No.1 economy Germany is mired in recession with overall activity across the 20-nation bloc 
            shrinking for the 9th month running in February.
           

              
           

             But this is the same central bank remember – now trying to find consensus for a single cost of borrowing among 350 million people represented by 20 national central-bank chiefs, albeit perched today high up in their modern glass palace – which 
            raised interest rates going into the 2008 catastrophe phase of the Western financial crisis. After then rushing the other way, and then staying far too low, for far too long, it's now holding rates at record highs to fight an inflation in prices that began to evaporate precisely when it finally edged interest rates above 0% almost 15 months ago.
           

              
           

             Still, every other central bank in the rich Western economies is doing the same. So it's 
            nobody's fault at the ECB, of course."
2024-02-19,"Title:DXY and GSR: 2 Horsemen of Macro Apocalypse
Article:Dollar Index and the Gold/Silver Ratio...

 The TWO HORSEMEN of the Macro Apocalypse are the US Dollar and the Gold/Silver ratio, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 When the global market counterparty – the US Dollar (DXY) – and the Gold/Silver ratio (monetary, counter-cyclical vs. a less monetary, more cyclical/industrial precious metal) rise moderately, then the indication can be Goldilocks/disinflation, like the backdrop we've generally had for a year now.
 But when they rise strongly or impulsively, the indication is to get the hell out of the asset pool, because its liquidity will be drained.
 When they drop together, the indication is for a macro party that can include and eventually favor commodities, inflation trades and a generally wider scope of bullish assets than the Goldilocks Tech/Growth theme. This would include the precious metals, given that the elusive longer-term bullish backdrop (post-bubble contraction) is not yet in play.
 (With silver leading gold, the precious metals would likely rally along with the inflation trades as they so often do. The best fundamental backdrop would come after the big macro bubble pops, which is not yet the case.)
 The US Dollar index is lurking below the pivot point of the December high, which would indicate a shift to an intermediate uptrend and test of the 105.90 area. It already poked above and now flags at a decision point. For their part, RSI looks orderly climbing its EMA 20 and MACD is positive.
 The Gold/Silver ratio, however, is not looking stellar in support of USD. The trend is still biased up, but thus far there's been nothing even approaching impulsive and if this were a stock chart we'd be considering the possibility of a short-term double top. In NFTRH we had noted that the up leg in the Gold/Silver ratio that began on December 1st was a positive divergence to the US Dollar index, which finally followed suit at the end of the month.
 
 If USD and the Gold/Silver ratio continue as they have been, bullish biased but not impulsive, Goldilocks can persist.
 If USD and the Gold/Silver ratio rise impulsively, pain will likely sweep across the market landscape.
 If USD either fails here or continues firm but not impulsive, a decline in the Gold/Silver ratio could diverge and lead to future USD downside (much as it led the upside), allowing cyclical inflation trades and precious metals to enter the party and approach the punch bowl."
2024-02-15,"Title:Gold? Get Diversified!
Article:Inflation isn't backing off as Fed expected...

 DESPITE the Wall Street happy talk about the Federal Reserve winning the battle against inflation, that battle has not been won, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Headline CPI (the kind Americans actually pay, not constructs like ""core"" and ""super-core"") was 3.1% in January, where it was in November and compared with 3.0% last June.
 In other words, inflation is not gone and may even be on the rise with higher oil prices lately due to geopolitical concerns. The Fed will not raise rates, but they will not be quick to cut them given continued inflation.
 Inflation has a way of sneaking up on investors in small increments and can do a lot of damage before investors see it for what it is. Sure, 3.1% inflation is a lot better than 9% inflation.
 But January's 3.4% inflation rate cuts the value of a Dollar in half in 21 years and half again in another 21 years. That's a 75% Dollar devaluation in just 42 years or the course of a typical career from age 23 to age 65.
 That's one of the main reasons I recommend gold. Gold is priced in Dollars. Inflation means the Dollar is worth less in terms of purchasing power. That means it takes more Dollars to buy gold, so the Dollar price of gold goes up.
 What you may lose in the rest of your portfolio in terms of Dollar purchasing power is made up in part or all from the profits you make on the higher Dollar price of gold. Owning gold will protect you from the ravages of inflation. You'll have your inflation protection in place 24/7 and won't be caught off-guard.
 Geopolitical conflicts and political turmoil often result in unforeseen consequences. These consequences can include supply chain disruptions, economic sanctions, asset seizures and freezes, bond defaults, bank failures and inflation. Oil prices can spike if key waterways are closed, or a vessel is sunk.
 Economic sanctions and financial warfare can cause recession or a banking crisis almost overnight. Assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and alternative investments can be adversely affected by such changes without warning.
 Gold tends to be insulated from such shocks because there is no issuer, no creditor and no country involved. It's just gold. That means you can hold it safely and wait out the turmoil without adverse effects.
 Gold prices do not correlate closely to stock prices. Gold and stocks are driven by separate factors. That makes gold a good diversification asset for portfolios that are heavily in stocks. When a portfolio is highly diversified, it can produce higher expected returns without adding risk.
 The difficult part is finding asset classes that really are diversified. Buying 50 different stocks is not diversification since you only have one asset class – stocks – and the behavior of various shares will be highly correlated in times of stress. Gold is genuinely diversified from stocks and will improve portfolio returns.
 Gold prices have been trending higher lately with some volatility along the way. These trends toward higher prices have been driven by lower interest rates; continued inflation; geopolitical concerns about the Middle East; and continued buying by central banks, especially Russia and China.
 All those trends will continue. One of the principal drivers of the gold price rally is the steep decline in interest rates in recent months. The interest rate (expressed as a yield-to-maturity) on the 10-year US Treasury note plunged from around 5.0% to 4.0% in a matter of weeks at the end of 2023.
 Don't mistake a 1.0% move for something small. That's an earthquake in bond markets, especially in such a short period of time (47 days). A 1.0% move in that short a period of time has only happened in the Treasury market six times in the past 30 years.
 Rates have backed up slightly in the past month, but that's to be expected. Nothing moves in a straight line. The decline in rates will resume in the months ahead as the US economy moves into disinflation and recession. That will give a boost to the Dollar price of gold since notes and gold compete for investor allocations. Lower interest rates generally make gold relatively more attractive since gold has no yield.
 Meanwhile, Russia and China and other central banks have been adding to their gold reserves consistently since 2008. Total gold reserves have increased from about 600 metric tonnes to 3,000 tonnes in Russia, and over 2,000 tonnes in China (although there is good reason to believe that China's gold reserves are much higher, perhaps double the official figures or more).
 That increase in gold holdings will continue and probably accelerate as the US threatens to seize Russian reserves in the form of Treasury securities and as progress is made on the new BRICS gold-linked currency.
 Every investor should have an allocation to gold in her portfolio. It's an excellent diversification and can be a powerful asset to have in the face of natural disaster, infrastructure collapse or social unrest.
 I recommend a 10% allocation of investable assets to gold. In calculating investable assets, you should exclude home equity and the value of any private business. Don't gamble with your house and livelihood.
 Whatever is left (stocks, bonds, real estate, alternatives) are your investible assets. Allocate 10% of that amount to gold. That allocation is high enough that you'll make significant profits (and protect against losses in the rest of your portfolio) if gold soars, but small enough that your overall portfolio won't be hurt badly if gold goes down.
 I believe a 10% allocation is the sweet spot for both profits and downside protection. The bottom line is gold is like an anchor for the rest of a diversified portfolio.
 Gold is physical so it is not easily frozen by government fiat. It offers diversification because it does not correlate to other asset performance (except Treasury notes on occasion). It is the best hedge against inflation.
 Gold should not dominate any portfolio, but it should be part of every portfolio."
2024-02-14,"Title:Prepping Gold for the 'Post-Bubble'
Article:Stocks keep soaring, miners keep hurting...

 The BUBBLE in 'no holds barred' monetary policy (birthed under Alan Greenspan) and the bullish markets it benefits are in their third decade, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Gold, meanwhile, will not be ready until the ""post"" bubble.
 This is an article from a source, yours truly, who considers it his job to define the 'top down' macro before trying to pick stocks. In other words, it is important to get the big picture macro, as well as its shorter-term rotations, right before trying to select stocks and the sectors they reside in.
 In an extreme example, the gold mining sector has been most often impaired by the 'bubble on' macro, including its inflationary phases, not helped by it. ""Post-bubble"" will be a different story. But you can't change the macro because of 'want'. It will change when it is good and ready.
 In the year 2001 Sir Alan Greenspan was forced to abandon his stately ""Maestro"" image in favor of a more desperate, even panicky version of himself. That desperation was put into effect by the various inflationary means used to birth and blow the credit bubble, which launched the real estate/mortgage bubble and eventually, the great stock market bull that persists to this day.
 This is ancient history (2003-2008), but it was an important time when we as market participants were taken down the rabbit hole, whether we liked it or not. Fittingly, the end of this historical phase resolved in a righteous market liquidation of Q4 2008.
 By then it was Ben 'the Hero' Bernanke's turn to try his hand at inflationary bubble making, and inflationary bubble-make he sure did. New and unusual methods of QE/Bond Manipulation/ZIRP and a new twist on things in order to ""sanitize"" (the actual word the Fed used back then) inflation signals out of the macro, aptly named Operation Twist.
 You think this was anything remotely resembling normal? This 'twist' not surprisingly came after the Bernanke Fed had cooked up inflationary operations of its own that were threatening to point a finger right at these big brained monetary/economic intellectuals that were primary in creating every inflation problem since 2001.
 Inflation begins with money printing by various means. The pure definition is inflation of money supplies chasing finite assets. Inflation was turned on like a spigot whenever our remote-controlling monetary managers wished. Later, in its effects, come the cost-push inflationary problems like those of the recent cycle.
 The Federal Reserve actually saw the potential for its previous inflationary episodes to get out of hand (Greenspan era into the Bernanke era) and concocted a bond market manipulation scheme to paint inflation right out of the picture. And guess what? The market bought it. Market players bought it. Lapped it up like dogs. They kicked the 10yr-2yr yield curve into a flattening phase and Goldilocks flavored economic boom. That was generally the 2013 to 2019 era generally attended by a strong US Dollar.
 To this day, the dogs devour every morsel thrown their way and their confidence in our monetary regulators is intact, by definition. Every time a still hot economic or inflation signal comes in the market quakes in its boots, and that includes the anti-bubble, gold. Confidence = intact. Gold is for when ""intact"" becomes ""unglued"".
 Hence, the only thing a right-minded market participant can do (excluding the vast majority who still think it's normal as their financial advisers continue to cost average up into nosebleed territory) is not short it in committed fashion, play it from the long side with risk management, or sit and collect the cash income that the Fed is paying you to take advantage of.
 As for speculating from the long side, what has been working best over the last year is what we originally projected a year ago: the Goldilocks stuff.
 A market in full submission to the Fed's every utterance from its various orifices continues to view 'cost-push' inflation implied in the January Payrolls report and even a slight uptick in Manufacturing (we'll take a brief look at the latest ISM in this weekend's NFTRH report) with fear of the Fed, which in turn has been driving the US Dollar.
 So confidence is intact, by definition. Markets are flat out bullish. AI is going to make us all rich (well, I sold SMCI too soon, collecting only a 70% profit on two separate trades. Actually, I had to sell SMCI just as I had to sell ANET before it because my DNA directs me not to be a hype follower and by extension, anything resembling a committed bubble player.)
 This graph produced by John Hussman was taken from a more extensive article, which you may want to check out. Feel free to reference the NFTRH Links page any time, as you'll find Doc Hussman and many other worthwhile sources there (market tools, economic data, industry news/analysis, biased and unbiased analysis alike, and so much more). I've built that links page for my own reference. Why not bookmark it for yourself?
 Here Hussman illustrates in one picture that our bullish markets and strong economy are the products of leverage. In an ongoing bubble this does not matter. In a bursting bubble? Well, it matters.
 
 So the above is a bullish picture at high risk because it is the product of leverage to a growing debt pile and by extension, deficits. That is what the economy and associated bull market are built upon.
 Play it if you will, but also understand it for what it is. For those submitting to the Fed's every utterance (not to mention to their mainstream financial advisers' assurances that they are professionally managing their wealth in the ways of tradition) it's all good...as long as the bubble in policy and associated markets and thus, confidence are intact.
 Other indicators we use in NFTRH show what we have been noting for months; that the market is two things: 1) bullish and 2) at high risk. To save room for more pointed discussion about individual equities and strategy in the upcoming NFTRH 796, I'll drop a cavalcade of our indicators in this public article for subscribers and the public alike to review.
 Again, I want to remind you that the Goldilocks story above is from a year ago when nobody else was talking ""Goldilocks"" and a relative few were talking bullish in general. I point that out because when I write highly negative articles like I perceive this one to be, proven credibility (that I've not been a perma-bear, perma-bug or perma anything else to this point) is important. I simply have to write about what I see and I don't care whose agenda it may or may not serve.
 On that note, risk is play in the form of sentiment and in the form of other indicators like the extreme low in the defensive Healthcare sector to the broad SPX. The XLV/SPY ratio has historically and reliably spiked upward into and during bear markets and hard corrections. The exception was 2012 to 2016, when there was a lot of Healthcare-related political noise in the picture. The ratio shows high risk to equities and yet a still bullish situation.
 Speaking of a still bullish situation, the Semiconductor > Tech > Broad leadership chain has been a staple in NFTRH, keeping us from attempting an active bearish orientation and/or keeping us with a bullish view (risk and all). SOX leading NDX and NDX leading SPX is the bullish leadership recipe. It's intact, if not yet fully baked.
 As for gold, it is not yet signaling either a bear market or an illegitimate bull market for stocks.
 
 During the un-shaded period from 2002 to 2011 the stock market spent the majority of the time in an apparent bull market. Stocks were going up! Gold went up better. Currently, SPX/Gold shows stock bulls sleeping soundly.
 However, the Copper/Gold ratio shows that aside from the 'strong Dollar'/Goldilocks stuff, a down economic cycle and stock market bear are just itching to come into play. Post-election, perhaps? Can they hold it together that long? NFTRH 795 put on its tin foil hat recently and took a hard look at that question, both pro and con.
 
 Meanwhile, another risk indicator to a still bullish market situation is the current state of the VIX vs. the bulling SPX. It's not a major thing, visually. But historically the VIX has tended to travel at least flat with a positive bias prior to SPX corrections. Today? Well, VIX is traveling with a positive bias in defiance of the big bull move in SPX.
 We anticipated, if not predicted a bull move in SPX, after all. The anticipation was for anything from a slight higher high double top to an upside 'suck 'em in' FOMO extravaganza and upside blow off. The market is agitating for the latter now.
 Ironically, the recent bump up in Fed hawkishness could sustain the bull run in stocks longer than if they had remained stapled to the March rate cut view. It's when the Fed is finally compelled to start cutting to get in line with the declining 2yr yield that max bear damage has been inflicted. I don't say so. The chart and history say so.
 There are many more indicators we use. From Libor Yields to High Yield Spreads to Yield Curves and more that are currently telling us the...
 Bottom Line (as per NFTRH for much of the last year):
 The stock market – especially in its headline areas – is bullish and... The stock market is at high risk.
 Gold, not mentioned much in this article, nonetheless lays in wait for the post-bubble. I'll continue to respect the idea that a major post-bubble indicator kicked in in 2022. That would be in the in the form of the king of NFTRH indicators, the 30-year bond yield Continuum, which after years of keeping us aware that inflationary policymakers were in full control (the Continuum indicated pleasant disinflation, after all) smashed its limiting moving averages.
 And you wonder why today's Fed is so zealous about fighting inflation?
 
 ""Post-bubble"" will be the only macro that will sustain an extended and potentially epic move in the gold mining industry. Because by then, the gold mining product's relationship to cyclical and risk 'on' asset markets will leverage the miners' bottom lines to the upside.
 This is the Bob Hoye playbook, but it's been elusive over the bubble years (decades) and it's still not quite time yet."
2024-02-13,"Title:Easy Money, Rotten Economy
Article:How low rates and QE distort wealth and incomes far into the future...


              
           


WE HAVE YET to reach a full reckoning of the consequences of the era of easy money, but it's abundantly clear that it ruined us, 
            writes Charles Hugh Smith on his OfTwoMinds blog in this story reposted by Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             The damage was incremental at first, but the perverse incentives and distortions of easy money – zero interest rate policy (ZIRP), credit available without limits to those who are more equal than others – accelerated the institutionalization of these toxic dynamics throughout the economy and society.
           

              
           

             Fifteen long years later, the damage cannot be undone because the entire status quo is now dependent on the easy-money bubble for its survival. Should the bubbles inflated by easy money pop, the financial system and the economy will collapse into a putrid heap, undone by the perversions and distortions of endless easy money.
           

              
           

             Easy money created destructive, mutually reinforcing distortions on multiple fronts. Let's examine the primary ways easy money led to ruin.
           

              
           

             The near-zero rate credit was distributed asymmetrically; only the wealthiest few had access to the open spigot of ""free money."" The rest of us saw mortgage rates decline, but we were still paying much higher rates of interest than corporations, banks and financiers.
           

              
           

             If we'd all been given the opportunity to borrow a couple million Dollars at 1% and put the easy money into bonds yielding 2.5%, skimming a low-risk 1.5% for producing nothing, we'd have jumped on it. But that opportunity was only available to banks, the super-wealthy, corporations and financiers.
           

              
           

             The chart below show the perverse consequences of offering the wealthiest few limitless money at near-zero rates while the rest of us paid much higher interest.
           

              
           

             The wealthiest few could buy income-producing assets on the cheap at carrying costs no ordinary investor could match. Since there was so much ""free money"" sloshing around for financial elites to tap, the demand for income-producing assets soared, pushing prices into the stratosphere. These enormous increases in valuation generated stupendous capital gains for the wealthiest few.
           

              
           

             Look at 2009 as the starting point in these charts, as that's when the Federal Reserve instituted ZIRP and opened the spigots of easy money to ""those with first access,"" i.e. banks, corporations and financiers.
           

              
           

             Here we see how the assets of the top 0.1% more than tripled since 2009, far outpacing inflation.
           

              
           




              
           

             The net worth of the top 1% went ballistic as well. Nearly free credit is rocket fuel if you're first in line and nobody else gets the same interest rate.
           

              
           

             The bottom 50% of American households lost ground in the era of easy money. This is not coincidence, it's direct causation: Give the lowest interest rates and unlimited credit to the wealthy, and they will buy up the most productive assets, leaving crumbs for the rest of the American citizenry.
           

              
           

             Here's the Fed balance sheet, the money they created out of thin air and injected into the cheap-unlimited-credit-for-the-wealthy machine.
           

              
           




              
           

             Note how the easy money sparked federal borrowing. Federal debt was under the line of GDP expansion until 2009, at which point it took off in a parabolic ascent.
           

              
           

             Now that interest rates have finally normalized a bit, the gargantuan interest on this debt will be extracted from the citizenry via higher taxes and/or reduced federal spending. (Giveaways to wealthy political donors will of course remain untouched, along with tax havens for the super-wealthy.)
           

              
           




              
           

             The social perversions of easy money are equally destructive. When it's cheap and easy to borrow more money, that becomes the ""obvious"" way to deal with challenges. This incentivizes enterprises and institutions to advance those with skills in finance and PR rather than in management.
           

              
           

             With the discipline imposed by the cost of money gone and the expansion of opportunities to reap fortunes by pyramiding credit and leverage, competency was redefined from management focused on increasing productivity and cutting costs through efficiencies to extracting the soaring value of existing assets: Nothing new was produced but yowza, a lot of people sure got rich.
           

              
           

             The rot created by easy money has seeped into every fiber of our social, political and economic orders. Correspondent D.T. drew a direct line between easy money and the decline of competence in The Powers That Be:
           

              
           

             ""Nepo[tism] babies selected by accident of birth without any tempering in flames...cocooned in their own reality, disdainful of the unselected, coddled and hothoused, ignorant of history and, worst of all, supremely confident in the superiority of their own righteous abilities...because when you get first dibs on the free money there are no consequences you can't buy your way out of.""
           

              
           

             Is there any doubt that what some are calling The Disconnected Elite (DE) have fortified their Ivy League-luxe-enclave bubbles and unearned privileges with the easy money that comes with their position atop the heap?
           

              
           

             The cost of this elevation of incompetence, the complete disconnection from the realities of everyday Americans and the hubristic confidence in their own talent – i.e., believing your own PR – has hollowed out the nation's institutions in ways those outside the institution cannot yet observe.
           

              
           

             The rot caused by easy money will only become fully visible when the hollowed-out institutions start collapsing under the weight of incompetence, debt and hubris.
           

              
           

             Though few want to admit it, our system is obsolete. And obsolete systems are much more difficult to replace, for everyone being enriched by these arrangements will move heaven and Earth to keep them firmly in place, lest their share of the gravy train diminish.
           

              
           

             The maximization of self-interest comes at the cost of system stability. Put another way, the system can either be optimized for self-enrichment or for dynamic stability, but it cannot be optimized for both, as self-enrichment is best served by monopoly – the destruction of the dynamic stability created by competition – or by reducing adaptability as a means of locking in private gains.
           

              
           

             And so various policies are ramped up to keep all the machinery in its current configuration. These policies may be for show, accomplishing little, or they may reach extremes, as only extremes can keep the machinery duct-taped together as obsolescence decays the system's functionality.
           

              
           

             We can anticipate the uneven unraveling of systems which no longer respond to extreme policy ""saves."" I expect health care, higher education, commercial real estate and banking and the financial system based on extremes of debt and speculative leverage to all unravel, despite the hasty passage of ever more extreme policies.
           

              
           

             In my view, there is no way the status quo can chug along virtually unchanged for decades to come. There are two basic reasons:
           

 Do the math: The limits of the real world cannot be dissolved by trickery, and...
 The core systems of the status quo are obsolete. They are being defended not because they work but because those being enriched by the systems want to maintain their power and perquisites.


              
           

             Another way of saying this is that the forces that have been tailwinds – hyper-globalization, hyper-financialization and stable global arrangements – have shifted into headwinds.
           

              
           

             What were deemed solutions have become problems, and doing more of what worked in the past only accelerates the unwinding."
2024-02-12,"Title:The Future Is Orange. Copper, In Fact
Article:Base metal pivotal in global growth and sustainability


              
           


COPPER was one of only two metals that finished 2023 in the black, gold being the other metal, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             And with global manufacturing slowly stirring back to life, as evidenced by a positive purchasing managers' index (PMI) reading in January, industrial metals – copper especially – look poised to benefit.
           

              
           

             The asset flashed a bullish ""golden cross"" signal, with the 50-day moving average jumping above the 200-day moving average, and prices currently look stable in the $8,400-8,600 per tonne range.
           

              
           




              
           

             Some industry leaders are anticipating lofty gains in the coming months.
           

              
           

             The billionaire founder of Ivanhoe Mines, Robert Friedland, has forecast a potential surge in copper prices to $9,500 a tonne this year. This bullish call is supported by a combination of lower interest rates later in the year and a ramp-up in demand from China, which Robert stresses has not slowed its consumption of the red metal, despite the country's shaky real estate market.
           

              
           

             China, in fact, bought more copper in 2023 than in any other year on record, importing 27.54 million tonnes.
           

              
           

             ""Everybody knows about the weak real estate market in China...but military demand, national security demand, [and] demand for militarization is very high,"" Robert told Bloomberg TV last month.
           

              
           

             This, I believe, will more than offset the sluggishness in copper demand from Chinese property developers. (And for what it's worth, Reuters reports that the country's property sector is showing signs of recovery, with new home prices rising at the fastest pace in two and a half years and government land sales finally turning positive after 23 months.) China's recent move to pump about 1 trillion Yuan ($140 billion) into its economy acts as a further catalyst, promising to boost copper demand.
           

              
           

             Copper's allure, however, isn't just a product of market speculation. It's rooted in its critical role in powering the green transition. In 2023, renewable energy contributed an unheard-of 11.4 trillion Yuan ($1.6 trillion) to China's economy, more than any other sector, according to a report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clear Air (CREA). The Asian giant invested $890 billion in clean energy technologies last year, similar in size to the GDPs of Switzerland and Turkey.
           

              
           

             While the mining sector often finds itself at the crossroads of environmental debates, copper emerges as a more favorable bet, I believe, than traditional transition technologies like wind and solar. This is particularly notable considering the red metal finished last year with a slight increase of 1.2%, while the S&P Global Clean Energy Index sank over 21%.
           

              
           




              
           

             In addition, the global economy appears to be on surer footing than many anticipated. With the rate of inflation on a downward trajectory, we're likely to see a softening of interest rates by the Federal Reserve by midyear at the latest. This economic environment bodes well for industries reliant on copper, including automotive and consumer goods manufacturing.
           

              
           

             The global manufacturing sector is also showing signs of a pulse. The J.P.Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI hit the neutral 50.0 mark in January, halting a 16-month streak of sub-50 readings. This suggests a stabilization in global manufacturing, a critical user of copper.
           

              
           




              
           

             US manufacturers kicked off the year with renewed optimism and an uptick in demand. The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI climbed to 50.7 in January, its highest level since September 2022. This positive shift was attributed to easing inflation and more accommodating financial conditions, alongside an increase in production and payroll numbers.
           

              
           

             The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI, on the other hand, showed that US factories were still in contraction mode, but only barely. The Manufacturing PMI registered 49.1 in January, up from 47.1 in December and marking the 15th straight month that the reading was below the 50.0 threshold.
           

              
           

             The confluence of economic resilience, burgeoning demand from key sectors and a revitalization in global manufacturing paints a compelling picture for copper in 2024. I'm convinced that the metal is poised not just as a material of historical significance but as a pivotal element in driving forward the next phase of economic and technological progress. In this sense, copper is not merely a commodity; it's a catalyst for a new era of global economic growth."
2024-02-09,"Title:Platinum Never Cheaper vs Gold But Erases Palladium Price Discount
Article:2024 forecasts predict big split for PGMs...


              
           


The PRICE of PLATINUM has erased its discount to sister metal palladium for the first time in 6 years, but it's hit a new record discount against gold after the PGM metals both fell hard on concerns over 2024 supply and demand.
           

              
           

             The 'basket price' of platinum-group metals sank by 38% last year, leaving ""roughly half of global PGM mine supply operating at a loss,"" says specialist consultancy Metals Focus, comparing spot bullion prices with the 'all-in sustaining' measure of mining costs.
           

              
           

             But while 2024 output will fall according to speakers at this week's Mining Indaba conference in No.1 platinum producer South Africa as well as to No.1 palladium miner Nornickel in Russia, the projected cuts failed to stop both metals dropping hard in price this week, because demand may fall more steeply on some estimates. 
           

              
           

             That would reduce the supply deficit in platinum from last year's record and threaten to create a surplus in palladium.
           

              
           




              
           

             Analysts entering this year's LBMA forecast competition on average forecast a 
            palladium price drop of 20.7% across 2024 from last year's annual level of $1337 per Troy ounce – an outcome they overshot by $472 in their consensus forecast for 2023.
           

              
           

             Even the most 'bullish' forecast – given by Peter Fertig of Germany-based QCR Quantitative Commodity Research – predicts an annual average price drop of 6.5%, albeit more than 28% above palladium's 2024 average price to date. 
           

              
           

             Platinum, in contrast, finds its most bearish forecast almost in line with last year's level, with Alexander Zumpfe of German refiners Heraeus predicting $950 per ounce, while the most bullish prediction comes 14.5% above the 2023 annual average as bullion bank HSBC's James Steel predicts $1105 per ounce, $100 higher than the consensus.
           

              
           

             The most bearish palladium forecast, down at $724 per Troy ounce from Ross Norman of price data and news aggregator Metals Daily, would represent the precious metal's cheapest annual average since 2016.
           

              
           

             Forty per cent of current world platinum output goes to meet net demand for autocatalysts – needed to reduce harmful emissions from fossil-fuel engines – with the rest going to jewelry, investment coins and bars as well as 
            industrial platinum uses across the chemicals, petroleum, electrical, glass and medical sectors.
           

              
           

             Palladium in contrast finds over 90% of its demand from autocats, almost exclusively for gasoline-engine systems.
           

              
           

             Platinum traded at a premium to the gold price all through the 20th Century, but fell below the 'safe haven' precious metal in 2015 as the ""diesel scandal"" broke around automakers cheating emissions standards, leading European consumers to switch to buying gasoline cars instead.
           

              
           

             Platinum in 2017 then fell below the palladium price, sinking to a $2000 discount as the dearer PGM spiked to record highs when Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine spurred 
            expectations for a Western import ban.
           

              
           

             Palladium's tighter supplies, price spike and premium to platinum eventually spurred substitution of the cheaper and more versatile metal into gasoline autocats, 
            raising platinum's auto-sector demand and hitting palladium's even as the long-term outlook worsened for all internal-combustion engine systems amid rising sales of electric vehicles.
           

              
           

             Estimates from the World Platinum Investment Council project a market surplus in palladium from 2025, while ongoing substitution, the rise of electric vehicles, and a ""surge in secondary supplies due to higher auto recycling...puts palladium on a path of rising surpluses,"" according to bullion refiners MKS Pamp's Nicky Shiels.
           

              
           

             ""We are already seeing substitution 
            slowing down or in some cases stopping,"" says Nikos Kavalis at Metals Focus.
           

              
           

             ""It won't be an overnight change, as autocatalyst designs can happen a long time before cars actually come off the production line.""
           

              
           

             While erasing its discount to palladium this week, the 
            price of platinum also fell hard in Dollar terms, beating November's 
            previous record platinum-gold discount with a gap of $1150 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             ""Despite a platinum market in deficit,"" says consultant Robin Bhar, giving a near-consensus price forecast for 2024 of $1010 per Troy ounce, ""the downward pressure from the weakening global economy is likely to keep the price in a similar trading range to last year.""
           

              
           

             ""Major producers have already initiated a halt to the expansion of new projects to contain costs and remain competitive in a market in transition,"" says Debajit Saha of LSEG business Refinitiv, coming $5 the other side of the LBMA forecast competition's $1015 consensus prediction.
           

              
           

             Palladium's consensus view, 
            given by Bart Melek of Canadian brokerage T.D.Securities with a forecast of $1056 – just $4 below the competition's average outlook – notes how speculators in CME Nymex futures and options have ""built a behemoth net short position which notably weighed on prices over the last year"" as substitution hit sentiment.
           

              
           

             ""Demand should post a rebound later in 2024,"" Melek says, ""once China’s economy [improves] and Western macro headwinds stop blowing as [interest] rates moderate...[and as] higher loadings [per autocat] associated with stricter air quality rules across the world...also contribute to the move higher."""

Article:See those tractors heading for the Bastille...?


              
           


TO SOME, the most appropriate economic analogue for the current parlous state of the world is the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
            writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.


              
           

             The economist Sean Corrigan, riffing on this theme, offers the coinage of 'the Great Suppression'. Our preferred comparison, as things currently stand, is with the 1970s, with the economic fallout from the oil crisis, the three-day week, and increasingly fractious relations between unions and the government. But perhaps an altogether darker and more substantial comparative reset is that of the French Revolution itself.
           

              
           

             Some historians, perhaps most notably those of a Marxist bent, regard the French Revolution as the most significant event in the history of the modern world. The Revolution replaced a monarchy with a republic, reshaped the social order and the role of the aristocracy and the Church, ushered in a period of extraordinary outbursts of violence, and ultimately led to a dictatorship under Napoleon – who would then export many of its principles, by force, to much of western Europe.
           

              
           

             Like so many revolutions, this one was in large part triggered by finance. When Louis XVI took to the throne in 1774, the French state was nearly bankrupt, primarily due to the country's involvement in the Seven Years' War and then the American Revolutionary War. A financial crisis and a linked constitutional crisis forced the monarchy to call the Estates General – a body that had not been summoned since 1614. The financial crisis came about through defaults in tax payments after bad harvests and systemic weakness throughout a network of local tax officials and provincial treasuries which ultimately failed. The damage was intensified via a crisis in the international money market following the conclusion of the American war; the market simply stopped lending to Paris, cutting off the King's ability to borrow.
           

              
           

             As Louis' authority evaporated, violence ensued. The fate of Joseph Foulon de Doué, the minister of the King's finances, is illustrative. Parisians alleged that when told that the poor throughout France were starving, de Doué responded that they could eat straw. After the storming of the Bastille in July 1789, de Doué attempted to flee Paris, but he was discovered and forced to walk barefoot back into the city. After trying and failing to hang him three times – since the rope could not support the weight of his body – the mob decapitated him, stuffed his mouth with straw, and paraded his head on a pike.
           

              
           

             Few social groups were spared. In the September Massacres of 1792, more than 1200 people were slaughtered over the course of five days or so, including prisoners, priests and nuns. During the so-called 'Reign of Terror', for example, as many as 40,000 accused prisoners may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial.
           

              
           

             The very earliest days of the Revolution offered a promise of hope, and not just to the citizens of Paris or wider France. The English poet William Wordsworth, in a passage from The Prelude originally published as French Revolution as It Appeared to Enthusiasts at Its Commencement, had written
           

              
           

             ""Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
           

             ""But to be young was very heaven!""
           

              
           

             But by 1794, sickened by the wild violence that attended the Revolution, he was saying in a letter to a friend that ""I am of that odious class of men called democrats"", and in another he flatly stated ""I recoil from the bare idea of a revolution."" By 1811, in View From the Top of the Black Comb, he was likening Napoleon to Milton's Satan.
           

              
           

             The author and critic Sinéad Fitzgibbon writes of the Revolution as seen through the poetry of the time:
           

              
           

             ""As is often the case with such things, it can be argued that two competing narratives have grown up around the events in France at the end of the 18th century – there is the myth and there is the reality. The second generation of Romantic poets, including Byron and Shelley, were greatly inspired by the utopian ideals of the early Revolution, without giving sufficient weight to the destruction and horror which followed. It was easy for them to embrace a selective, almost mythical, version of events twenty years after the fact. Not so for Wordsworth; for him, the French Revolution was reality, and a painful reality at that. In renouncing all the beliefs he had once held dear, he was perhaps the most honest of them all.""
           

              
           

             Of all the things that governments provide, maintaining the peace is surely at the core. But it seems today that wherever you look, the glue of social order seems to be slowly – or not so slowly – dissolving. One by-product of the pandemic has been a general erosion of trust in many of our own major institutions. The police, the Church, government, the scientific 'establishment', the judiciary, and the mainstream media; each of them has endured a pretty miserable crisis thus far. And then you look abroad. As the sheriff replies laconically to his deputy in the book (and film) No Country for Old Men,
           

              
           

             ""If it ain't [a mess], it'll do till a mess gets here.""
           

              
           

             Expect to hear much more about the Overton Window – of acceptable social policy – in the weeks and months to come. When we first started discussing it, back in 2019 and very early 2020, concepts like UBI (Universal Basic Income) and MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) were still theoretical. Then central bank printing presses throughout the world worked overtime and millions of workers developed a taste for being paid to sit at home, stuff themselves via services like Deliveroo, and watch Netflix. The Overton Window didn't just widen – it was smashed to pieces. But furloughs do not last forever.
           

              
           

             The financial analyst Doug Noland captured the surreal nature of the securities markets at the height of the confected pandemic even as the real economy burned:
           

              
           

             ""A global pandemic and historic economic downturn. A rapidly escalating US/China cold war. [Little did we know what would happen in Ukraine..] Surging US unemployment and economic depression. A deeply fragmented society with intensifying animosity and conflict. Heightened social instability, with mounting protests (and even a number of ugly riots). Friday Drudge headline: 'A Society On Brink of Complete and Utter Chaos...'
           

              
           

             ""A booming stock market. Rapidly expanding 'money' supply. Exceptionally loose financial conditions, with record debt issuance. Huge inflows into corporate investment-grade and high-yield bond ETFs. Record Treasury and investment-grade corporate bond prices.
           

              
           

             ""It's easy these days to question securities market sanity. Yet it's a fundamental tenet of Credit Bubble analysis that things turn crazy at the end of cycles. In the waning days of history's most spectacular financial Bubble, should we be too surprised by Complete and Utter Craziness?""
           

              
           

             It is easy to reach the conclusion that the legacy of the French Revolution – despite its evident cruelty – was ultimately largely benign. In ending the monarchy, France developed democracy. Civil rights were implemented. The French people were granted freedom of speech and of religious worship, freedom of association, freedom of the press and the ownership of land. But looking at the state of the EU and its chaotic response to Covid-19 hardly inspires confidence about the union's sustainability today.
           

              
           

             The rise of China points to a multipolar rather than unipolar geopolitical world, and the global response to the pandemic points to a violent reaction against globalisation – a retreat, if you will, against prospects for wealth, full stop. Meanwhile the unified central bank response – print money and be damned – reinforces the case for the ownership of commodities (especially gold), unloved (but highly cash-generative) value stocks, and absolutely not the ownership of debt, especially government debt.
           

              
           

             Historians, perhaps inevitably, continue to argue about the importance of what happened in Paris all those years ago. Linda Colley, writing for the London Review of Books in the French Revolution's bicentennial year, 1989, reviews Simon Schama's Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution. Colour him 'not impressed' by its achievements:
           

              
           

             ""Schama's anger is made more emphatic by his belief that the Revolution accomplished very little. Far from making France safe for capitalism, he argues, it actually retarded for several decades the nation's commercial and industrial growth. As for the organisation of the state, he agrees with de Tocqueville that survivals of pre-Revolutionary trends were more apparent than any overwhelming change instituted after 1789. The abolition of seigneurial rights and guilds, he claims, promised ordinary Frenchmen and women far more than they actually gained. And for those who were really poor, the Revolution proved an unmitigated disaster. It devastated the Roman Catholic Church's charitable and educational foundations without in the short term establishing any adequate alternatives. As one of my colleagues at Yale remarked in a recent lecture, Schama's verdict on the French Revolution is doubly damning: its achievements were small and it was horrible.""
           

              
           

             Times of dramatic change are accompanied by huge uncertainty, to be sure – but with great change also comes great opportunity. Fortes fortuna adiuvat. Those who consume their news content via the legacy media may be unaware of the mass farmers' protests that have swept across Europe in recent weeks. Mark Tinker:
           

              
           

             ""As French Farmers shut the auto-routes and effectively blockade Paris, blaming both the French Government and the EU for 'absurd, extreme, and unworkable environmental policies dreamt up by the EU and zealously implemented by the Macron government', the technocrats in Paris and Brussels are getting distinctly nervous.
           

              
           

             ""The quote from Stephane Sejourne (a key ally of President Macron) – 'a populist and nationalist rise almost everywhere in Europe. The risk of ungovernability is quite strong...if the populist parties ever manage to have a blocking minority in the European Parliament' – identifies the real concern, which is not just that the 'peasants are rebelling against the Bien pensants' but that, following the upcoming EU Elections in June, the whole magical thinking that underpins the power of the EU might disappear and it will lose its ability to 'govern' the 448m people in 27 member countries...
           

              
           

             ""It would take a conspiracy theorist to blame either the US or China for deliberately setting policies that suit their own countries at the expense of the EU, but that is almost certainly going to be some of the rhetoric we will start to hear from the populists. Trump has made it clear he will push back against the Democrats' Green agenda on Oil and Gas and will likely spin it as being stopping something that benefits China – who make the electric cars, almost all the solar panels, the key rare earths that go in all the Windfarms, all while using plenty of Coal, gas and Nuclear power.
           

              
           

             ""Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has previously said she would oppose energy sanctions on Russia for example as well as weapons for Ukraine, both seen as US policies.

The Grand Project of the Brussels Bureaucrats is facing attacks from all sides. Death by a thousand cuts even. Ultimately, the Euro itself could come under a lot of pressure.
           

              
           

             ""Thus, rather like the Butterfly's wings over Mount Fuji, we may find that Tractors on the outskirts of Paris could lead to a dramatic unravelling of the stealth Global Government assembled over the last 20 years. Maybe this is the actual Green Revolution."""
2024-02-07,"Title:Gold, Silver and the 'Safe Haven' Dollar
Article:Ratio needs study with USD at key point...


              
           


The U.S. DOLLAR INDEX is at another stubborn decision point, and macro markets hang in the balance as USD and gold's relationship to silver will direct coming market strategies, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the 
            Rabbit Hole.
           

              
           

             With the Fed's FOMC riding into the sunset until March, the US Dollar index is left to fend for itself amid the hawkish (or at least not yet dovish) echos of Jerome Powell's assertion that the market should not expect rate cuts in March.
           

              
           

             Well duh, we know that already, sir.
           

              
           

             The only benefit the US Dollar would be left with, assuming 'not yet dovish' policy does not turn hawkish again, would be the potential for a counter-party bid. An impulsive bid by risk soaked casino patrons suddenly jerking to a safe haven. Which USD surely is, much like gold.
           

              
           

             The difference being that USD is a safe haven tool as long as public confidence in debt paper remains. Gold is a safe 'value' haven, long-term.
           

              
           

             The Dollar, as a tool and with the herd's confidence implied to be intact, by virtue of its global reserve status, receives incoming (forced) 'investment' when herds flee the asset racket, which has been set up counter the US Dollar by decades of US and global inflationary monetary policy.
           

              
           

             Yet here we find a recent disconnect between stocks (S&P 500 and global, ex-US) and inverse USD. Either USD is going to drop (inverse rise back in line with stocks) or just maybe we might have the start of something important in the form of a fundamental change of character in the macro markets.
           

              
           




              
           

             That could mean market rotation, a stock bear market (SPX has finally joined the 'new all time highs!' contingent, after all, a preferred ingredient to making a sentiment fueled top).
           

              
           

             Or, if USD continues to bounce (inverse continues to drop) it could even reach a slippery slope into a market liquidation (again, reference all that 'soft landing', 'no landing' Goldilocks consensus out there in the mainstream financial media for a potential contrary setup).
           

              
           

             The Gold/Silver ratio (GSR) is still perched constructively to attend USD upward, after all. If gold were to rise impulsively vs. silver the inflation trades would be 'off' and the market liquidation trades could be 'on'.
           

              
           




              
           

             Silver is less monetary, more speculative and more cyclical/inflation sensitive than gold. If the GSR breaks down from this constructive perch, the inflation trades would benefit.
           

              
           

             Moving on, let's take a brief look at the technical status of the anti-market, the US Dollar index (DXY).
           

              
           

             Much like the bull trap from September to November felt like it took forever and a day to resolve, today's meeting with resistance is a persistent little bugger. Grinding, chewing and instigating to take out resistance at 103.50. As advised to NFTRH subscribers several weeks ago, the key level to exceed and hold (for USD to go bullish) is the December high at 104.27.
           

              
           

             But first, USD is buzz-sawing the resistance area and the important daily SMA 200.
           

              
           




              
           

             The weekly chart provides the perspective that a level of caution, for inflation traders, is provided by the fact that the index held a higher low to the 'bear trap' low with the bounce starting from clear long-term support.
           

              
           




              
           

             If the US Dollar index fails to make a higher high to the December high and instead turns down (and silver leads gold upward), then the broad rally can continue, especially in the more traditional 'inflation trades' like commodities and equities that produce commodities/resources, and resource rich regions within Emerging Markets.
           

              
           

             If the US Dollar index takes out the December high and holds it, and the Gold/Silver ratio follows its currently constructive pattern upward, you might want to do a thorough check of the investment pool. The might be a turd in there!
           

              
           

             To add a third dynamic, there was a blessed phase from 2001 to 2004 when the Gold/Silver ratio rose (non-impulsively), the US Dollar declined and the gold mining sector had its most fundamentally pure macro backdrop for years previous and now 20 years since.
           

              
           

             After that commodities and stock markets rallied as well and the gold miners entered a bubble amid degrading fundamentals. But even a 2 to 3 year phase would be quite profitable."

Article:How Western investing macro contrasts with China...


              
           


GOLD INVESTING among Western investors and savers just rallied on a dip in the precious metal's price, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault.


              
           

             But profit-taking has continued in 2024 so far, cutting Western gold investment holdings as bullion prices hold close to December's new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Now caring for $3.1 billion (£2.4bn) of securely stored and insured gold bars for over 100,000 users worldwide – almost 90% of them living in North America or Western Europe – BullionVault saw the number of gold buyers rise 19.4% month-on-month in January as the gold price slipped $10 per Troy ounce from 
            December's record-high Dollar gold finish to $2053 (down £12 to £1610 for UK investors).
           

              
           

             The number of sellers meanwhile fell 8.2%. Together that pushed the 
            Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of private-investor decisions in physical bullion, which would read 50.0 if the number of buyers equals the number of sellers – up by 1 point to 52.4, the highest since August.
           

              
           




              
           

             Still, 
            a gold rush this ain't.
           

              
           

             January's bump came after 
            the Gold Investor Index fell to bear-market levels in 2023, even as prices hit record highs.
           

              
           

             Western market retail bar and gold coin demand meantime remains very poor by all accounts, while gold-backed ETF trust funds continue to shrink. And by weight last month, investors using BullionVault were net sellers of gold for the 5th month running, trimming their total holdings by 0.1% to 46.9 tonnes.
           

              
           

             That's the lowest total in almost 3 years. But over that period since April 2021, BullionVault clients' gold holdings have risen 16.8% by value (27.1% in GBP). So it's not like there's a rush for exits from gold, either.
           

              
           

             Bottom line?
           

              
           

             High gold prices plus high interest rates and rising stock markets continue to deter new investment in bullion among Western households and money managers. They also let existing owners bank a profit to rebalance their portfolios.
           

              
           

             These outflows from the gold market also show that, rightly or wrongly, both the financial slump in China and the worsening crisis in the Middle East remain distant issues for Western investors.
           

              
           

             Chinese savers and investors face the opposite situation of low interest rates, a plunging stock market, and a real-estate crash on top. That's spurring record-heavy gold demand by Yuan value in the precious metal's No.1 consumer market. Central banks as a group also continue bidding up gold as geopolitical tensions deepen.
           

              
           

             Back here in Western private investing, new account openings on BullionVault rebounded in January, with the monthly count of new precious-metal investors worldwide rallying 9.5% from December's count.
           

              
           

             But it still came 10.3% below 2023's monthly average to show the weakest 
            January – typically a strong month for first-time bullion investing – since New Year 2007, eve of the global financial crisis.
           

              
           




              
           

             A steep drop in silver prices meanwhile saw the Silver Investor Index jump to an 11-month high in January, rising further from November's record low of 46.4 to read 53.2.
           

              
           

             Silver demand was also positive by weight, rising 1.3% to regain 2/5ths of 2023's net outflow at a total of 1,229 tonnes as the precious metal dropped 2.9% in price to finish January with its lowest monthly close in 3 at $23.09 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             So in silver, as for gold, Western investors have become highly price sensitive, buying the dips but retreating from rising prices. The macro picture meantime works against strategic inflows. Because where's the urgency?
           

              
           

             Looking ahead for gold, the strength in China's domestic gold demand is likely to see global prices ease back as Shanghai prepares to shut for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday on Friday. Historically it would be odd for Western investors to buy that dip; price-sensitive trading is more usually associated with Asian gold markets. But the diverging macro backdrop means they already swapped roles last year.
           

              
           

             2023 marked the first time since 2014 that the size of Western speculative gold investment didn't move in the same direction as the gold price, and it was the first time in at least 20 years that prices rose while Western gold investment shrank. 2023 also saw Chinese households break their previous pattern of gold trading, buying more bullion even as the price rose to new record highs."

""AS GOES January, so goes the year,"" 
            says Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             So runs an ancient Wall Street wheeze.
           

              
           

             How did January 2024 go?
           

              
           

             The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened January at 38,033. It closed January at 38,355.
           

              
           

             If the year goes as January goes...2024 will end in clover.
           

              
           

             Perhaps. Perhaps not.
           

              
           

             Jerome Powell has dashed Wall Street's yearnings for a March ""pivot"".
           

              
           

             The fellow grabbed hold of his telegraph, and messaged Wall Street that a March rate cut was out:
           

              
           

             ""I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March is the time to [cut rates]...That's probably not the most likely case.""
           

              
           

             ""Probably not"" translates to ""certainly not.""
           

              
           

             Poor Wall Street. Poor, poor Wall Street.
           

              
           

             ""There were no surprises in the Fed statement,"" said Wealthspire Advisors' Oliver Pursche, adding that:
           

              
           

             ""It does appear that further rate hikes are off the table, which is a positive, but investors should continue to expect higher for longer as we're still quite a ways away from the sort of economic data that would push the Fed to lower rates.""
           

              
           

             It is the old case of good news and bad news says Art Hogan of B.Riley Wealth:
           

              
           

             ""The good news is we can forget about any more tightening. The bad news it's 'when', not 'if' they're going to cut rates, and that 'when' has been pushed out to what had been the fringes of consensus.""
           

              
           

             Rates will dangle between 3.75% and 4% by year's end, soothsays the market. They presently range between 5.25% and 5.50%.
           

              
           

             The market assumption is that inflation is very nearly licked. It will retreat further yet, and the Federal Reserve can begin axing rates.
           

              
           

             Is it true? We observe that the M2 money supply has expanded $100 billion since October.
           

              
           

             We further observe that supply chains remain, to a fair degree, unlinked.
           

              
           

             These do not suggest deflation or disinflation – but lingering inflation.
           

              
           

             The Federal Reserve claims it will not quit until inflation retreats to its 2% Goldilocks rate. Inflation, officially defined, runs at 3.4%. Thus the Federal Reserve is within hailing distance of its 2% target. Yet it is not within grasping distance.
           

              
           

             And so Wall Street's gleeful ""pivot"" may suffer postponement beyond even March.
           

              
           

             Here is one additional reason we believe in a persistent inflation:
           

              
           

             Experts are nearly unanimous that inflation is scotched. They believe the Federal Reserve will soon have this tiger back in its cage.
           

              
           

             And when experts are in one camp...we instinctively decamp for the opposing camp.
           

              
           

             We distrust crowds – expert crowds in particular.
           

              
           

             It is admittedly a bias, a disposition, a prejudice. We do not claim it is entirely rational.
           

              
           

             And events may prove us mistaken. Perhaps the Federal Reserve will finally seize inflation by the scruff. Yet we cling to our instinct.
           

              
           

             Is our judgment addled by a pessimistic pall? Perhaps. Yet one recent study indicates pessimism is realism. Moreover, that pessimism is intelligence.
           

              
           

             The United Kingdom's University of Bath conducted a study, published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.
           

              
           

             From which:
           

              
           

             ""It is a puzzle why humans tend toward unrealistic optimism, as it can lead to excessively risky behaviour and a failure to take precautionary action. Using data from a large nationally representative UK sample...our claim is that optimism bias is partly a consequence of low cognition – as measured by a broad range of cognitive skills, including memory, verbal fluency, fluid reasoning and numerical reasoning.
           

              
           

             ""We operationalize unrealistic optimism as the difference between a person's financial expectation and the financial realization that follows, measured annually over a decade. All else being equal, those highest on cognitive ability experience a 22% (53.2%) increase in the probability of realism (pessimism) and a 34.8% reduction in optimism compared with those lowest on cognitive ability. This suggests that the negative consequences of an excessively optimistic mindset may, in part, be a side product of the true driver, low cognitive ability.""
           

              
           

             More:
           

              
           

             ""The findings we present provide evidence that forecasting accuracy is linked to cognitive ability. Specifically, we find that higher cognitive ability is associated with a higher incidence of realism and pessimism in beliefs and a lower incidence of unrealistic optimism...
           

              
           

             ""Alongside the large body of literature on unrealistic optimism sits the literature on overconfidence – overestimation or excessive precision in one's estimates of own ability (Moore & Healy, 2008). As with unrealistic optimism, overconfidence has been found to be a pervasive human trait with important affective benefits, such as maintaining self-esteem...""
           

              
           

             Is not overconfidence a distinguishing feature of experts? Hard observation informs us it is.
           

              
           

             Do they not believe in their superior sagacity? Again, hard experience informs us they do.
           

              
           

             Hence our disbelief in them. Hence our disbelief in – or at least suspicion of – the 'inflation is licked' theory.
           

              
           

             This disbelief now finds validation in science.
           

              
           

             Thus we are not pessimistic. We are, in the calculated conclusion of science, realistic. And realistic is superior to optimistic.
           

              
           

             Of course, there is danger here. Validated by science, we may be seduced by belief in our own sagacity. We may swing to the extreme belief that pessimism fully equals realism.
           

              
           

             We must therefore recognize limits. The science, we must concede, may be mistaken. It is even possible that optimism is realism.
           

              
           

             Germany's Iron Chancellor, Herr Bismarck, once argued that ""God looks after fools, drunks and the United States of America.""
           

              
           

             Is their continued prosperity not the triumph of optimism over pessimism?
           

              
           

             We must concede that it is. A pessimist would wager against all of them. Yet their continued prosperity cannot be denied.
           

              
           

             We cannot speak to God's future invigilation of fools and drunkards. Yet He gives strong indication He is turning his gaze from the United States of America."
2024-02-04,"Title:Correlation Breakdown x 3 in Gold
Article:2024 gold price rising, demand to invest falls...


              
           


WEIRD THINGS keep happening to the gold price, 
            says Adrian Ash at BullionVault, breaking its correlation with other assets and – most starkly – snapping its relationship with gold's own market supply-and-demand fundamentals.
           

              
           

             Most starkly, that's broken the inverse behaviour of consumers in China versus investing buyers in the West.
           

              
           

             Take New Year, for instance. January typically brings a bump in Western investment inflows to gold. That pattern has tended to correlate with 
            strong monthly gold-price gains. The strongest on the annual calendar, in fact.
           

              
           

             But although the gold price rose last New Year, it slipped $10 per Troy ounce in January 2024. Demand to invest in gold fell both times.
           

              
           




              
           

             Over the 20 years to 2023, gold prices rose in 14 Januarys. While that was matched by November's winning strike rate, January's average gains beat that month hands down, rising 2.9% against 1.6%.
           

              
           

             Right alongside, January typically saw a big pop in gold investment demand too (marked in red on our chart above) and no matter whether the pattern of flows either side was rising or falling.
           

              
           

             Over the last decade, for instance, January brought more first-time users to BullionVault than the rest of the year's monthly average 7 times. Gold-backed ETF investment trusts showed a strong calendar correlation too. January saw net inflows to gold ETFs 8 times in the 10 years to 2023. That was well ahead of that market's average 56% month-on-month strike rate.
           

              
           

             Why invest in gold at the start of the year?
           

              
           

             Maybe the clear (but for now historic) correlation between January and a rise in gold prices became a reason to buy. Maybe bullion demand rose as investors reviewed their portfolio risk, saw potential for trouble in the year ahead, and chose to add a little insurance.
           

              
           

             Either way, 2024 proved different. So did New Year 2023. 
            Gold ETFs shrank last January, and last month those trust funds as a group saw their sharpest New Year outflows since 2014, back when the precious metal was stuck in a deep bear market. BullionVault meantime just saw the weakest January for first-time gold investment since 2007, eve of the global financial crisis. 
           

              
           

             Yes, gold prices fell this January in US Dollar terms, Indian Rupee and British Pounds. But it rose in terms of Euros, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen. More than that,
           

              
           

 gold in Jan 2024 dropped less than US$10 from end-December's record-high finish of $2062 per Troy ounce;
 gold actually rose last New Year when investment demand also shrank; and
 most starkly, the broader correlation between gold's price and demand to invest has broken down anyway.


              
           

             Or rather, the gold correlation between price and investment flows has broken down on the available data.
           

              
           




              
           

             Time was, bullion-market analysts, traders and dealers could rely on the link between Western gold investing flows and the Dollar gold price like the sun coming up in the morning.
           

              
           

             Add together the size of gold ETF holdings (95% of which back trusts listed on US, Canadian, UK, Eurozone or Australian stock exchanges), plus hedge-fund and other speculators' bullish betting on Comex futures and options, and – over the 15 years to New Year 2023 – the correlation was relentlessly positive and almost always strong. On a statistical analysis, the movement of gold prices against gold investment flows across each rolling 12-month period gave an r-coefficient – on average – of 0.887.
           

              
           

             That number would read +1.0 if the price of gold always moved exactly in lockstep with its speculative demand; it would read minus 1.0 if they moved precisely opposite. And while no two things show a perfect correlation, the connection between gold prices and the size of gold ETFs plus the Comex net long position is the strongest relationship gold shows, stronger even that 
            gold's famous correlation with the silver price.
           

              
           

             Or at least, it was. Because over the last 12 months, the correlation of gold's price in US Dollars against the size of ETF plus Comex speculative net betting has sunk, falling to its lowest since at least 2006 down at 0.273.
           

              
           

             Yes, that's still positive, but it's no longer strong. Indeed, if we take that number and multiply it by itself to get what's called ""r-squared"" in statistics – also known as ""the coefficient of determination"" – then we see that the strength of the relationship has sunk by 9/10ths. It's dropped from a median reading of 78.1% between New Year 2008 and New Year 2023, down to just 7.5% over the last 12 months.
           

              
           

             Put another way, 2023 marked the first year since 2014 that the size of Western speculative gold investment didn't move in the same direction as the gold price. It was the first time on record (back to 2006 on BullionVault's analysis) that prices rose while investment shrank.
           

              
           

             What changed? Interest rates. Gold pays no income, but cash in the bank – having paid zero in nominal terms since the global financial crisis began – now offers Western savers a positive real return over and above inflation (or very nearly) for the first time in more than 15 years ago.
           

              
           

             Time was, today's 
            high interest rates would have crushed gold prices (another key gold correlation taking a big hit). But instead, gold prices are trading at or have just retreated a little from record highs, and that's hitting Western investment demand still further, encouraging existing owners to take profits while also deterring new buyers – who can, after all, put their cash into bonds or the bank to get a positive real return 'risk free' instead. Or they can pile yet more money into the go-go stock market.
           

              
           

             The Nasdaq 100 returned 53.8% last year. Facebook just started paying a dividend. 
            Who needs gold?


              
           

             Of course, 
            correlation isn't causation as any intro to statistics course will tell you. The fact that two things move together doesn't mean one is driving the other. But for the price of gold, it makes sense that investment flows have tended to move together with prices.
           

              
           

             Investors in any asset class tend to chase the price higher, and they tend to sell when it's falling. That's how bull and bear markets take hold, becoming longer-term trends in financial trading. Consumers, on the other hand, tend to cut their demand for a good or service when it rises in price – especially if the price jumps – and that is how gold jewellery sales have typically worked among the precious metal's biggest consumer markets of India and China.
           

              
           

             India's households stuck to type last year, according to data gathered for and published by the mining industry's World Gold Council. Counting jewellery, gold coins and small bars, they cut their bullion demand 3.4% by weight as Rupee prices rose 15.5% inside the metal's No.2 consumer market.
           

              
           

             But demand in gold's No.1 consumer nation China actually rose 16.3% last year while Shanghai's benchmark bullion price rose 17.2%, hitting a run of new all-time highs. That marks our third and perhaps most significant break of gold's typical price correlations.
           

              
           




              
           

             2023 was the first year since 2017 that 
            Chinese households, faced with a rising gold price, bought more of the precious metal than the year before.
           

              
           

             You can spot this above, our third and final chart of key gold price correlations which have broken down.
           

              
           

             Over the 10 years to 2022, the weight of China's jewellery, coin and small-bar purchases pretty much mirrored the direction of gold prices. This meant that its consumers, instead of buying gold at rising prices like they had over the prior 10 years, were now behaving like their next-door neighbours in India. Only more so.
           

              
           

             Formerly gold's No.1 private buyer, India has been famous as 
            the ""sink of the world"" for precious metals for 2,000 years and more. But its households haven't acquired perhaps 1-in-every-8 ounces of gold ever mined in history by chasing the price higher. On the contrary, they famously tend to sell or fade the spikes and buy the dips. Which is smart.
           

              
           

             Across the last decade, in fact, Indian consumers' quarterly gold demand went in the opposite direction to Rupee gold prices year-over-year 63% of the time. But the negative correlation was even stronger for China's household gold demand versus prices, with that figure coming in at 73%.
           

              
           

             Simply put, China's consumers were even more price sensitive than India's famously gold-savvy households. Up until early 2023. Then something changed, and so far it has stayed changed too. Boom times are back for China's private-sector gold demand, echoing the big jumps seen when the Beijing dictatorship began to deregulate the domestic gold market in the early 2000s, even though Chinese gold prices keep running to new all-time record highs.
           

              
           

             BullionVault first 
            highlighted this switch last spring. Come the summer of 2023, it 
            got so hot that the People's Bank... 
           

              
           

             ...which still controls the flow of bullion into China (and which, 
            like India, blocks gold bullion's exit entirely)...
           

              
           

             ...put a limit on new imports by capping the number of import licenses it issued to Chinese banks. Maybe it was spooked by the outflow of Dollars needed to pay for gold imports. Maybe it was spooked by the upturn in private gold buying itself. Either way, the net effect was to 
            drive domestic Chinese gold prices higher still...
           

              
           

             ...boosting the incentive for importers to all-time record highs, along with 
            new record highs in the Yuan price of gold as the shortage of supply failed to dent the strength of demand.
           

              
           

             What changed? While Western investors have turned away from gold because of high interest rates and rising stock markets, Chinese households face the opposite situation, plus a real estate crash. Blocked from accessing the currency markets or foreign assets, they're left with gold as the standout choice, and surging demand in gold's No.1 consumer nation shows no sign of letting up.
           

              
           

             One week ahead of Chinese New Year – the biggest gold-buying festival in gold's biggest consumer market – Shanghai gold prices have been running $50 per ounce above quotes in London, the precious metal's key trading and storage hub. Known as the Shanghai premium, this gap represents the gross cash margin for bullion dealers to buy gold in London and air-freight for sale in China. And up at $50 per ounce, that incentive is running more than 10 times the last 10 years' average this close to Lunar New Year, suggesting very strong demand.
           

              
           

             What next? Such strength in China's bid for gold is likely to see global prices fall when Shanghai shuts for the week-long Spring Festival holidays on the evening of Thursday, 8 February. Historically it would be odd for Western investors to buy that dip; price-sensitive trading is more usually associated with Asian gold markets. But they already swapped roles last year.
           

              
           

             To repeat: 2023 marked the first time since 2014 that the size of Western speculative gold investment (ETPs + Comex managed money net long) didn't move in the same direction as the gold price, and it was the first time on record (back to 2006 on our analysis) that prices rose while investment shrank. 2023 also saw Chinese households buy more gold than the year before even as prices jumped to new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Record high gold prices, Western investor outflows, rising demand from China's consumers. This isn't how the global gold market is supposed to work. But the expert consensus says it's probably how gold is going to hold and reach yet more record highs in 2024, as the bid from China – the precious metal's No.1 mining, importing and consumer market – runs higher amid its worsening real-estate and stock-market slump.
           

              
           

             That's even before you look at China's central-bank or investment-sector gold demand. More to come soon on both those factors."
2024-02-01,"Title:Trump Says 'No' to Fed CBDC
Article:Fed Coin not gonna happen under The Donald...


              
           


At a RECENT New Hampshire campaign rally, Donald Trump reiterated what he's been saying for months, 
            writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are dangerous and he would never allow one if elected.
           

              
           

             ""Tonight, I am also making another promise to protect Americans from government tyranny. As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency...
           

              
           

             ""Such a currency would give...our federal government, the absolute control over your money. They could take your money. You wouldn't even know it was gone. This would be a dangerous threat to freedom.""
           

              
           

             Welcome aboard, Mr.President.
           

              
           

             If you've been following my writings, you know that I've been sounding the alarm about what I call Biden Bucks for nearly two years. I've warned about Joe Biden's plan to control your money and take away your privacy rights completely.
           

              
           

             I like to think that someone brought my warnings to Donald Trump's attention since I've been one of very few people to outline the dangers that Biden Bucks pose to Americans' freedom. I'd be very happy if I was at least partially responsible for stopping them.
           

              
           

             To catch you up, Joe Biden is planning to replace your physical cash with new electronic currencies.
           

              
           

             These new electronic currencies are called CBDCs – or, again, ""central bank digital currencies"" (I like to call them ""Biden Bucks"" because I want Biden to take full credit for what I consider to be crimes against American citizens).
           

              
           

             And these Biden Bucks would have the full backing of the US Federal Reserve. They'd replace the cash (""fiat"") Dollar we have now. And if Biden gets his way, they'd be the sole, mandatory currency of the United States.
           

              
           

             What does this mean for you? It would make your money less truly your own. It would be subject to government control, as Donald Trump said in New Hampshire.
           

              
           

             We're already seeing how many retailers are no longer accepting cash across America. What happens when physical cash is eliminated altogether from any payment transactions?
           

              
           

             Imagine this. To further advance his Green New Scam, what if Joe Biden and his cronies decide that gasoline needs to be rationed?
           

              
           

             Your Biden Bucks could be rendered useless at the gas pump once you've purchased a certain amount of gasoline in a week! You want gas, but all you get is a one-word message: Declined.
           

              
           

             How's that for control?
           

              
           

             Biden Bucks would create new ways for the government to control how much you can buy of an item, or even restrict purchases. It would keep score of every financial decision you make.
           

              
           

             In a world of Biden Bucks, the government will even know your physical whereabouts at the point of purchase.
           

              
           

             It's a short step from there to putting you under FBI investigation if you vote for the wrong candidate or give donations to the wrong political party. If any of this sounds extreme, fantastical or otherwise far-fetched, it's not.
           

              
           

             Recently, the FBI and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) sent letters to US banks asking them to identify and provide a list to the government of customers using Zelle, Venmo and similar payment channels who mentioned ""MAGA"" or ""Trump"" in their message traffic.
           

              
           

             They also asked for details on bookstore purchases of ""religious"" articles including Bibles. Finally, they asked for details on those shopping at Cabela's, Dick's Sporting Goods or Bass Pro Shops, presumably on the view that those are places to buy guns and ammo.
           

              
           

             This is a clear-cut violation of the First Amendment (free speech, freedom of religion), Second Amendment (right to bear arms) and Fourth Amendment (no unreasonable search and seizure).
           

              
           

             It's not a crime to write ""MAGA"" etc and therefore there's no reasonable basis for suspecting a crime, and therefore no right to get the information without a warrant, which requires a judge. Any judge would likely reject the warrant request since there's no probable cause.
           

              
           

             This is an obvious case of profiling that may well involve AI. If you shoot someone and you're wearing a MAGA hat, you get arrested for the shooting, not the hat. In this case, the hat is enough to put you under surveillance because you have been profiled as ""an enemy of the people"" by the government's definition.
           

              
           

             I predicted this kind of surveillance would arise with the use of Biden Bucks since the government would have your financial records and would not have to go to the banks or get a warrant. I'd like to say I was wrong, but unfortunately I was right.
           

              
           

             It looks like the FBI is not waiting for CBDCs. They're collecting the same information we said they would directly from the banks. I specifically warned that ""books"" would be one category the FBI would want to know about since it helps with the profiling.
           

              
           

             This goes hand in hand with prior revelations that the FBI was targeting traditional Catholics (especially those who go to Latin Masses) for surveillance as possible terrorists.
           

              
           

             This is exactly why I sounded the alarm back in 2022. This administration is committed to not only taking control of your money with Biden Bucks, but also using the FBI and other government agencies to strip away your rights as citizens.
           

              
           

             That shouldn't surprise you if you've noticed how the administration has weaponized these agencies to punish their political opponents.
           

              
           

             FBI whistleblowers are also stepping forward to reveal that the FBI is lowering standards to recruit more candidates with ""left of center"" political views. They say the agency is attracting candidates who seek to be ""agents of social change versus protecting the country.""
           

              
           

             One whistleblower said he (or she) rejected a special-agent applicant because the candidate's only work experience was ""working two years as a coffee-shop barista and having a bachelor's degree in art history.""
           

              
           

             That's not exactly your stereotypical FBI agent, to say the least. But headquarters ordered the subsequent whistleblower to forward the application. It's not hard to imagine the abuses this type of FBI could commit under a system of Biden Bucks.
           

              
           

             How far will this go? Some Republicans are beginning to act.
           

              
           

             Senator Tim Scott is now demanding explanations from the Treasury Department (which runs the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN), which asked banks for information on customers' religious purchases, including Bibles, as evidence of domestic terrorism. The FBI was working side-by-side with FinCEN on this.
           

              
           

             President Trump is right. Biden Bucks are a dangerous threat to freedom. They're a threat to our constitutional liberties and give the government total control of our private financial information.
           

              
           

             A change in leadership is our last hope in stopping this madness from continuing. With so many of our freedoms at stake, every presidential candidate (outside of Biden, for obvious reasons) should be forced to take a stand on this critical issue."
2024-02-01,"Title:PBoC Now Driving Gold Prices?
Article:Like, this is news...


              
           


A NEW REPORT by BMO Capital Markets suggests that the price of gold is no longer being driven by real interest rates, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             What replaced them? I unveil the answer below.
           

              
           

             First, the American consumer did it again. Thanks in large part to a strong holiday shopping season, US gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a faster-than-anticipated 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The results make the strongest case yet that the Federal Reserve has pulled off a soft landing, but they also raise questions about the timing of the central bank's next move...and where investors should allocate their capital.
           

              
           

             It certainly feels as if the economy has turned a new leaf, and the data appears to bear that out. At the end of last year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish pivot ignited hopes that the days of sky-high interest rates were numbered. 
           

              
           

             his was bolstered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, which shows that Americans' inflation expectations have dropped to a two-year low. And the University of Michigan found that consumer sentiment jumped this month to its highest level since July 2021.
           

              
           

             In December and January, the good vibes saw a cumulative 29% increase, representing the biggest two-month gain since 1991.
           

              
           




              
           

             Businesses are riding the wave of positivity as well. The preliminary Composite PMI for January indicates the sharpest rate of US output growth in seven months, reflecting a buoyant business environment.
           

              
           

             Manufacturers, in particular, are increasingly confident about future output, a sentiment not seen since May 2022. Amid these developments, the betting market is adjusting its expectations for a rate cut. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there's now an 88% likelihood that the central bank will lower rates to between 4.75% and 5.25% in May of this year, not March, as earlier forecast.
           

              
           

             Interestingly, despite the rosier economic outlook, several firms are recommending gold. This may seem counterintuitive, especially with rates still above 5% and the stock market at an all-time high.
           

              
           

             Analysts at J.P.Morgan say the metal will benefit this year from rate cuts and the return of investment demand. XIB Asset Management, the Canadian hedge fund that soared over 200% in the first two years of the pandemic, is now betting that gold and uranium will outperform on lower rates.
           

              
           

             ""Gold and other commodity-driven equities have traditionally performed well during the next stages of the credit cycle,"" one of XIB's founders, Sean McNulty, said in an email to clients, as reported by Bloomberg.
           

              
           

             UBS recommends buying gold on dips below $2000 per ounce. The Swiss institution projects the yellow metal to rise as high as $2250 per ounce by year-end on looser monetary policy, which would put pressure on the US Dollar and real rates, thereby boosting demand, particularly from gold-backed ETFs.
           

              
           

             After three straight years of ETF outflows, UBS predicts a shift to inflows, potentially sparking a sustained rise in gold prices. But as I mentioned at the top, BMO challenges this traditional view, suggesting that the relationship between gold and real interest rates has weakened.
           

              
           

             In a report titled ""New Drivers for a New Gold Era"", BMO commodities analyst Colin Hamilton writes that the gold-real rate correlation, which I've written about many times, is now ""broken."" According to him, this correlation fell apart amid the sharp real rate moves of 2022 and has not been re-established.
           

              
           

             But if rates no longer matter, what's the investment case? Hamilton argues that emerging economies' push to diversify away from the US Dollar by increasing their gold holdings is now the most important driver of the metal going forward.
           

              
           




              
           

             China is particularly key. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has become the world's undisputed gold purchasing leader, buying the metal uninterrupted since November 2022.
           

              
           

             Last year, the bank announced a 225-tonne increase to its gold reserves, which reached 2,235 tonnes by the end of December. The yellow metal now accounts for 4.3% of China's official foreign exchange reserves, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).
           

              
           

             As Bloomberg's Mike McGlone recently put it, ""A top reason [gold] has remained resilient is the deepest pockets on the planet – central banks – are accumulating at a breakneck pace.""
           

              
           

             In addition, 2023 was an especially tough year for many Chinese investors, with stocks declining for the third straight year. The government is reportedly weighing a stock market rescue package backed by two trillion Yuan, or roughly $278 billion, but it's worth pointing out that similar purchases in 2015 did not immediately lift stocks.
           

              
           

             Surveys show that Chinese households are not confident in the economy and are looking to save more and invest less in the stock market. According to Hamilton, the proportion of Chinese households holding higher levels of cash has correlated strongly to Yuan-priced gold, which hit fresh highs in 2023 as the CSI 300 index of Chinese stocks sunk to a five-year low.
           

              
           

             Given these dynamics, the major downside risk to gold prices this year could stem from a risk-on environment in China, such as an equity market rally. However, BMO and Hamilton both expect central bank buying and household investment to be a multi-year theme.
           

              
           




              
           

             In this context, gold emerges not just as a safe haven in uncertain times, but as a strategic asset in a diversifying global economy."

             WE'RE encountering some strange signs of froth in a few not-so-dark corners of the market in the aftermath of the late 2023 melt-up rally, 
            writes Greg Guenther for Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             Sure, the averages have soared off their lows and are teetering on new highs. But most stocks are beginning to churn as the spell of December's disbelief rally begins to fade. Now, we're entering a seasonally weak stretch for the stock market as Q1 of an election year historically brings choppy, sideways conditions. And, as Goldman Sachs notes, February has been the second weakest month for the Nasdaq over the past 40 years.
           

              
           

             Could these data points align with what we're seeing in recent market action as we wrap up January trade?
           

              
           

             As the unflappable mega-caps continue to prop up the major averages, let's check in on the other stocks that aren't shooting higher every day:
           

              
           

             Small-caps are lagging after breaking out as potential new market leaders in Q4. The Russell 2000 is down more than 1% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq 100 has gained more than 4.5%.
           

             Growth names are taking a beating. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) has fallen from grace, breaking from its Magnificent Seven brethren after reporting disappointing earnings. It's down 25% just this month. Meanwhile, tech-growth bellwether ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is also underperforming by a wide margin, down almost 9% year-to-date.
           

              
           

             The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is starting to sputter after trading at nosebleed levels just last week. The sector is finally losing steam following an ugly earnings tumble from Intel Corp. (INTC). Even the most optimistic tech junkie would admit that these impressive stocks could use a break here.
           

              
           

             While stocks aren't triggering any terrifying ""sell everything"" moments, it's not difficult to envision the averages hitting a rough patch – especially as some familiar faces from the Pandemic Bubble reappear on the airwaves.
           

              
           

             My trusty market hype-o-meter is flashing a red alert as growth-stock pushers return to pump their favorite holdings.
           

              
           

             Just last week, Morgan Stanley's Sherry Paul put on a PR clinic during a CNBC appearance where she attempted to describe growth investing criteria by referencing the ""price-to-innovation"" ratio.
           

              
           

             No such metric exists, of course – a fact that Paul clarified as she continued to spout her investing wisdom. Still, all this innovation speak gives me 2020 flashbacks. After all, these buzz-metrics were pioneered by the famous Cathie Wood. It's all part of the playbook! Just rattle off some outrageous price targets and you create a powerful FOMO factory to help your funds vacuum up more Main Street money.
           

              
           

             As you might expect, Paul's ""price-to-innovation"" brouhaha elicited plenty of groans on social media. But I'm more interested in the timing. Remember, growth stocks are struggling this year. Many of these names attempted to break out of big bases during the fourth quarter melt-up rally. Yet many of these moves didn't stick.
           

              
           

             Could these false breakouts lead to more chop and/or downside action in the weeks and months ahead?
           

              
           

             It's possible – despite whatever ""price-to-innovation"" metrics they're concocting out there.
           

              
           

             Not to be outdone, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is back in action as ""Davey Day Trader"" on social media after scooping up shares of Spirit Airlines (SAVE) just before the stock took a 25% nosedive on news that the JetBlue merger plans were starting to crack.
           

              
           

             You might recall the rise of Davey Day Trader and his green hammer during the peak of the pandemic lockdowns. Portnoy was in the trenches every morning, going live on social media to sling message board stocks and tout his favorite holdings, always with the disclaimer that he's a gambler – not an investor or advisor.
           

              
           

             Well, Portnoy is diving back into the markets headfirst with the same swagger, rebooting his Davey Day Trader sessions to stick it to the ""suits"" and the ""shorts"" as he chases one hot stock after another.
           

              
           

             Portnoy is incredibly entertaining – and probably much more calculated and strategic than he admits on his live shows. The fact that he perceives there's a large audience hungry for meme stock content hints that we're seeing some wide-eyed speculators return to the markets following a bear market hiatus. AMC and GameStop might be dead and buried, but it's clear the speculative money is starting to churn now that the 2022 bear market is fading into the past.
           

              
           

             Again, timing is the issue here. If there's one thing we know about the crowd, it's that everyone always seems to get excited at the wrong moment. These same speculators were throwing in the towel and selling every stock in sight in late October. Now, they're loading up on meme stocks and growth names following a historic melt-up rally. It's the perfect time for the market to humble the herd.
           

              
           

             It's starting to get weird out there. We need to keep our thinking caps strapped on tight!
           

              
           

             Stocks continue to chop along this week as we cruise into the heart of earnings season. Household names litter the list of companies reporting, with a significant chunk of the surging mega-caps announcing numbers ahead of the weekend. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are just a few of the big boys attempting to wow investors.
           

              
           

             Then, there's the Fed meeting minutes hitting the tape Wednesday afternoon. Plenty to distract investors heading into what could be a pivotal week as the calendar flips to February.
           

              
           

             Don't get fooled by the hype."
2024-01-30,"Title:Milei Goes to Davos
Article:Blame the rich, embrace capitalism...


              
           


HITLER had 'Mein Kampf', Chairman Mao had his 'Little Red Book', the United Nations have given us Agenda 2030 and their 17 Sustainable Development Goals, 
            writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.


              
           

             Amid the latter, that word 'sustainable' – though undefined – is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting.
           

              
           

             The UN promises to promote sustainable agriculture; it plans sustainable management of water; it plans to ensure sustainable energy; it intends to promote sustainable economic growth; it promises sustainable industrialization; it pledges to make cities sustainable; it intends to promote sustainable consumption.
           

              
           

             By Sustainable Development Goal 14 it has resorted to lazy reiteration, pledging to ""Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development"".
           

              
           

             If recent trends in European government policy in relation to farming, for example, are any guide, then ""sustainable agriculture"" really translates as ""no agriculture"". Cue farmers taking to the roads and motorways of Europe to protest against the continued immiseration of their industry, all in the name of a specious commitment to protecting the world from the (likely non-existent) threat of anthropogenic climate change. Mao is believed to have killed anything from 40 to 80 million countrymen by means of starvation, persecution and mass execution. What will the final toll from UN policy be?
           

              
           

             And then, just for a moment, reality peeped through the veil. For a few minutes at Davos 2024, Argentina's President Milei spoke truth to (delusions of) power. Kate Andrews for 'The Spectator':
           

              
           

             ""...Credit goes to the WEF this year for inviting the antidote to the conference's misguided ideals – and giving him a platform on the centre stage. Argentina's newly elected President Javier Milei's 23-minute speech swiftly and eloquently dismantled the underlying assumption of the Davos conference: that the state and its friends tend to know best. In a total break with the usual platitudes spouted at Davos, Milei opted instead for an unabashed defence of free market capitalism – the only system, he said, which is really 'morally desirable' because of its proved outcomes for people.
           

              
           

             ""The president embraced his previous profession as an economist, starting his speech with a history of global growth and prosperity. What we see is an 'explosion' of growth once capitalism is adopted, he told the audience, which takes the 'shape of a hockey stick' (i.e. an exponential rise). 'Thanks to free enterprise capitalism, the world is now living its best moment' he said. 'Today's world is more free, more rich, more peaceful, and more prosperous than in any other time of human history.'
           

              
           

             ""But Milei has no interest in living in the past: indeed he insisted that his country must provide a contemporary example of what can happen when socialism is implemented. The president is currently working to stabilise the Argentinian economy and prepare the way for classically liberal reforms as he tries to get a grip on the country's inflation rate, which currently sits at over 200 per cent. Argentina should become the warning, he said, for what happens when western countries that 'got rich' off of a 'model of freedom' trade that freedom for the 'road to servitude'.
           

              
           

             ""'The main leaders of the western world have abandoned the model of freedom for different versions of what we call collectivism,' said Milei. 'We're here to tell you that collectivist experiments are never the solution to the problems that afflict the citizens of the world – rather they are the root cause.' These shouldn't be considered extraordinary remarks to hear at an economics conference. Sadly, they are. But his robust attack on socialism was not only a warning to fellow politicians. It was also a warning to business leaders – a call to arms for entrepreneurial 'heroes' to break with the cronyism of political friendships and contracts and to risk the competition of free markets.
           

              
           

             ""Do not live in fear of the 'parasites who live off the state', he insisted. To the disappointment of his critics who keep trying to label the new president as 'far right', Milei was not talking about those who might take benefits or rely on safety nets. Rather, he was talking about the bureaucratic class for whom a big state is necessary to preserve their way of life: a 'political class that wants to 'stay in power and retain its privileges'. It will have made for uneasy listening at a conference like Davos, which is founded on the idea of bringing the state and business into closer partnership.""
           

              
           

             It is difficult not to conclude that the troubles of today's world are largely caused by distant, unaccountable globalist lobby groups populated by psychopaths. Sprinkle in some high profile psychopaths from the corporate sector and the threat to the rest of humanity is all too palpable.
           

              
           

             How did the rot become so entrenched? As we argue in the book 'Investing Through the Looking Glass', just about everybody played a part, but we would single out bank executives, politicians and central bankers for especial credit in the debacle. Bank executives horribly mismanaged their businesses, but rather than have those businesses painfully restructured and lose their jobs in the process, they pleaded innocence and got politicians and central bankers to bail them out instead. Central bankers then ran with the ball in a game that politicians professed to ignore (namely fiscal stimulus, as opposed to wild monetary experimentation), and brought interest rates to where they sit today. The free market essentially got mugged, twice.
           

              
           

             Interest rates matter, and it matters that they are set by a free market, and not by clueless technocrats. As James Grant recently put it in his 'Interest Rate Observer':
           

              
           

             ""...interest rates are the traffic signals of a market economy. Turn them all green, as the central bankers did for years on end, and fender benders will eventually clog the intersections.
           

              
           

             ""Interest rates are prices, and prices convey information, but the thoughtful investor will be careful to weigh the calibre of information thus conveyed. Beware the data that embody the intentions of policymakers rather than the objective facts of the marketplace.
           

              
           

             ""The rate of rise in interest rates this year (2022) is the fastest I know of. For context, in the first 10 years of the great bear bond market, 1946-81, the yield on the long-dated Treasury eked out a gain of just 100 basis points, rising to 3¼% from 2¼%. I can think of three reasons, apart from market structure and positioning, to explain this upside lurch. No. 1 is the artificially low level from which it began; the familiar image of a beach ball shooting to the surface of the water comes to mind. No. 2 is the belated recognition of the persistence of a supposedly transient inflation. No. 3 is the recognition, also belated, of the tendency of clustered financial errors to store up credit risk for some future day. The view at Grant's is that the current batch of mistakes had its origin in suppressed interest rates and that the day of reckoning is here, or just around the cyclical bend.""
           

              
           

             We can use a more delicate phrase than an outright mugging, namely ""market failure"", which puts in an appearance in Yale Endowment CIO David Swensen's excellent guide for individual investors, 'Unconventional Success'.
           

              
           

             The title is an allusion to Keynes' famous observation that fund managers, courtesy of endemic groupthink, tend to prefer (and to deliver) conventional failure over unconventional success. Swensen himself is famous for steering the Yale endowment through many years of impressive investment returns. He uses ""market failure"" in the context of a managed fund industry that involves the interaction between sophisticated, profit-seeking providers of financial services and naive, return-seeking consumers of investment products.
           

              
           

             The drive for profits by Wall Street and the mutual fund industry overwhelms the concept of fiduciary responsibility, leading to an all too predictable outcome: except in an inconsequential number of cases where individuals succeed through unusual skill or unreliable luck, the powerful financial services industry exploits vulnerable individual investors. To Swensen,
           

              
           

             ""The ownership structure of a fund management company plays a role in determining the likelihood of investor success. Mutual fund investors face the greatest challenge with investment management companies that provide returns to public shareholders or that funnel profits to a corporate parent – situations that place the conflict between profit generation and fiduciary responsibility in high relief. When a funds management subsidiary reports to a multiline financial services company, the scope for abuse of investor capital broadens dramatically. In contrast, private for-profit investment management organizations enjoy the option of playing the role of a benevolent capitalist, mitigating the drive for profits with concern for investor returns.""
           

              
           

             The financial crisis of 2007-? has taken the role of giant vampiric money-squids masquerading as investment banks to new levels of surrealism quite beyond the realm of satire. Not content with ripping the faces off clients, banks – not limited in the scope of their operations to pure investment banking – have now shown themselves quite adept at ripping the faces off taxpayers too. If deficit exists, it is not in free market terms, because as we have seen, no such free market exists. The deficit is rather a political and regulatory one. It took 10 years or so for the waves of popular anger at the banking bailouts to wash onto the shore of popular opinion, but they eventually landed all the same. First Brexit and then the election of Donald Trump were just two of the belated consequences.
           

              
           

             The remedy, were executives and voters alike willing to behave like grown-ups, would be to return to the sort of managerial culture cited in the Hopper brothers' magisterial study of the American economic golden age, 'The Puritan Gift' (I.B. Tauris & Co, 2009). Such a return would largely banish consultants and supposed experts from the body politic and corporate, and reintroduce the iron concept of personal responsibility. The Hopper brothers' Principle Seven for good corporate practice states unequivocally: one man, one boss.

             In 'The Puritan Gift', the Hopper brothers also identify the proximate cause for the crisis as
           

              
           

             ""..an excess of borrowing by government, businesses and individuals.. Increasingly, reckless lending and borrowing – two sides of the same coin – have characterized most aspects of American [and western] society for the last thirty years..
           

              
           

             ""This abuse of credit across the whole of society coincided with, and could not have occurred without, a deterioration in corporate culture occurring in the last third of the twentieth century. In the Golden Age of Management (1920 – 1970), executives had learned the craft of management ""on the job"" from more senior colleagues. As they progressed up the ladder of promotion, they would also absorb ""domain knowledge"" about the activity for which they were responsible – to borrow a term favoured by Jeff Immelt, [the now discredited] chairman and chief executive of General Electric. Starting in the late 1960s, however, a new concept appeared on the corporate scene: that management was a profession like medicine, dentistry or the law, which people were ""licensed"" to practise at the highest level if they had studied the subject in an academic setting. Business school graduates and accountants set the pattern of behaviour; others would follow in their footsteps. In 2001 a ""professional"" manager entered the Oval Office of the White House to take charge of the nation.""
           

              
           

             Whether considering the managers of listed businesses or the managers of discretionary funds, investors should be well served by identifying those conforming to a moral as opposed to a purely self-interested approach. Decent moral behaviour is to a degree subjective, but as Justice Potter Stewart famously said of pornography, we know it when we see it. Reforming banking sector pay will only be the start of an overdue cleansing of the Augean stables. When banks compete properly for business and run the risk of genuine failure in so doing, the market will be on its way to being fixed. But as things stand, banks in collusion with central banks are distorting the term structure of debt markets (and through inflationism, all other asset markets too) and giving investors a delusional sense of safety with regard to sovereign bonds.
           

              
           

             Both financial signals and financial signalling are all wrong. When monetary policy rates and supposedly market-led interest rates are as low as they currently are it is not a sign of confidence, but rather a reflection of absolute terror on the part of the crippled institutions that have been buying them in preference to any form of more constructive lending or investment. It is a moot point as to whether the next financial crisis is now upon us, in the form of imminent financial failures by US and / or Euro zone banks and perhaps German or Italian insurers and pension funds. We would argue, rather, that the last financial crisis never got resolved in the first place. The answer, we conclude, is now to avoid paper promises by bankrupt states and institutions entirely, and to seek value in sensibly priced real assets, notably highly cash-generative but lightly indebted commodity-related companies. It's an ill form of inflation that does nobody any good."
2024-01-29,"Title:Trump's $1 Trillion Defense Budget
Article:Now favorite to win the 2024 US election...


              
           


The RACE for the White House has intensified after Donald Trump won the Iowa caucus with 51% of the vote, handily beating rivals Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, 
            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.


              
           

             This was followed by second-place winner DeSantis suspending his campaign, leaving only Trump and Haley, the ex-president's former ambassador to the United Nations. Results from the online prediction market PredictIt now show that Trump has become the betting favorite to win November's general election.
           

              
           




              
           

             Whether you support him or not, it's important for investors to consider the potential market ramifications of a possible second Trump term. One such sector that has come into focus is defense, especially in light of escalating tensions in the Middle East.
           

              
           

             In a note to investors, Piper Sandler's head of US policy research, Andy Laperriere, highlighted defense as a sector to watch should Trump or Haley win in November. In fact, Laperriere gives Haley higher marks than Trump when it comes to boosting defense spending, writing that the former South Carolina governor would be ""more focused on winning substantive legislative victories in Congress than Trump.""
           

              
           

             But then, a second Trump presidency might mean the US pulls out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) – one of Trump's longstanding priorities – in which case the US would likely need to increase military outlays. The US currently spends about 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on national defense, which is significantly higher than what most countries spend, but it trails the military buildup of the 1980s, when outlays were closer to 7% and 8% of GDP.
           

              
           

             None of this is to suggest that the military has languished under President Joe Biden. The US already outspends the next 10 countries combined, and at the end of last year, the president signed the US defense policy bill, authorizing a record $886 billion in annual military spending.
           

              
           

             But with the world's geopolitical thermostat climbing, it's easy to see this budget going even higher – even topping $1 trillion. According to US Under Secretary of Defense Mike McCord, that eye-watering Dollar amount is ""inevitable"" within just a few years.
           

              
           

             I believe this would carry clearly positive implications for defense stocks, but don't take it from me. In December, Fitch Ratings raised its outlook of the defense industry, writing that contractors ""will be supported by higher backlogs and elevated spending on national security.""
           

              
           

             That same month, the Financial Times reviewed the orderbooks of 15 global defense contractors, finding that their combined backlogs in just the first half of 2023 totaled a massive $764 billion. Governments' ""sustained spending"" on defense ""has spurred investors' interest in the sector,"" the article reads.
           

              
           

             When evaluating a defense service company and its growth potential, it's essential to spend time looking at its contract portfolio. Many of these firms have only one buyer – the federal government – which creates a unique market dynamic where competition is often less about price and more about technological and strategic superiority.
           

              
           

             Over the years, the ""Big Five"" defense contractors – Lockheed Martin, RTX, General Dynamics, Boeing and Northrop Grumman – have received about a third of the Defense Department's annual budget, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). 2022 saw a record $705 billion in military contracts, with $47 billion going to Lockheed Martin alone, more than any other company.
           

              
           

             In fiscal 2024's military budget, a whopping 58 out of 78 major weapons systems – or roughly three quarters – involve at least one of the Big Five companies as a primary contractor. (In the chart below, please note that Raytheon Technologies rebranded as RTX in June 2023.)
           

              
           




              
           

             With defense spending constituting a significant portion of the US GDP and an escalating global geopolitical landscape, the 2024 election could indeed be a defining moment for defense stocks. Investors and market observers alike are keenly watching the unfolding political developments, understanding that the election's outcome could propel the defense sector to new financial heights."
2024-01-27,"Title:2024 Brings Change, Says Bond Market
Article:Still not gold, but very useful signal...


              
           


WHILE it is far from the only important indicator for the markets, the Treasury bond yield curve (10yr-2yr) is very important, 
            writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.


              
           

             That's because it takes what is probably the most important market for macro signaling (the bond market) and gives us a view into the dynamics between short and long-term yields. In the bond market, duration means a lot.
           

              
           

             For one example, long-term bonds are much more vulnerable to inflation's negative effects than short-term bonds. Short-term bonds also act as a liquidity haven during deflationary market crises. Long-term bonds can work quite well during disinflationary times and pay out better income than short-term bonds, but in a full out deflation scare when the very system (and its exponential debt load) comes into question insofar as you want bonds, you want short-term (in my experience 1-3 year Treasury, T-bills and Treasury Money Market). In other words, relative safety.
           

              
           

             From an American perspective, as long as the government says that stuff is safe it is safe. As long as the government is intact and functioning, that is. But it is only safe because of the fact that the governing body of a society long past its shelf life of sound monetary management says so. Otherwise, it's a government operating under the dual pressure of unpayable debt (short of attempting to inflate it away) and waning confidence – with the first overt sign of revolution occurring on January 6, 2021.
           

              
           

             So, short-term Treasury bonds are safe. But short-term Treasury bonds are not really safe, are they? They sure are not gold in that regard. Unlike the trillions in debt attached to the US and many global bond and currency markets, gold has no such liability as it pays no income and is just an old rock that ancient societies used as money. It had stability in its finite quantities and the fact that it was no one else's debt. Today it is just an anchor within the storm of modern finance and in a storm you probably want your boat to be well anchored lest it be tossed to and fro and cast upon the rocks as wreckage.
           

              
           

             But the bond market is absolute gold as a macro signaler. Look no further than the Continuum chart we have used over the last 15 years to identify the correct macro backdrop at any given time. Since the 1980s, and until 2022, that backdrop was signaled to be disinflationary by definition of the gentle, robotic trend downward in long-term yields.
           

              
           




              
           

             While the entire history is not shown on this chart, the downtrend goes back to the 1980s, coming off the Volcker panic-hike regime of the 1970s after inflation got well out of control.
           

              
           

             Downtrending bond yields (uptrending bond prices) signaled 'nope, no inflation problems here' (reality might have had a different opinion, but we are talking about the signaling of a heavily manipulated market) and this was implied license for big brained Fed chair people and little brained politicians alike to create policy to inflate the system at all points of stress, let alone crisis.
           

              
           

             For many years we used the now-green moving averages (which can now be viewed as support for the new macro) as resistance to changing the macro. Those MA lines used to be red as were the arrows. They were the backbone of the long-term disinflationary trend. In 2022, something broke and in my opinion, it was a profound move that we are tasked with interpreting correctly, now and in the coming years. The decades long disinflationary trend by which inflating policymakers were given license, is over.
           

              
           

             In my opinion, if they try their old tricks on bond yield pullbacks (eg, the big pullback we've seen over the last few months or even all the way back to the moving averages) the efficacy is not going to be the magical and heroic kicks saves of the past.
           

              
           

             The implication of the bond market rebellion of 2022 is 'Enough!' In my opinion a saturation point was hit and the bond market could not sop up anymore of the chicanery (ie, inflationary bubble making by policy).
           

              
           

             The inflationary signaling of the broken Continuum does not mean inflation as far as the eye can see, however. It may mean that new deflationary episodes met with dovish policy response will no longer work as effectively as it did over previous decades. Again, the bond market says the system became choked with inflation manufactured from debt.
           

              
           

             At best, new inflationary phases may be more corrosive for more aspects of the economy and/or benefit a different set of assets, like precious metals and commodities critical to societal progress (thinking Uranium, Copper, Rare Earths, Lithium, etc). There is always a need for food/Ags as well. Ah, yes there is.
           

              
           

             Now that long-term yields have shown their hand I would no longer bet on real estate as a good long-term investment. RE was stellar during the Continuum's intact phase. In the future? There could be quick bursts of optimism on yield declines, but if the new macro holds we may not see sub-3% again in some of our lifetimes. This could grind at real estate over time.
           

              
           

             However, a new macro may cast its net globally to emerging and frontier markets, many of which are rich in natural resources, including precious metals and commodities. In essence, we might also speculate about the possibility that the world (everything bubble) is not ending but instead, is shifting...away from the over-financialized western complex that has benefited from remote monetary management (bond market manipulation), to markets that have lagged during the era of financialization. We'll look at a few charts of EM, Asia and the Frontiers in the report below.
           

              
           

             I realize that just above I sound like the BRICS-promoting/De-Dollarizing people I sometimes criticize. But the criticism is only for the 'perma' nature of those views. There is a thing called timing and another thing called activation. On a big picture, measured over years, the shift in the macro may shake out per the above and become activated.
           

              
           

             Here we have the yield curve (10yr-2yr), doing as expected and breaking upward from the latest consolidation that gave Goldilocks a new bounce in her step as silly Santa season came to an end in December. The steepening yield curve can come under pressure of deflation or inflation or, over the course of an extended steepener, both at varying times. What it will do is signal to Dorothy that ""we are not in Kansas anymore"" and likely signal pain for herds of trend followers most recently conditioned by the previous flattener into inversion. That pain could come deflationary or inflationary. It's the steepening that tends to hurt Goldilocks, one way or the other.
           

              
           




              
           

             Very generally, remember that a curve flattening comes with an economic boom and a steepening comes with a bust.
           

              
           

             The flattening of the curve had implied policy makers in full control and inflation a waning problem, as short-term bonds were not well bid in relation to long-term bonds. A steepening implies that short-term bonds are now favored. Short-term bonds are a liquidity haven, long-term bonds are risk.
           

              
           

             As for the steepening, it is heading toward de-inversion. Remember now that the media and mainstream economists have been touting the dangers to the economy of an inverted yield curve. Now that the curve has started to steepen might that not be part of the relief felt by today's 'happy days are here again!' soft landers? All along we have noted that it is not the inversion that brings on the pain. It is the steepener that follows the inversion. But why let reality get in the way of good media stories?
           

              
           

             The signaling by the yield curve is that regardless of whether it sticks to the deflationary view that has been our primary 2024 view or takes on in interim inflationary flavor (ref. Thursday's public article) Goldilocks is destined to get eaten by 3 pissed off bears. Goldilocks dies when pleasant disinflation morphs deflationary and she also expires when it morphs inflationary.
           

              
           

             Bottom line: Changes are at hand for 2024. I don't say so. The bond market says so. Our plan has been for those changes to be disinflation to a coming deflation scare. But the decline in yields since our October 'call' :-) has been significant. For reasons illustrated above, we can also be aware of something unexpected by a majority (unlike a year ago), like an interim inflation trade.
           

              
           

             The two 2024 (and beyond) options, based on the Yield Curve's new steepener and other signals are:
           

 Interim inflation trades now, deflationary episode, and then in the coming years a bigger, badder and more global inflation in an age of war, unrest, social discord and shifting monetary systems from the monetized west to the commodity/resource-rich east and EM/FM. 
 Disinflation into deflation sooner rather than later (our original plan), followed by balls out inflation that again, will not benefit those areas (eg, Western stock markets) to the degree it has previously. Commodities, resources, precious metals and EM/FM could see a new era of out-performance.

2024-01-25,"Title:China's Household Gold Buying Jumps Even as Yuan Price Hits Record
Article:Gold's No.1 consumers snap a decade of price-sensitive investing...


              
           


CHINESE HOUSEHOLDS, the world's heaviest buyers of physical gold, last year grew their purchases of gold even as the precious metal rose in price to new all-time records in terms of the Yuan as well as all other major currencies including the US Dollar.
           

              
           

             That was the first such growth on a rising gold price since 2017 for China's private-sector gold buying, and it contrasts with the past decade of 'price sensitive' action more akin to the behavior of households in India, now the world's No.2 gold consumer nation.
           

              
           

             Starting with 
            a strong Chinese New Year for gold demand, China's jewelry purchases rose 8.0% in 2023 according to new data from industry body the China Gold Association today, while demand for gold coins and small bars jumped 15.7% by weight.
           

              
           

             Together that took the total quantity of bullion in gold products bought by Chinese households 10.1% higher from 2022 to just over 1,006 tonnes, almost 82 tonnes above the previous 5-year average on the CGA data and one-third greater from the Association's figure for 2020, when the Covid pandemic and lockdowns crushed the country's retail sales.
           

              
           




              
           

             With China's stock market sinking by more than 20% in 2023 to hit 5-year lows on the CSI 300 index, last year's growth in its household demand for gold took consumer spending on bullion to a new all-time high, rising 30.5% in terms of the Chinese Yuan and 23.8% in terms of the US Dollar to more than $56 billion.
           

              
           

             That equates to 0.32% of China's total economic output, the highest proportion of GDP spent on gold bullion by Chinese households since 2016 but still only half the record level of 2013, when 
            a crash in global gold prices spurred a record jump in the volume of gold jewelry, coins and small bars bought by Chinese consumers.
           

              
           

             The People's Bank of China also reported that it chose to buy a record annual quantity of gold in 2023, adding 225 tonnes to the central bank's foreign-exchange reserves – the strongest ever growth outside of the 
            multi-year totals for PBoC gold buying reported in 2009 and then in 2015.
           

              
           

             ""Driven by a series of policies to boost retail spending,"" says 
            today's CGA release, ""China's consumer markets continue to recover"" from 
            the Covid Crash of 2020, with gold and silver jewelry becoming the fastest-growing category among all retail sectors last year.
           

              
           

             China's 
            2023 GDP data from the National Bureau of Statistics last week said that retail sales of gold, silver and jewelry rose 13.3% across the year, topping growth in sports and recreational goods (up 11.2%) and communications equipment (up 7.0%). 
           

              
           

             ""The online performance of gold jewelry sales 
            was outstanding in December,"" says news-site 
            Securities Times, quoting analysis from brokerage Wanlian that says Alibaba (HKG: 9988) last month saw a year-on-year increase of 18%, with 63% growth at No.2 online retailer JD.com (HKG: 9618) and 37% on platform SuNing (SHE: 002024).
           

              
           

             More notably still, gold investment products are seeing ""high attention"" the CGA adds today, highlighting ""rapid growth in the consumption of gold bars and gold coins with relatively low premiums"" over the wholesale bullion market price.
           

              
           

             China's private 
            gold investing demand leapt last summer, seizing on a small retreat in global prices as other investment options in the world's 2nd largest economy – from real estate to equities and cash in the bank – continued to underperform amid a slowdown in GDP growth.
           

              
           

             Wholesale bullion traded in Shanghai has already set 
            a new all-time record Chinese gold price in 2024, rising to touch ¥483 per gram last week as the Yuan fell alongside China's stock market."

             And no – we don't, as yet, have the latest data for how much sauerkraut was pickled and bottled or canned by factories in Germany in 2023.
           

              
           

             But if the relationship with the Dax index held strong, then it was probably a lot!
           

              
           

             Still, correlation isn't causation of course, as 
            spoil-sport scientists like to say.
           

              
           

             (Nor, by the way, can you trade top sauerkraut brand Hengstenberg on the Frankfurt stock market either. It's a privately-owned, family-run business.)
           

              
           

             But don't let such boring facts ruin your fun. Nor your next hot investment tip.
           

              
           

             I mean, who knew that US households love to go shopping when the price of cookies goes up?
           

              
           

             Yes, it's true. Based on monthly data, US retail spending shows a 0.91 correlation across the last 10 years with the average price of chocolate chip cookies.
           

              
           

             Quite how this connection works, I can't guess. A sugar rush maybe? But that figure – simply taking the 'r' coefficient across all months since 2014 – would read 1.00 if 
            cookie prices and total retail spending moved precisely in lockstep. They'd move exactly opposite if it read minus 1.00 instead.
           

              
           

             So the reading of +0.91 must mean something, right? Over the past 10 years, it's been stronger than the correlation of US retail sales with the price of ground beef (0.82) or with sliced bacon (0.83) or with potatoes (0.84) or even – get this – with the price of gold bullion (0.87).
           

              
           

             Trust me. I did the maths. No-one else was going to.
           

              
           

             In fact, the cookie-retail correlation is so strong, it almost matches the well-known and much-reported relationship between the price of gold and the total amount of debt owed by the US federal government and – therefore – owed by US taxpayers.
           

              
           




              
           

             No doubt you've seen this chart before. Or something like it.
           

              
           

             Lots of analysts, pundits and salesmen like to compare the development of gold prices with the growth in America's total national debt.
           

              
           

             And why not? Since the year 2000 they have both gone up. A lot.
           

              
           

             ""US national debt just crossed above $34 trillion for the first time, the equivalent of $101,000 per citizen or $264,000 per taxpayer,"" says fund manager Frank Holmes at US Global Investors, 
            posting the chart above.
           

              
           

             ""Since the start of this century, national debt and gold have shared a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.9. In simple terms, this means that both have tended to make similar moves day-to-day.
           

              
           

             ""[So] if you think debt is headed higher, it may make sense to consider an investment in physical gold and gold mining stocks.""
           

              
           

             Simple, right? A bit too simple perhaps? 
           

              
           

             Over a period of months or years, any 2 things which have both risen in value are pretty much certain to show a positive correlation when you run the numbers through ""=CORREL"" on an Excel spreadsheet.
           

              
           

             But that doesn't mean that they moved together in the meantime. On the contrary, they might have moved opposite more often than not.
           

              
           
 Table of gold price correlations

             This table tracks the gold price in Dollars, month-end data, against a range of other investment assets and economic factors.
           

              
           


               
            

               
            


               The first column shows you the 'simple' correlation. It calculates the 'r' coefficient between the price of gold in Dollars with US government debt – as well as with the different investment assets and other economic factors listed – across the last 120 months.
             

                
             

               The second column, in contrast, looks at the correlation across each and every 12-month period. It then shows you the typical 12-month reading of the 'r' coefficient given across the last 10 years.
             

                
             

               See how it changes?
             

                
             

               Then in Column 3, you get the r-squared of that average correlation – a really boring spoilsport number which double checks the 'r' to see how closely 2 things are really correlated. See how, for most of the relationships in our table, it completely undermines the shock-horror value of our first reading in Column 1?
             

                
             

               Take the Nasdaq index of US corporate shares, for instance.
             

                
             

               Across the past 10 years as a whole, the Nasdaq shows a very strong r-coefficient with gold of +0.91. But that only really shows how stocks, like gold, have risen long-term. And within those 10 years, the Nasdaq typically showed next to no correlation with the price of gold.
             

                
             

               The median 12-month reading was in fact slightly negative. Very slightly. And it sinks pretty much to zero on the r-squared.
             

                
             

               ""In finance, an R-squared above 70% would generally be 
              seen as showing a high level of correlation,"" says Investopedia, ""whereas a measure below 40% would show a low correlation. This is not a hard rule, however, and will depend on the specific analysis.""
             

                
             

               Put another way however, as one genuine statistics expert does, ""Some fields of study have an inherently greater amount of unexplainable variation. In these areas, your R2 values are 
              bound to be lower. For example, studies that try to explain human behavior generally have R2 values less than 50%.
             

                
             

               ""People are just harder to predict than things like physical processes"" in short. And gold-market prices, like equities or Bitcoin or even the size of the US federal debt, are very human at root.
             

                
             

               Now contrast the Nasdaq with silver. Even though, in the first column above, silver's headline price correlation with gold is good and strong at +0.85, that reading comes below US government debt, below the Nasdaq, and below the CPI cost-of-living index, too.
             

                
             

               But drill into the data, and silver's ancient and continued relationship with the price of gold jumps out. Because on the median 12-month reading, silver shows the strongest correlation in our sample, and its r-squared with gold is streets ahead of anything else here.
             

                
             

               Next strongest? Real yields, meaning the rate of interest over and above the pace of inflation, offered by 10-year inflation-protected Treasury bonds. That median 12-month 'r' with gold comes in at minus 0.64, a strongly negative reading that signals a much more powerful connection than gold prices show with Bitcoin, for instance. Yet across the past 10 years as a whole, the real yield shows a much weaker connection in Column One.
             

                
             

               Real yields' solid r-squared with gold also masks the big shock of gold's price action so far this decade...
             

                
             

               ...a shock which analysts, traders and pundits continue to highlight...
             

                
             

               ...gasping at how gold has shrugged off the steepest rise in real yields since pretty much forever, rising to new all-time highs against all major currencies and holding close to its all-time record highs in real terms, after you account for inflation, even as the real rate offered by TIPS bonds has jumped.
             

                
             




                
             

               Correlations come and go over time. And even when they hold firm, looking at just one measure across one time frame doesn't show you the whole picture.
             

                
             

               Nor does looking at the correlation of just one thing against one other thing, either.
             

                
             

               US stocks, for instance, show a slightly stronger 10-year correlation with the US national debt than even gold does, up at 0.97 against gold's reading of 0.96 across the past 120 months.
             

                
             

               More notably over the last 10 years, the Nasdaq's median 12-month correlation with the US national debt is very much stronger than gold's.
             

                
             

               It reads 0.69 against gold's figure of 0.50, and that gives the Nasdaq an r-squared relationship with US national debt of 48%, beating even gold's rolling 12-month r-squared with the real interest rates on US TIPS bonds.
             

                
             

               But who ever told you to buy US stocks because of runaway US government borrowing?
             

                
             

               Still, the continuing correlation of gold prices to the US national debt bears study. So as Frank Holmes at US Global Investors says, ""I believe [US government debt] is a good place to look if you want to know where gold may be headed in the coming months and years.""
             

                
             

               BullionVault users are starting to agree. Our latest survey of what customers are thinking found that, when asked to 
              name the biggest driver of precious metals' prices for 2024, bullion investors put 'Monetary policy' at No.1 with 25.0% of all votes.
             

                
             

               Close behind came 'Geopolitics' at 22.0% and then, just behind in 3rd place, sits 'Government spending (and the size of government deficits)' at 20.8%...
             

                
             

               ...its highest-ever reading in our twice-annual survey starting a decade ago.
             

                
             

               Sum it all up, and 'Politics' wins hands down as the big driver of precious metals prices in 2024 according to BullionVault users, whether at central banks, at the finance ministry, or at the department of defence (and attack).
             

                
             

               So far the market seems to agree, because a Happy New Year this isn't.
             

                
             

               Maybe a sugar-filled snack would help? Or failing that, some sauerkraut?"
2024-01-22,"Title:Inflationary Yield Curve Steepening?
Article:Goldilocks might prove to have been so 2023...

 AFTER a gentle disinflationary easing (Goldilocks), the bond market is hinting at an inflationary steepening of the 10yr-2yr yield curve, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 A yield curve can steepen under inflationary or deflationary pressure.
 Inflationary: Generally, long-term yields rise in relation to short-term yields as both rise nominally, or more importantly long-term yields rise nominally. Deflationary: Short-term yields decline in relation to long-term yields, as both decline nominally.
 Thus far during the Goldilocks phase from the stock market lows in October, the signal has been disinflationary relief as the 10 year Treasury bond yield dropped from near 5% to 3.8%.
 The 2 year Treasury bond yield has also dropped from the October high. But the yield curve, which is the product of the two yields above, shows the steepener still in progress after we noted in last week's public article that the recent Goldilocks-friendly easing in the curve was merely a consolidation on the way to further steepening.
 Now the break from consolidation is furthered and the steepening continues. It continues with the nominal yields shown above rising. Hence, a little inflationary hint that will obviously need follow through in order to play out.
 
 The decline in yields from October to December represented the best Goldilocks had to offer in 2023 as our original thesis of pleasant disinflation played out, Goldilocks style, at various times in 2023. It was a perfect accelerant for the anticipated seasonal (Q4) party atmosphere, built on relief from a hawkish Fed as inflation signals faded from the macro.
 In a recent NFTRH, we began a very preliminary theme whereby the writer did not want to get caught in a self-congratulatory feedback loop, due to the correct disinflationary/Goldilocks call a year ago.
 With the caveats of a still-bouncing US Dollar and a bull-poised Gold/Silver ratio, the following was noted in the report's opening Summary segment:
 ""Inflation: As always, there is much more to be factored than one public article can illustrate. But 2023 was disinflationary, on cue, and today's soft-landers and Goldilocks adherents were the inflation-phobes of a year ago.
 ""You see? Some aspects are coming into play for an unexpected – if interim to a real deflation phase – inflationary phase. I am sure fiscal authorities will stand ready in support to try to boost the incumbent party in power, and the only trick in their book is and has been, fiscally stimulated inflation. With the Fed sitting soft on the sidelines, that in itself would also be a tailwind. A hard deflation could be pushed out until post-election.""
 ""The strategy? We will manage that weekly in NFTRH reports and during the week in NFTRH+ updates. But consider this; what are commonly referred to as the 'inflation trades' in commodity and resources related speculations, have already been hammered, much like the 2020 disinflation stuff like ARK funds and Cloud/SaaS got croaked prior to Goldilocks, which re-lifted those boats.
 ""If the macro flips inflationary – even if only for a phase – the nearly sunken 'inflation trade' boats could sail again...for a phase, at least.""
 It is still very preliminary analysis. But my spidey sense says 'Gary, don't over-stay your disinflationary view'. Now let's see if the indicators back that notion up.
 If the yield curve resumes its steepening as expected and if that steepening is inflationary, as has been the little hint since mid-December, those confident about a Goldilocks style soft landing will be disappointed and maybe even those willing to deploy trades in the opposite direction of 2023's disinflationary backdrop may find success."
2024-01-19,"Title:Time for Shipping Stocks?
Article:Red Sea violence hits global traffic...

 GROWING tensions in the Red Sea, a crucial artery for international trade, have sparked a significant shift in the shipping industry, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 This shift, I believe, offers a compelling case for global shipping stocks.
 As many readers are already aware, Iran-backed Houthis have recently attacked tankers and cargo vessels sailing through the Red Sea, a passage used by about 12% of global trade. These disruptions, which are related to the Israel-Hamas War, have prompted shippers to seek alternative, though costlier, routes, including around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.
 The detour has had an immediate impact: soaring container freight rates. Since tensions escalated last month, global rates have nearly doubled, a clear indicator of the increased costs incurred by carriers and passed on to exporters.
 According to Drewry data, a company that paid about $1,400 to ship a 40-foot container at the end of November 2023 can now expect to pay more than $2,600 to ship the very same container.
 
 Shares of shipping companies have jumped as a result. For the one-month period through January 9, Israel's ZIM Integrated Shipping surged over 73%, the highest of any company in the Solactive Global Shipping Index.
 Other top performers were Hapag-Lloyd, up 37% over the same period; AP Moller-Maersk, up 28%; and China's Cosco Shipping, with a 14% return.
 
 The financial implications of the detours are substantial. An extended round trip between Asia and northern Europe is believed to cost an additional $1 million in fuel per vessel, and given the strategic importance of the Suez Canal, the rerouting of ships adds significant delays to cargo shipments, further inflating costs.
 Remember the March 2021 incident where the Ever Given container ship ran aground in the Suez Canal? The six-day episode cost the global economy an estimated $9.6 billion a day. The current standoff in the Red Sea could have a similarly profound economic impact, albeit spread out over a longer period.
 The timing is also particularly sensitive, as China's Lunar New Year approaches – a period traditionally marked by an increase in shipping demand. Even before the Houthi attacks, Maersk warned customers of ""exorbitant"" rates, ""additional peak season surcharges"" and a ""shortage of empty containers"" related to the Chinese holiday.
 The cost implications are already visible. Rates for shipping goods from Asia to the Mediterranean and North America's East Coast have risen sharply. We believe this trend is likely to continue.
 The strategic significance of the Red Sea and Suez Canal cannot be overstated. These routes not only link Europe with Asia's major suppliers but also facilitate a substantial portion of the world's crude oil and oil products transport. The diversion of tanker cargoes further escalates the demand for shipping, thereby increasing the ton-mile requirement, a key measure in the shipping industry.
 In a recent note to investors, Bank of America outlined a ""doomsday scenario"" in which both the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, responsible for about 5% of global trade, become impassable. Such an event would ""boost fleet demand between 1-2%,"" among other ramifications, Bank of America analysts wrote.
 Accurate or not, the current standoff presents a unique opportunity for investors to consider global shipping stocks, in my opinion. The hostilities are reshaping the logistics of international trade, leading to higher costs and extended transit times. The situation is likely to persist, offering a potentially lucrative method for investors seeking to capitalize on these developments."
2024-01-17,"Title:Boeing's Double Disaster
Article:Stock in relentless descent...

 WHAT happened to Boeing, the former gold standard of American industry? asks Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Nothing good, as I'll show you today.
 Simply put, Boeing isn't the company it used to be.
 By now, I'm sure you've heard about the Jan. 6 near crash of a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines, after the fuselage door blew off the plane. That caused decompression and the use of emergency oxygen.
 The door blew out because of a door-plug failure at about 16,000 feet. At that altitude, temperatures are freezing, and oxygen is quite low relative to sea level.
 The oxygen masks deployed, and passengers were able to secure them and hope for the best as the pilots tried to land the plane safely.
 An altitude of 16,000 feet is practically the highest altitude that the passengers and crew could have survived the ordeal. At altitudes of 20,000 or higher, the depressurization would have caused extreme instability and possibly crashed the plane.
 It's also likely that passengers and crew would have passed out before being able to secure the oxygen masks. At 30,000 feet, just slightly higher than the summit of Mount Everest, the plane certainly would have crashed.
 Fortunately, the plane landed safely with only minor injuries despite badly shaken nerves.
 The fuselage door detaching was not the only disaster that occurred in those frightening minutes. The depressurization also caused the cockpit door to blow open, which exposed the pilots to the extreme wind and noise going on in the back of the plane at a time when they were desperately trying to stage an emergency landing.
 Cockpit doors have been required to be highly secure and open from inside the cockpit only since the 9/11 hijackings. This was an added shock to the pilots at a critical time.
 Boeing later lamely explained that the cockpit door is supposed to blow open during an extreme depressurization incident. But they never put that critical detail in the operating manual, and the pilots on the Alaska Airlines flight had no idea that would happen. Neither did many experts and engineers who were consulted by the media.
 This separate critical incident will only add to the scrutiny, liability and criticism that Boeing is now experiencing for what is seen as gross incompetence.
 The double-door blowouts on the 737 Max 9 were bad enough. Of course, this comes not long after the double crashes of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in Indonesia in October 2018 and Ethiopia in March 2019. These were due to software flaws that put the planes into dives that pilots hadn't been trained to counter.
 Boeing's global fleet of 737 Max 8 planes were grounded at that time. However, Boeing was seen as slow to respond after the first crash. It was really the airlines themselves that took the lead in grounding their own planes.
 Boeing vowed internal investigations and improvements in quality control at that time. The flaws were subsequently corrected, but obviously problems remain. Here we are just five years later with another quality control fiasco grounding another fleet of aircraft.
 The plane involved in the latest incident was basically brand-new. It wasn't an older aircraft that experienced metal fatigue.
 According to news reports, both Boeing and Alaska Airlines had some indications that there were difficulties with the door plugs on the fuselage door.
 Since the 737 Max 9 is a relatively new model and the particular plane that suffered the door failure was, again, almost brand-new, engineers decided to ignore the warnings as just a kink that sometimes appears in new equipment and will self-correct or be easily adjusted.
 This was not the case; the manufacturer and operator were both receiving warnings of a potential catastrophic failure that they chose to ignore.
 Boeing has now grounded its entire global fleet of 737 Max 9s, about 170 aircraft in all.
 Where did it all start going wrong for Boeing? You can trace the answer to its 1997 merger with rival aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas. That changed Boeing's culture, and for the worse.
 Boeing was known for its strong emphasis on engineering and quality control. It was part of the company's ethos.
 McDonnell Douglas, on the other hand, placed special emphasis on cost cutting and financial innovations to improve its bottom line. It's not that it completely neglected quality control or that it didn't care about safety. Obviously, airplane manufacturers can't afford to disregard them.
 It's just that it placed relatively greater emphasis on financial considerations than Boeing.
 But after the merger, the McDonnell Douglas model began to encroach on Boeing's traditional ethos. The engineering department was greatly reduced, for example, while the financial engineers went to work.
 Starting in 2010, Boeing spent tens of billions on stock buybacks and other financial machinations to enhance its share price. At the same time, the company took on massive amounts of debt.
 Boeing's new CEO, Harry Stonecipher, even cited all this as a feature, not a bug. He was proud of it.
 He said, ""When people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent – so run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.""
 What was the result? Safety issues that resulted in two crashes and the latest close call. As one Boeing engineer who worked on the 737 Max said in 2019:
 This program was a much more intense pressure cooker than I've ever been in. The company was trying to avoid costs and trying to contain the level of change. They wanted the minimum change to simplify the training differences, minimum change to reduce costs and to get it done quickly.
 The irony is that by attempting to cut costs, Boeing has suffered great costs.
 Legal liability will be enormous. Business losses will also be huge based on grounding the entire fleet, identifying the defects and repairing them on all of the existing planes as well as making assembly adjustments to any work in progress.
 New safety protocols will have to be developed to make sure the problem does not reoccur, and pilots, crews and ground personnel will have to be retrained to look for future problems. The airlines will suffer losses from the groundings and will seek recourse from Boeing.
 Boeing stock fell from $265 per share on Dec. 15 to $227 per share after the incident (about a 15% decline in three weeks).
 Has Boeing's stock already taken its hit on this fiasco? The answer is no. The market price has adjusted somewhat but the investigations are ongoing, and the costs of responding are being grossly underestimated.
 Markets can be partly efficient but are not highly efficient and sometimes get taken in by ""all clear"" narratives put out by Wall Street that are far from the truth.
 This story has much longer to run, more negative facts will emerge, management changes are likely and the stock has much further to fall. I wouldn't be buying Boeing right now."

Article:You know who to blame, right...?

 WRITING for the Brownstone Institute at the end of December 2023, Jeffrey Tucker offers a synopsis of the US' recent past, says Tim Price of Price Value Partners.
 It is not an auspicious review:
 ""As we approach the end of the year, we are surrounded by a cultural and economic darkness this generation has never seen before. Most incredibly, public health itself is wrecked.
 ""Let's just count the ways. Each consequence dates from the beginnings of the lockdowns. That was the turning point, the end of innocence, the great reset, the moment when the choice between freedom and despotism weighed heavily in the most inhumane direction.
 ""Consider:
 ""Homeless people are everywhere at record highs (650K), stemming from rampant mental disorder, substance abuse, and incredibly tight leasing standards stemming from the eviction moratorium.
 ""The middle class can no longer afford to buy a home thanks to high rates from the Fed, deployed in an attempt to mitigate against inflation which is still running hot.
 ""Every merchant has hidden fees in everything, struggling to find some way to hide the hot potato of inflation that has eaten 20-plus percent of the Dollar's purchasing power since 2019.
 ""Shoplifting is a major national problem to the point that thousands of stores have closed.
 ""Shrinkflation affects everything. The groceries have shrunk and the bills have soared – a direct consequence of some $8 trillion in stimulus and money printing.
 ""Office real estate in large cities is approaching an accounting crisis because people are not returning to work, their routines totally shattered by lockdowns.
 ""Travel is uncertain with endless delays and cancellations due to pilot shortages stemming from stay-at-home orders, vaccine mandates, and rampant illness.
 ""The 'great reset' is all around us, as we are constantly nudged to drive EVs, live without comforts, buy less meat, and even eat bugs.
 ""A wide-open Southern border has created an immigration crisis as government neglected its core duties in favor of insane methods of virus control.
 ""Restaurants are unaffordable for most people.
 ""Dependency on government handouts is 28 percent higher than in 2019.
 ""All stores close an hour or two earlier because they cannot get workers to stay later.
 ""The learning losses among the kids are unfathomable, two years and rising, and perhaps an entire generation is lost.
 ""There is a population-wide mental-health crisis in addition to rampant substance abuse.
 ""The federal budget has been blown to smithereens.
 ""Political divisions are festering as never before, with neither party willing to discuss the Covid elephant in the room.
 ""Our conception of what it means to live in freedom with a government that knows limits to its power has slipped away.
 ""Arts venues are struggling for dear life to survive.
 ""World trade is shattered, with new trading blocs replacing the old ones.
 ""The rise of maniacal gender dysphoria of the young is probably connected with this: endless hours online, loss of confidence in the world as it is, plus loneliness.
 ""One could argue that even the war in Israel and Gaza is a result: security concerns were neglected in favor of microbial activism and shot mandates, and the loss of a moral center to policy then unleashed successive rounds of violence.
 ""Finally, there is the loss of trust in everything: government, public health, pharmaceuticals, academia, science, media, and each other. Society cannot function without trust. Not even churches are immune from broad incredulity since most went along with the Covid response in every detail.
 ""This only begins to scratch the surface of what we've lost and what has replaced it. Ultimately all such tragedies come down to individual lives. These days you hear them only among friends and families. And they are terrible stories of sadness and personal despair. The pain is only intensified by the silence on the part of all corporate media, government, and other commanding heights. Because of the news block on the whole topic, there is mass and festering anger beneath the surface.""
 We know where to point fingers. US and global alphabet agencies, unaccountable lobby groups with the pompous adjective 'World' affixed to their names, the UN, its laughable 2030 Agenda for Sustainable [sic] Development...
 All of these agents of malevolent cretinocracy can be summarised simply as the grim return of the Big State.
 ""The state is a human institution, not a superhuman being. He who says 'state' means coercion and compulsion. He who says: There should be a law concerning this matter, means: The armed men of the government should force people to do what they do not want to do, or not to do what they like. He who says: This law should be better enforced, means: The police should force people to obey this law. He who says: The state is God, deifies arms and prisons. The worship of the state is the worship of force. There is no more dangerous menace to civilization than a government of incompetent, corrupt, or vile men. The worst evils which mankind ever had to endure were inflicted by bad governments. The state can be and has often been in the course of history the main source of mischief and disaster."" (Ludwig von Mises, 'Omnipotent Government', 1944, Chapter 3).
 Our formal brief, though, is not to advocate for political causes, but rather to act as responsible stewards of our clients' valuable capital. This is not as easy as it sounds in an environment of deeply unsound money and in the run-up to monetary system regime change.
 Monetary systems change all the time. They changed in 1914, for example, when the combatant powers all abandoned the gold standard, because staying on it whilst continuing to prosecute the war would have bankrupted them almost immediately. (Sound money saves lives.) They changed for the UK in September 1992 when the pound sterling was ethnically cleansed from Europe's exchange rate mechanism because the UK could no longer bear to maintain the peg with the Deutsche Mark. And they will change in the months and years to come as the world increasingly comes to realise that the Petro-dollar is no longer the indisputed unchallengeable force in global finance given the offensive scale of the US' unpayable debt burden.
 So we seek safer harbours in assets (not the Big State's liabilities) that are independent, scarce and permanent – gold and silver amongst them.
 Arguably the most important short assembly of words in the English language is the phrase 'This Too Shall Pass'. Consider, for example, the cultural and economic situation of Britain in the 1970s. Stéphane Porion ('Reassessing a turbulent decade'):
 ""Britain was hit throughout the 1970s by skyrocketing inflation and unemployment (stagflation, in other words), a wide range of strikes, power cuts, and states of emergency. Trade unions could be called 'robber barons', as they opposed the Conservatives' statutory incomes policy and brought down the Conservative government, thereby answering the question asked by Edward Heath, when he called a general election in February 1974: 'Who Governs Britain?'
 ""After 1975 they were also deemed responsible for tearing to pieces Labour's Social Contract, paving the way for the 1978-1979 Winter of Discontent which in turn sealed the Labour Party's defeat. British people suffered from a sense of despair and pessimism, while Britain struggled in the 1973 oil crisis and, on the brink of bankruptcy in 1976, was forced to ask for a loan from the IMF. At the same time, academics started to argue that the country was 'ungovernable' or 'dying', while the power of the trade unions seemed impossible to curb.""
 Or, as Dominic Sandbrook puts it ('State of Emergency: The Way We Were'):
 ""The defining characteristics of the Seventies were economic disaster, terrorist threats, corruption in high places, prophecies of ecological doom and fear of the surveillance state's suffocating embrace. The 1970s have merely been lurking, like a mad woman in the attic, waiting for a suitable moment when they can re-emerge and scare us out of our wits all over again.""
 And then, at the 1979 General Election, Margaret Thatcher was elected, and she would go on to become the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century.
 That we do not yet see the Margaret Thatcher of 2024 does not mean that she, or he, is not out there, quietly mustering resistance to the corrupt predations of the overlarge State. The unique energy of the genuine free market – as opposed to the crony corporatism that has largely held sway these last four years – is an endless capacity for reinvention.
 ""This, too, shall pass."""
2024-01-13,"Title:America's Progress: Galloping Debt, Crawling Growth
Article:Just how does a nation go bust...?

 SLOWLY. Then rapidly...says Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 Back in 1981 – 205 years after the nation's birth – its debt first scaled $1 trillion.
 That is, the business was the work of 205 years.
 Today the work of 205 years reduces not to centuries...not to decades...not to years...but to months.
 Consider: The nation's debt attained an existingly delirious $33 trillion in September 2023.
 In January 2024 – a mere four months following the calamity – the national debt gallops to $34 trillion.
 Four months!
 No – under four months. The $33 trillion embarrassment was not attained until mid-September.
 The $34 trillion enormity was attained the opening week of January.
 Impossible. But there it is.
 In January 2020 the Congressional Budget Office divined the nation's debt would scale $34 trillion in 2029.
 A five-year misunderestimation!
 Yet that divination preceded the fantastic fiscal deluges attending the pandemic.
 In 2024 the torrents have scarcely relented. Eric Boehm of Reason magazine:
 ""The debt has grown faster due to the unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus unleashed during the pandemic and because baseline federal spending has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels. In the fiscal year that ended in September, the federal government spent $6.1 trillion, up from $4.4 trillion in fiscal year 2019 (the last one before the pandemic). Federal revenue has climbed in recent years as well – $4.4 trillion last year, up from $3.5 trillion in 2019 – but those increases haven't been large enough to keep up with the surge in new spending.""
 Has the pandemic not ended? Have not its savage lockdowns likewise ended?
 Both have ended, yes. Why – then – cannot the government of the United States revert to pre-pandemic spending?
 That 2019 spending was already lunatic. Why must the government of the United States sustain pandemic levels of fiscal lunacy in the post-pandemic period?
 In neither law nor equity can we discern an explanation. That is, in neither law nor equity can we discern a compelling explanation.
 The business nonetheless proceeds – without let, without hindrance. Michael Peterson of the Peterson Foundation:
 ""Looking ahead, debt will continue to skyrocket as the Treasury expects to borrow nearly $1 trillion more by the end of March.""
 Slowly. Then rapidly.
 The business begins to assume an exponential aspect.
 That is, it begins to increase at an increasing gait.
 Two hundred and five years to attain a $1 trillion debt, 10 years to attain a $3 trillion in debt, 10 additional years to attain a $6 trillion debt, 10 years after that to attain a $15 trillion debt, 10 additional years to attain a $27 trillion debt, three years to attain a $33 trillion debt, under four months to attain a $34 trillion debt.
 Here is progress – of a very peculiar sort.
 How long until the nation's debt surpasses $35 trillion? Three months – or less?
 How about $36 trillion after that? Then $40 trillion? Then $50 trillion?
 A $50 trillion economy can withstand a $36 trillion debt burden. It can likely withstand a $40 trillion burden.
 If the gods are kind...it may even withstand a $50 trillion debt burden.
 But the United States economy is not a $50 trillion economy. It is – perhaps – a $27 trillion economy.
 Is economic expansion maintaining pace with this mushrooming debt?
 Alas...it is not.
 Set to one side the rebound year of 2021. Not since 2005 has the gross domestic product exceeded 3% annual expansion.
 Meantime, the Congressional Budget Office projects average 1.8% annual growth through 2033.
 That is: Debt gallops, growth crawls.
 Thus, as we have argued before: The Keynesian ""multiplier"" – the miracle of water into wine – has taken up division.
 It remains a multiplier only within the economics departments of ivied institutions and castles very high in the sky.
 A certain Maya MacGuineas, presides over the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (do not laugh!). From whom:
 ""Though our level of debt is dangerous for both our economy and for national security, America just cannot stop borrowing. This is a moment of consequence and continuing to refuse to pay our own bills will not lead us to where we need to be as a nation.""
 Where do we need to be as a nation? We do not know.
 Perhaps the gutter?
 The United States government – the taxpayers of the United States, that is – presently shovel out $2 billion each day to service existing debt.
 How much more must they shovel out as the nation's debt takes its exponential leaps?
 We do not know. Yet the figure will be plenty handsome. Reports Mr. Bezos and his Washington Post:
 Interest costs are already the fastest-growing part of the budget. Net interest costs – a nonnegotiable expense – nearly doubled as a share of federal outlays between 2020 and 2023, going from $345 billion, or 5%, to $660 billion, or 10%. (Defense, by comparison, cost $815 billion, or 13% of spending in 2023.)
 Perhaps democracy dies not in darkness as Mr.Bezos claims – but in debt.
 What will be left for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, national offense and the rest of it?
 How will the United States afford its bread and its circuses?
 At the going rate...only with fantastic and herculean exertions.
 Meantime, some 30% of United States government debt is poised to mature this year.
 Much of this debt was taken on in a regime of drastically lower interest rates.
 Upon maturation it must be refinanced at today's elevated rates. Consider for example the 3-month Treasury bill.
 The thing yielded nearly nothing in 2021. It presently yields over 5%.
 Meantime, the 10-year Treasury note yielded 0.50% in the hell-sent summer of 2020.
 It presently yields 4%.
 For years and years the boy has yelled wolf.
 At $1 trillion of debt, at $2 trillion of debt, at every other trillion – now at $34 trillion.
 But the wolf has yet to appear. It has merely cast phantom shadows.
 We do not know when the snarling wolf will ultimately appear upon the stoop.
 Yet as noted above, the exponential function begins to apply.
 With it, the cascading effect – the spiraling effect.
 Slowly. Then rapidly..."
2024-01-12,"Title:Bitcoin ETFs: When Moon? Not Soon, Says Gold
Article:Gold's warning from history. And BTC's too...


              
           


So BITCOIN ETFs finally got approved by the SEC, writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault, with chief regulator Gary Gensler penning a press release so grudging, you'd think the applicants had just driven over his dog.
           

              
           

             Still, you remember the old Wall Street saying, right?
           

              
           

             ""Buy the rumor, sell the news."" 
           

              
           

             It worked a charm for gold traders back in the mid-1970s. The old chestnut also worked for Bitcoin fans in 2017 – just like, well, 
            some people said. But again, only if the hodlers sold the hype rather than buying it, before prepping for the moon once again at much lower prices.
           

              
           

             Two-thirds lower, in fact, inside 7 weeks.
           

              
           

             Gold didn't quite make that plunge in 1975. But like Bitcoin over the past decade or so, its volatility made it the Seventies' hottest asset bar none (well, hottest besides 
            silver in the Hunt brothers' corner).
           

              
           

             In 1974 alone gold had doubled on a tide of hope and hype, long before 
            gold-backed ETFs like the SPDR product (NYSEArca: GLD) were even a twinkle in the eye of mining or finance-industry executives.
           

              
           




              
           

             Runaway inflation sure helped. So did 
            the Federal Reserve's timid response.
           

              
           

             More urgently for gold in 1974, and previewing the kind of hype just seen around Bitcoin ETFs from ARKB to BITB and IBIT and the rest, Washington was finally set to 
            end the 4-decade ban on US citizens owning and trading bullion coins or bars of the yellow metal. Most urgent of all in the 1970s, that meant gold futures trading could get started on US financial exchanges as well.
           

              
           

             ""The leverage available is large,"" said the 
            New York Times just before 31st December, when 4 exchanges were going to launch gold contracts to an eager US public.
           

              
           

             ""For example, the New York Mercantile Exchange, which offers the smallest contract, has a minimum margin requirement of only $500 for a 32‐ounce contract [then] worth perhaps $6,400.""
           

              
           

             Derivatives brokers rushed to get ready, albeit limiting the 
            ""speculative debut of gold futures"" to what the world would now call 'high net worth' punters. To sate the rest of the 
            lumpeninvestoriat, banks and dealers and retailers all rushed to stockpile gold coins and small bars ahead of the big day.
           

              
           

             Because yes! It's finally happening!! Here we go!!!
           

              
           

             But no. Gold actually fell as 1975 began. By the summer of 1976, it had almost halved in price, down from near-$200 per Troy ounce towards $100, back where it had ended 1973.
           

              
           




              
           

             Fast forward 4 decades, and the hottest number-go-up of the 2010s was all set for a moonshot too.
           

              
           

             Again, the idea of leveraged betting lit the fuse. The launch of 
            Bitcoin futures contracts – announced that August by the Chicago Board Options Exchange – would surely send the crypto-currency higher than anyone dare dream. Which they did on their advent, only to see the thing crash almost the moment they became flesh.
           

              
           

             Ahead of the CBOE launch, Bitcoin in 2017 mooned a lot faster than gold had in 1975. Maybe cos it's weightless? Maybe cos the rocket-fuel of cheap money was now fired through the boosters of social media hype and shysters?
           

              
           

             Either way, the ""future of money"" leapt 19-fold in 2017 as crypto's own ""big day"" drew near. The start of the XBT futures contract meant, to quote one true believer, that ""Institutional corporate money is now about to enter the land of Bitcoin!"" Cue lots of money to chase the thing higher in advance.
           

              
           

             Bitcoin rose 56% inside one week that December, fast out-running anything gold has ever achieved as the CBOE's launch-day for legally approved leveraged BTC trading approached.
           

              
           

             But then, when the rumor became a fact?
           

              
           




              
           

             After BTC USD surged 20 times in price ahead of the CBOE futures launch, it really wasn't that hard to guess what came next. Any idiot could do it (
            and did).
           

              
           

             But here in 2024, Bitcoin's ETF approvals are playing out differently so far. Which makes guessing what comes next much harder.
           

              
           

             Oh sure, the promoters got busy. After all, they've had 11 years of practice since the least sympathetic characters in 
            The Social Network were 
            first rebuked by US regulators at the SEC after asking it to sign off exchange-traded products backed by holding BTC.
           

              
           

             And sure, the true believers on social media has been working overtime too. Mostly 
            summed up as ""HERE WE GO!!!""...
           

              
           

             ...or ""Mega #btc explosion 
            coming""...
           

              
           

             ...or adding a little variety by claiming that 'China' is desperate to get into BTC ETFs too, creating 
            such wonderful word soup as ""Full nation state adoption game theory in effect.""
           

              
           

             But this time, instead of mooning ahead of the fact, Bitcoin has struggled to extend the up-move it started in late-2022. Finally bottoming 75% beneath its new Covid stimmy-check peak of 12 months before, Bitcoin has gone on to reach 21-month highs. Yet take-off day this week – when the SEC finally admitted 
            what its own errant tweet had said a day earlier, and announcing the move several hours after US brokerages began listing the 11 new Bitcoin ETF products on their retail-investor platforms – found BTC rising barely 1.0% higher out in the wild (the kind of move it's beaten, up or down, on nearly 2-in-3 of all days across the last decade) while the now-live ETFs actually dropped in price.
           

              
           

             Still, this all ""demonstrates Bitcoin is winning"". Or so 2024's hodlers 
            want to believe. ""The existing financial system is being pulled into its black hole.
           

              
           

             ""To. the. f**king. moon.""
           

              
           

             But Bitcoin didn't moon in advance of the new US products, and it hasn't (so far) mooned on their launch either. What's more, Bitcoin ETFs in themselves aren't new. Canada got a bunch starting in November 2021, with the Purpose Bitcoin CAD ETF (TSE: BTCC.B) followed by Fidelity's product (TSE:FBTC). It carried (and still carries) an expense ratio of 0.95% for keeping its crypto stacked in Fidelity's own cold storage in-house. It turned $10,000 invested into $3,000 within 12 months, recovering to $8,230 today with around US$140m of assets.
           

              
           

             As for Bitcoin futures – now dominated by the all-conquering CME derivatives exchange – the 
            CBOE last November announced it would launch new contracts this Thursday, 11 January 2024. Which seems a happy coincidence. And the CBOE's Bitcoin contracts could do with a fair wind. Because in March 2019 – and with ""money of the future"" buying only 1/4 as many fiat Dollars as it did at the Christmas 2017 top – the CBOE had what CNBC charitably called 
            ""a change of heart"", ending its first foray into BTC futures and letting the last of them expire that June.
           

              
           

             So maybe another history lesson from gold might apply. Because gold ETFs also marked a much-hyped step in that asset's long-term path upwards. And ""when the first gold ETF became available in March 2003, 
            it was a good time to start marketing gold as it had risen steadily from $250 to $350,"" as the category's true pioneer Graham Tuckwell – now chairman of ETFS Capital – noted in 2021, looking back almost 2 decades.
           

              
           

             Anticipation of gold ETFs was, of course, much smaller 2 decades ago than the hope and hype we're seeing around US Bitcoin products today. Back then, ETFs idea were still very new as an idea and unproven for 
            sucking in retail or institutional dollars.
           

              
           

             So while gold set a 7-year high one month before Tuckwell's GOLD ETF launched for Australian investors – and while it then decisively broke above its 20-year ceiling around $400 when the big GLD gold ETF launched in November 2004 for US investors – that rise looked (and still looks) much more about gold's underlying uptrend than about any product-specific mooning.
           

              
           

             Maybe that's where Bitcoin now sits, somewhere on a long-term uptrend that could keep on rising. But the anticipation and anticlimax of BTC ETFs to date suggest that maybe, just maybe, the days of moon-shots and laser eyes and even of 
            sudden 70% plunges or 
            90% crashes are over. Maybe.
           

              
           

             If so, that wouldn't mean BTC can't badly hurt your portfolio anymore. Physical bullion, after all, lost 25% inside 3 months in 
            the 2013 gold price crash fuelled by (you guessed it) a rush for the exits by gold ETF shareholders. But it might mean that a slower, less volatile and moon-free Bitcoin does at last become more widely acknowledged as an investable asset.
           

              
           

             Beyond that, 
            Bitcoin still isn't money today. Indeed, the long-awaited arrival of US ETFs looks like the final nail in that coffin. And 
            nor is Bitcoin gold. Getting SEC approval for ETF investment funds doesn't change any of that."

Article:Each new American needs 3 million pounds of resources...

 The UNITED STATES is adding new renewable energy capacity at a record clip, but that doesn't mean it's ready to quit fossil fuels just yet, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 The country just became the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the first time ever, with last year's shipments hitting an unprecedented 91.2 million metric tonnes, exceeding top suppliers Australia and Qatar.
 The surge in LNG exports, primarily driven by Freeport LNG's return to full service and robust global demand, particularly from Europe, signifies America's pivotal role in the global energy market.
 The US also remains the world's largest oil producer. In October, the energy powerhouse generated a staggering 13.25 million barrels per day, marking only the fourth month on record that the country met or surpassed 13 million barrels per day on average.
 It's against this backdrop that we share with you our always-popular, interactive Periodic Table of Commodities Returns, updated to reflect 2023 data.
 
 Commodities as a whole had a challenging year, with the group finishing down 12.55% due to a number of factors, including rising rates, recession fears and China's disappointing pandemic reopening.
 Excess supply contributed to the drawdown. Despite strong global demand, the price of natural gas plunged nearly 44%, its worst year in at least a decade, largely as a result of record-high production. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the US produced an astonishing 104.9 billion cubic feet per (Bcf/d), a new monthly high.
 After topping the list of commodities in the previous two years, lithium prices cratered for very much the same reason in 2023. This, combined with news that Americans' appetite for electric vehicles (EVs) may be waning, drove the battery metal down to prices last seen in summer 2021.
 I believe these lower prices set up an attractive buying opportunity. Commodities are the building blocks of everything we use and enjoy on a daily basis, and as the global population expands, so too does demand for these materials.
 The Minerals Education Coalition (MEC) estimates that every American born in 2023 will require over 3 million pounds of metals, minerals and fuels over the course of their lifetime. Last year alone, over 40,000 pounds of raw materials, from cement to sand to aluminum, were needed for every person in the US.
 Gold was the number one commodity and only one of two that finished the year in the black, copper being the other commodity (just barely). The precious metal rose 13.10% to close the year above $2,000 per ounce for the very first time, and with an average 2023 price of $1,943, it managed to notch its eighth straight annual gain. Gold has now advanced in 20 of the past 24 years, or 83% of the time.
 
 Looking ahead to the end of 2024, I believe we'll see a fresh boost in gold's investment case once the Federal Reserve begins trimming rates.
 Support should also come from central banks, which bought a record amount of gold in the first nine months of the year. Financial institutions purchased a net 800 metric tonnes from January to September 2023, a 14% increase from the same period in 2022, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).
 China easily led all other countries, accumulating 181 tonnes of gold in the first nine months, as it seeks to prop up its currency and diversify away from the US Dollar. The WGC estimates that gold now represents just 4.3% of the country's total foreign reserves, compared to nearly 70% for the US If China were to get to America's level, it would need to buy an additional 33,810 metric tonnes, which is 10 times more gold than the entire world produced in 2022.
 Before moving on, I'd like to point out that US national debt just crossed above $34 trillion for the first time, the equivalent of $101,000 per US citizen, or $264,000 per taxpayer. I believe this is a good place to look if you want to know where gold may be headed in the coming months and years.
 Since the start of this century, national debt and gold have shared a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.9. In simple terms, this means that both have tended to make similar moves day-to-day. If you think debt is headed higher, it may make sense to consider an investment in physical gold and gold mining stocks.
 
 On the energy side, the renewable energy market saw significant strides in 2023, with over 440 gigawatts of added capacity. Notably, both the US and Europe set new benchmarks for solar installations, while China's contributions dwarfed everyone else's, adding between 180 and 230 gigawatts (GW).
 Wood Mackenzie, however, forecasts a slowdown in the growth rate of annual solar installations this year. Despite this, the global solar market remains substantially larger than it was a few years ago, following a typical S-curve pattern of rapid growth followed by gradual maturation. This build-out is expected to benefit silver in particular, a key mineral found in photovoltaic (PV) panels.
 On a final note, 2024 is an election year, and it appears more and more likely that we'll have a second rematch between incumbent president Joe Biden and Donald Trump. I expect to see heightened vitriol and animus this year compared to past cycles, given that both men are deeply unpopular and facing either criminal charges or an impeachment inquiry.
 As unpleasant as this election is shaping up to be, I don't predict substantial effects on the market. Believe it or not, the S&P 500 has never declined in a presidential re-election year, and historical data doesn't support the notion that election outcomes profoundly influence US stock market returns over the long term. Other factors are more crucial in driving stock market trends.
 Therefore, I advise that investors concentrate on underlying economic conditions. In an election year, the most effective investment strategy, in my view, is to maintain a diversified portfolio instead of pursuing short-term, tactical bets."
2024-01-08,"Title:2024: Year of the 493?
Article:Magnificent 7 trading 2.5x over average P/E...

 WE REFER to the 493 stocks of the S&P 500 – the 493 stocks not named Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon or Meta, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 Those are the seven wagon-pullers that have hauled the stock market to present extremes. The S&P 500 galloped 24% last year under their behemoth influence.
 The remaining 493 lagged far behind them.
 Michael Lebowitz of Real Investment Advice:
 ""[2023's] most popular investment bandwagon [was] the Magnificent 7, comprised of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta.
 ""These seven stocks gained 71%...while the remaining 493 stocks added a mere 6%. The outperformance pushed up their contribution to the S&P 500 to nearly 30%. Lastly, the sharp increase in stock prices led to even more extreme valuations for the group...
 ""As we enter 2024, be open to the possibility that last year's winners will not take the crown this year.""
 We are indeed open to that alarming possibility.
 A low P/E ratio indicates stocks are cheap. A high P/E ratio indicates stocks are dear.
 The lower the valuation...the higher returns investors can expect across the next several years.
 The opposite likewise holds true. Elevated valuations imply diminished returns across the next several years.
 A P/E ratio of 17 is about par...as history runs.
 That is, P/E ratios below 17 indicate stocks are cheap. Above 17 stocks are expensive.
 What is today's P/E ratio for these Gargantuas?
 S&P Global informs us that the current ratio for these stocks registers a galactic 42.8. – some 2.5 times par.
 Investors in these stocks are offering to shovel up $42.80 for each $1 of earnings. Handsome!
 If the term ""mean reversion"" has anything in it – and we believe it does – these investors are in for a good whaling.
 The technology sector's overall P/E ratio presently flies along at 33. If their ratios remain unchanged, S&P Global informs us these stocks may leap 25.2% this year.
 Yet what if these ratios revert to their 2022-23 average? These stocks may merely yield 8.2%.
 And if their P/E ratios retreat to their 2017-19 averages? These market makers may yield -18.6%. That is, negative 18.6%.
 Thus the market pushers would become the market pullers. The stock market's colossal assets would become its colossal liabilities. And the hordes that flocked into them would as rapidly flock out of them.
 Would the remaining 493 stocks of the 500 assume the locomotive's controls...and power the freight train on?
 It is possible. Yet which ones? If they now must be pulled...how could they push?
 Let us consider the S&P 500 in the aggregate. Its combined P/E ratio presently reads 24.6.
 That ratio tracks far beneath the Magnificent Seven's 42.8 and the technology sector's 33 average.
 Yet recall: 17 is par. Thus the S&P 500 is overvalued by this metric. Not fantastically overvalued. Yet it represents no bargain at the going price.
 Recall, elevated valuations today indicate depressed stock prices tomorrow. Mark Hulbert of the eponymous Hulbert Financial Digest:
 ""If the stock market is to break out to record highs, as some exuberant bulls are predicting, then it will have to look elsewhere than valuations for support. That's because the S&P 500 now is almost as overvalued today as it was at the bull market's January 2022 high, despite last year's bear market. This is both unusual and disappointing, since the typical pattern is for a bear market to largely work off the previous bull market's excesses – thereby creating the preconditions for a major new bull leg.""
 Shall we now turn to Mr.Warren Buffett and his famous indicator? What would Omaha's sage say?
 The Buffett Indicator is simply the ratio of total United States stock market capitalization to the gross domestic product.
 A reading below 1 indicates a stock market undervalued against the economy underlying it. Stocks are steals. The stock market and economy are marching precisely in step, the one the perfect mirror of the other .
 A reading above 1 indicates a stock market overvalued against the economy underlying it. Stocks are dear.
 This gauge read 2.1 prior to the 2000-01 collapse with its horrific overvaluations in the technology sector. That is, total stock market capitalization registered 2.1 times GDP.
 The Buffett Indicator attained a delirious 2.6 in late 2021 – a record. What does it presently read?
 The answer is 1.72.
 The gross domestic product hovers at $27.6 trillion. Total stock market capitalization, meantime, runs to $47.49 trillion.
 That is, the stock market is ""significantly overvalued"" relative to the gross domestic product.
 A 1.72 ratio does not represent a 2.1 or 2.6 lunatic derangement, it is true.
 It nonetheless represents an overvalued stock market – in Buffett's telling at least.
 Of course this Buffett Indicator is no crystal sphere. It reveals neither day nor hour of reckoning. It merely takes the overall view. And the overall view is overvaluation – again, in Mr.Buffett's telling.
 What does an overvalued stock market imply for the following decade? Bloomberg:
 ""A monster 10 years for US stocks has showered money on the buy-and-hold faithful and made virtually every other asset class an also-ran.
 ""So great have the gains been that some fairly simple math shows that however roaring the 2020s turn out to be, reprising the last decade's bounty will take near-miracle expansions in earnings and valuations.""
 Will these near-miracle expansions and valuations locate within the 493?
 We do not know. Yet we are far from convinced that they will.
 Of course it is possible – it is possible – that the Magnificent Seven will rampage clear through 2024 and beyond.
 Manias can defy all logic, all sense. And market manias are often the most maniac of all manias.
 Yet we cling to our faith in mean reversion. As we have argued before: Scales balance ultimately, what goes up comes down, what goes down comes up. The mighty fall, mountains crumble, the meek inherit the earth.
 We hazard stock market and economy will meet once again on fair ground. We further hazard they will meet upon the economic level – not the stock market level.
 When? We do not know of course. The answer...as always...is on the knees of the gods.
 Perhaps Mr.Powell and mates can hold the sun up in the sky. Perhaps their tricks can postpone sunset indefinitely.
 And perhaps pigs will sprout wings...and take flight."
2024-01-07,"Title:How Would You Like Your Landing?
Article:Hard or soft, a landing is coming...

 SOFT LANDINGS, it has been said, are the holy grail of monetary policy, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 There may be signs that we're on the cusp of one. But what does it mean for the economy in 2024 to have a soft landing? And conversely, what constitutes a hard landing?
 Simply put, a soft landing occurs when the Federal Reserve manages to curb inflation without triggering a sharp increase in unemployment or pushing GDP growth into negative territory.
 A hard landing, on the other hand, is when interest rates rise and inflation decreases, but at the cost of a recession and high unemployment.
 Achieving a soft landing is exceptionally challenging. Noted MIT economist Rudi Dornbusch (1942-2002) famously quipped: ""None of the post-war expansions died of old age. They were all murdered by the Fed.""
 Indeed, out of nine tightening cycles over the past five decades, the bank successfully engineered a soft landing only twice. The other seven instances culminated in recessions.
 
 Princeton economics professor Alan Blinder offers some hope.
 If the need to combat inflation is not too extreme, he writes in a recent article, the Fed has demonstrated its ability to orchestrate an economic landing that either avoids a recession or induces a relatively mild one. The central bank's reputation for causing hard landings ""derives mainly from conquering the 1970s inflation – which took three landings,"" Blinder says.
 The key to predicting the outcome in 2024 lies in economic indicators, especially as experts project the consumer price index (CPI) in the US to decline to 2.7% while the Fed's target rate is expected to reach 4.50% by the end of the year.
 Despite the occasional gloomy predictions and forecasts, investors should be cautious about buying into the ""America-is-in-decline"" narrative, Merrill points out in its weekly Capital Market Outlook.
 America's share of global gross domestic product (GDP), estimated at 26% for 2023, has increased from 24.8% at the start of the decade. Over the past four years, the US economy has added an additional $6 trillion to its economic base, bringing total US output to around $27 trillion. Most impressively, since the beginning of the decade, the S&P 500 has consistently outperformed most developed and emerging markets.
 
 Investors were treated to a promising holiday season, characterized by strong consumption.
 Mastercard reports a year-over-year increase of +3.1% in US retail sales, excluding automobiles, during the 2023 holiday shopping season from November 1 through December 24. This measure encompasses both in-store and online retail sales across all payment forms and is not adjusted for inflation.
 Finally, the Santa Claus rally appears to be in place. This phenomenon describes a period where the stock market closes higher during the last five trading days of the current year and the first three trading days of the new year.
 ""Where else in the world is there an economy that leads or dominates in so many diverse industries, ranging from agriculture to aerospace, education to entertainment, and technology to transportation, to name just a few sectors?"" asks Joseph Quinlan, head of Merrill's market strategy.
 I couldn't have said it better myself.
 In the context of a potential soft landing, historical trends suggest that gold may not perform as strongly. According to the World Gold Council (WGC), soft landing environments have typically resulted in flat to slightly negative average returns for gold.
 However, every cycle is unique, and 2024 may bring surprises.
 Heightened geopolitical tensions in a key election year for many major economies, combined with continued central bank buying, could provide additional support for gold. Central banks and official institutions have played a pivotal role in boosting gold's performance over the past two years, with the WGC estimating that excess central bank demand added 10% or more to gold's gains in 2023.
 This trend is likely to persist, potentially providing an extra boost to gold prices in 2024.
 
 In the event that a recession becomes a reality, weaker growth could help steer inflation back toward central bank targets, eventually leading to interest rate cuts. Such an environment has been conducive to both gold and high-quality government bonds, making them appealing options for investors, the WGC says.
 As we enter 2024, it's essential for investors to remain vigilant, monitor economic indicators closely and consider the various possibilities that lie ahead. While the prospect of a soft landing offers optimism, the financial landscape remains subject to change. By recognizing the strength of the US in the global economy and staying attuned to market dynamics, investors can position themselves for success in the new year."
2024-01-05,"Title:Year in Review: Magnificent Seven, Gold, Copper and Shipping
Article:Big themes and winners from 2023...

 The U.S. STOCK MARKET ended the year up a respectable 25% or more, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 That's despite a number of significant hurdles, from multiyear-high interest rates to ongoing fighting in Ukraine and the Middle East.
 It's important to point out that these returns are due mainly to the performance of a very small group of tech stocks that people are calling the Magnificent Seven. Composed of Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, the group contributed roughly 60% to the S&P 500's gains in 2023.
 The Magnificent Seven resembles the FAANG stocks, which surged during the pandemic as housebound consumers spent their stimulus checks online. The investment case this time, though, is artificial intelligence, or AI. Nvidia, whose chips are used for AI work, is 2023's best S&P 500 performer, up nearly 240% year-to-date.
 Speaking of unrest in the Middle East, recent Houthi militant attacks on ships in the Red Sea have significantly impacted global shipping routes, notably through the Suez Canal.
 The situation is causing reroutes, spurring longer voyage distances and higher rates, which we believe could be a tailwind for container shipping companies. Late December, the Solactive Global Shipping Index, which launched in December 2015, hit a new all-time high.
 
 The Suez Canal, a critical shipping lane with daily transits of 50 to 60 vessels, is now seeing diversions around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, which add substantial time and distance to voyages.
 The reroute extends North European and North American voyages by as many as 2,500-3,500 nautical miles (NM), and up to 7,000 NM for some Mediterranean destinations, significantly increasing fuel costs. In addition, London's marine insurance market has expanded its high-risk area in the Red Sea, raising shipping insurance premiums.
 The list of carriers that had paused Red Sea transits and/or were rerouting around Africa include industry leaders such as Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd, Evergreen, Cosco and more.
 It's tempting to compare the current situation to the six-day blockage of the Suez Canal by Evergreen's Ever Given in March 2021. Spot rates weren't immediately affected at the time, rising about 158% within six months, from $4,300 per 40-foot equivalent until (FEU) to over $11,000 FEU.
 Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but a similar delay now could spark higher shipping rates by as soon as the Chinese New Year, which in 2024 falls on February 10.
 Every year around this time, I share with you the five most-read articles I published over the prior 12 months. Revisit the highlights below, starting with number five, a Frank Talk on gold from November.
 #5. Gold Prices' Strongest October In Half A Century Gold prices experienced their strongest October since 1978, rallying 7.3% to close at $1983 an ounce, despite challenges from high Treasury yields and a strong US Dollar. The surge was attributed to various economic and geopolitical risks, including high national debt and ongoing recession concerns.
 Although the metal appeared overbought, strong support was developing, suggesting the potential for further increases. Central banks have significantly increased their gold holdings, with purchases in the third quarter marking the second-largest on record, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Countries such as China, Poland and Turkey led the buying spree, aiming to diversify away from the US Dollar.
 
 Additionally, in Japan, gold prices reached record highs in response to the Yen's decline against the US Dollar and inflation concerns. This global context suggests that gold and gold mining equities might be a prudent investment strategy, especially in times of high inflation.
 #4. The 10 Most Popular Luxury Brands Online In April 2023, LVMH became the first European company ever to surpass $500 billion in market value, while its CEO, Bernard Arnault, briefly became the world's wealthiest person.
 Shares of LVMH were up around 35% for the year on hopes that China's long-awaited lifting of pandemic restrictions would be a tailwind for luxury stocks. In the end, China proved itself a dud as its economy slowed along with consumption and investment.
 Looking ahead, we remain very bullish on the luxury market. As people in emerging countries join the global middle class, luxury's customer base is expected to surge to 500 million people by 2030, up from 400 million in 2022, according to Bain & Company. India alone could mint between 35 and 40 million new middle- to high-income consumers, which would expand the size of its luxury market 3.5 times compared to today.
 In this post from June, I shared with you the top 10 most popular luxury brands online, as ranked by Luxe Digital. Topping the list was Christian Dior, a key member of LVMH's colossal luxury empire.
 #3. Copper Market Poised For Unprecedented Growth In June, Citi's managing director for commodities research, Max Layton, advised investing in copper.
 The red metal's price at the time, $8,300 a ton, was substantially below its 2021 peak, and Layton predicted a potential rise to $15,000 a ton by 2025, a jump that would ""make oil's 2008 bull run look like child's play.""
 Copper may need to jump to at least $15,000 to spur more companies to build new, critically needed mines, says billionaire Robert Friedland, founder of Ivanhoe Mines. That would be an increase of over 75% from today's prices.
 This bullish outlook is based on an expected supply-demand imbalance, with electric vehicles (EVs) requiring significantly more copper than traditional vehicles. EV sales are projected to reach 27 million by 2026, indicating a promising and potentially profitable future for the copper market.
 #2. Top 10 Gold Mining Stocks by Free Cash Flow Yield In this post, I emphasized the importance of free cash flow (FCF) yield as a key metric for evaluating the financial health and operational efficiency of gold and precious metal mining companies.
 Free cash flow represents the cash remaining after a company has covered its operating expenses and capital expenditures, offering a more reliable measure of profitability than earnings or net income, as it's less prone to manipulation.
 The rankings suggest these companies –which include Impala Platinum Holdings, Dundee Precious Metals and Silver Lake Resources – are not only financially robust but also efficient in their operations, with the potential to pay dividends, buy back stock, reduce debt and invest in future growth.
 #1. PetroDollar Dusk, PetroYuan Dawn The world may be shifting away from the 'petro-dollar'.
 In place since the 1970s, this system bolsters the US Dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, but recent developments indicate a possible move away from the greenback, with countries like China and Russia considering or already settling trades in other currencies, notably the Chinese Yuan.
 Russia, China and other developing economies are diversifying their reserves by increasing their gold holdings, a move that could have long-term implications for investors. Among these include potential currency risks, commodity price volatility and an increased attractiveness of gold."
2024-01-04,"Title:You'll Never Know More Than Goldman
Article:So stop trying to beat Wall Street's insiders...

 WHEN I was a kid, I could never hit a curveball, writes Greg Guenther in The Daily Reckoning.
 The timing on my swing was always off.
 And when I grew up and became an investor, I ran into the same issue...my timing was always off.
 Either I'd buy too early or sell too late – missing out on more profits than I'd care to even think about.
 Once the Great Financial Crisis hit, I knew I had to switch up my strategy.
 As soon as the market starts to control you...you've lost. You'll miss the curveball every time.
 I had to stop thinking like an investor, and start thinking like a trader. Because trading isn't about timeframes, it's about mindset.
 When you think of traders, what might come to mind is someone perpetually shackled to their computer, chugging coffee and stressing over every minuscule move in the market.
 But the most successful traders aren't the day traders, it's the traders that only trade what's right in front of their face.
 I don't consider myself a bull, or a bear, I simply take advantage of opportunity when it presents itself. And that could be a long bullish bet, or a short, in-and-out bearish put.
 I ""quit"" investing to trade because I enjoy keeping my own schedule, spending time with my family, and (mostly) ignoring the market pundits who are only blathering about stocks to sell ad space for prescription drugs and car insurance.
 It's just easier to trade when you tune it all out.
 Thinking like a trader will not only dramatically improve your returns, it will also free you from the never-ending spin-cycle of the financial media, bogus Wall Street analysis, and foggy economic prognostications that never seem to come true.
 If you're going to invest in a company, you want to know what it does, who its customers are, how much money it makes, various valuation metrics, plans for future growth, etc.
 These are all supposed to be important pieces of information. And information is what most investors crave. Many diligent market watchers – especially newer investors – love to dig into news articles, analyst ratings, and earnings statements.
 They want to feel informed. After all, the more you know, the better chance you have at picking a winner.
 Except this isn't entirely true.
 Over the long haul, a company will live or die based on its ability to make money and grow. I'm not disputing these facts.
 But you probably won't profit from these long-term success stories based on widely-available fundamental research or economic trends.
 In the world of ""investing"" you have to compete with sophisticated professional investors who can exploit limitless resources to deliver returns to their clients.
 You will never be able to discover information about a company that Goldman Sachs doesn't already know.
 The connections analysts can exploit and the sheer amount of information they can obtain that a Main Street investor could never sniff is obvious. Plus, the major Wall Street institutions have access to billions of Dollars (of course!), armies of quantitative analysts, mathematicians, and virtually unlimited computing power.
 Stop pretending you can beat these monsters after spending a couple hours Googling stocks. You and I don't have an edge over these firms. There's no information we could legally obtain that would tell us something about a specific company someone in a major financial institution's research department doesn't already have on file.
 Instead, think like a trader.
 And to start thinking – and making money – like a trader, you have to recognize that the market moves in distinct, almost predictable patterns.
 Prices ebb and flow based on the fundamental forces of supply and demand. Those fundamentals are driven by a whole range of factors, including investor psychology.
 Charts are a powerful way to reveal what investors are thinking – as well as indicate what their next moves will be.
 The trick is figuring out how all of those pieces fit together, and know how and when to act.
 Which is why I developed a system I want to share with you: my system for pinpointing the perfect buying and selling time...and which stocks to pull the trigger on.
 I look for several different kinds of signals, the most important one is what I call the Cash Line.
 Without getting too deep into the details, it's a reliable way to tell when a stock's price is set to dramatically change direction.
 It's essentially the point where greed and the fear of missing out kicks in – when investors watching from the sidelines decide the stock is worth buying.
 They'll suddenly start placing buy orders – sending the stock's price even higher."
2024-01-03,"Title:Happy New Goldilocks
Article:But remember, she did get caught by the 3 bears...

 The MACRO MARKET backdrop is not likely to go the way trend following market watchers currently anticipate, reckons Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 In fact, with patience it could turn out to be like shooting contrary fish in a barrel.
 The stock market rally – which NFTRH had anticipated a year ago on a larger basis and since October of this year for its next leg on a more compact time frame – is doing a wonderful job of holding to its seasonal pattern. The rally is sucking in the holdout FOMOs who, one by one, are falling for the duel pleasantries of a softening Fed and by extension, a Goldilocks-like ""soft landing"" scenario for the economy.
 Okay fine, dear come-lately bullish soft-landers. But please consider that the author you are reading at this very moment called Goldilocks nearly a year ago, at the dawn of 2023. And Goldilocks was eventually caught by the 3 bears, remember.
 ""This would be a whiff of the ole' Goldilocks regime. A whiff, mind you. I don't think we are going to see the likes of the 2013-2018 experience. She'll eventually get nabbed with a bowl of 'just right' porridge in her hands.""
 With a year's worth of positive reinforcement (of their trend following natures) today's economists are 76% percent in the belief that the chances of a recession are less than 50% and BoA is predicting a ""soft landing"" rather than a recession. BoA, in line with Jim Cramer and a growing group of shiny happy economic people.
 I was also in time for the declining Treasury yields aspect of the Goldilocks play. Like, calling the top in the 30-year yield exactly to the day (dumb luck, but technically educated). Again, any perma-bear can rail on about the contrarian bearish play developing. But it means more when it comes from someone who was prepared (and prepared NFTRH subscribers) for the bull a year ago, and interpreted that an initial response to declining yields would be in the Goldilocks/sentiment relief vein.
 
 Am I touting my accomplishments of the last year? Sure. I admit that freely. I am also someone who fesses up to my bad calls.
 Credibility is important because amid the noise of social media, the mainstream financial media and even the smaller niche media, few remember who may actually have proof behind their words and who may be simply jumping the train in 'me too!' fashion.
 So I think we understand each other. NFTRH got the 2023 rally right. What's more, all this ""soft landing"" crap was part of the plan.
 As the stock market rises, analysts and commentators find the need to re-tool their outlooks lest they no longer be analysts and commentators. Many are, after all, selling their ability to harvest your eyeballs (not to mention your heart and mind) more than their ability to provide timely and accurate guidance about the markets.
 That necessary preamble out of the way, let's move on to the 2024 market view. One of the most important guides we use has been the Semiconductor (SOX) > Tech (NDX) > Broad (SPX) leadership chain.
 In ratio to each other, Semi is still leading Tech, which is still leading SPX. Nominally, SOX and NDX (and the DJIA) have all recently dinged ""NEW ALL-TIME HIGHS!!!"" Cue the media touts when SPX joins the party and the last of the FOMOs cannot take it anymore and jump in.
 Consider that this is happening during the holiday seasonal, set up to bull on cue in October due to moderately over-bearish dumb money sentiment that is now extremely over-bullish as per Sentimentrader.com.
 You know that a contrary play is worth its salt when it forces someone who anticipated it as just a play to consider whether it might actually be what the majority think it is. Markets always push the limits and I have lately considered elements that could drive a bullish market out to spring time (the anticipated timing of the Fed's first rate cut, which is when the market traditionally tanks). But with all the rules the market has broken since 2020 it is under no obligation to wait that long before it cracks.
 Our favored view continues to be that it will not wait that long. The seasonal extends into February and sentiment is blazing hot. Markets often blow out to the upside after a FOMO-driven melt up. Witness the Nasdaq in 2000 and silver in 2011, as two examples.
 As a disclaimer so that we understand each other, I am not short one single thing right now. I am long several sectors that make sense for the times. That includes the gold stock sector, especially, although my expectation is that the bull market in the miners may be rudely interrupted as well in the coming months.
 On a related matter, the monetary metal that the miners dig out of the ground is hanging around, while silver (for which we have a nice interim upside operating target) decides whether or not to take short-term leadership. On a related note, when it does come time for asset markets to crack, silver (more cyclical, more inflation sensitive) will very likely nose dive in relation to gold (with more monetary, liquidity and value characteristics).
 While the gold price is generally flat lining vs. major stock indexes, although not vs. some broader stock market measures, it is logically out-performing commodities during a disinflationary 2023, and is likely to continue doing so into 2024 as the year starts off amid the Goldilocks/disinflation/""soft landing"" happiness that is less friendly to cyclical, inflation sensitive assets like commodities.
 We have been anticipating a seasonal bounce in many commodity/resources related equities, however, and that view appears to be on track (have a look at Canada's TSX-V and its speculative resource stocks, for which we have an upside target that the index is currently steaming toward).
 Nominally, gold simply lurks at all-time highs and awaits the rest of the macro to sort itself out. For an asset that is usually trumpeted far and wide in perma-bullish fashion, it sure does seem like it is doing so in relatively quiet fashion as even many of its most ardent supporters are either jumping the Bitcoin train or have been trained to expect the worst for the Anti-Bubble, AKA gold.
 Gold is a mirror reflection of the speculative assets that it is a counterweight to. It's relative performance will be dictated by risk in 'risk on' markets, when that risk is realized.
 As a final note, as economic soft-landers extrapolate today's holiday cheer well into, if not through 2025, then the 10yr-2yr yield curve is still inverted, and Goldilocks lives during a curve flattening and inversion. It's the coming de-inversion and steepener that brings the changes; unpleasant ones, either deflationary, inflationary or a combination of both.
 There are different options and time frames for 2024's market, but it is not likely to be friendly to those ""experts"" polled in the CNBC article linked above now trend-following to the ""soft landing"" economic view. That is and has been a necessary component of our view that will ultimately turn bearish for stocks after a perhaps spectacular upside stock market blow off at most, or a roll over sometime after SPX joins the ""ALL-TIME HIGHS!!!"" brigade, at least."
2024-01-02,"Title:Gold Investing Sinks to Bear-Market Lows as Price Hits New Highs
Article:Central banks, in contrast, invest in gold at 6-decade record...


              
           


2024 BEGINS with record-high gold prices meeting the weakest level of private investing since the precious metal's deep bear market of a decade ago, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault, while silver sentiment just fell to the lowest on record.
           

              
           

             More on silver below. But for gold, the split between private investment and central banks couldn't be starker. Because while official-sector reserve managers are 
            buying gold like it's the lynchpin of the global monetary system once more, private capital is selling or shunning the chance to invest in the precious metal as though it's stuck in a bear market even as it makes a record bull run.
           

              
           




              
           

             Spiking to a new spot market record of $2143 per Troy ounce at the start of December, 
            the price of gold ended 2023 with a new year-end, quarter-end, month-end and weekend record high in terms of the US currency.
           

              
           

             Gold bullion rose 13.7% from the previous New Year's Eve to finish at $2062 per Troy ounce after the Federal Reserve confirmed that it plans to cut Dollar interest rates this year.
           

              
           

             In response, fewer private individuals chose to buy gold in December than any month since May 2019, down 12.0% from November's count. The number of sellers in contrast rose 3.5% to the most since October's 7-month high.
           

              
           

             Together, that pushed down the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of private investing activity in physical bullion – by half a point to 51.4, the 
            lowest December reading since 2014, when 
            gold prices extended the previous year's steep crash following the precious metal's then-record peaks of the global financial crisis.
           

              
           

             Last month's reading also capped the annual average of the 
            Gold Investor Index at the lowest in 9 years, down 1.6 points from 2022 at 53.0. The index would read 50.0 if the number of buyers exactly matched the number of sellers across the month. Its monthly reading hit a decade peak of 65.9 as 
            the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020.
           

              
           

             High interest rates and record-high gold prices are deterring new buyers from choosing to invest in gold while also inviting continued profit-taking among existing investors. In contrast, central banks led by China continue buying gold regardless of price, hoarding at the fastest pace since the early 1960s as they seek to de-dollarize their foreign reserves to spread risk and reduce the risk of exposure to US sanctions.
           

              
           

             That highlights the 
            worsening mistrust and tension between major powers ahead of 2024's US election. Yet despite last year's dreadful geopolitical news, gold lacked urgency for private investors as global stock markets almost reversed 2022's crash.
           

              
           

             With gold's uptrend forecast to continue in 2024, private-sector gold bullion demand is likely to rally as the US Fed leads Europe in starting to cut interest rates. But a more marked rebound will probably need fresh urgency from a geopolitics, economic or financial shock.
           

              
           

             By weight, gold's record-high finish to 2023 saw BullionVault users sell more of the 'safe haven' precious metal than they bought as a group for the 4th month running, shrinking their total holdings – securely vaulted and insured in each client's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich – below 47 tonnes for the first time since March 2022.
           

              
           

             But while BullionVault user holdings are now 2.6% lighter than August 2023's record and 1.2 tonnes smaller than at New Year 2023 – a record-heavy annual outflow – they rose in value by 11.0% in Dollar terms across last year to reach a new record at end-December above $3.1 billion (+5.1% in Sterling to £2.4bn, +7.0% in Euros to €2.8bn, +19.2% in Japanese Yen to ¥441bn).
           

              
           




              
           

             Silver's month-average price rose in December, up 2.5% in Dollar terms to reach $24 for the first time since July.
           

              
           

             But the precious metal fell sharply into month-end, losing 4.9% in Dollar terms from the end of November's finish at $25, the highest since mid-2021. That saw the number of silver buyers rebound across December by 43.6% from November's 13-year low, while the number of sellers sank by 41.3% from what was a 7-month high.
           

              
           

             Together that pulled the Silver Investor Index up 4.4 points from November's new series low to read 50.8 last month. It also held the index's annual average at 50.8 as well, down 1.7 points from 2022's annual average at a record-low on our 12-year series.
           

              
           

             Again, high interest rates on cash make un-yielding bullion less attractive. But outflows from silver bullion are heavier and steadier than from gold, and the excitement of January 2021 – when 
            the #silversqueeze meme took hold and very briefly spiked the price to $30 per ounce – now feels a very long time ago for the productively useful precious metal.
           

              
           

             By weight, investors were net liquidators of silver for the 7th month of 2023 in December, selling 14 tonnes more than they bought as a group on BullionVault and shrinking their total holdings to 1,214 tonnes.
           

              
           

             The smallest silver holding in 31 months and 4.2% below October 2022's record level, it entered New Year worth $928 million (£728m, €838m, ¥131bn), down 3.6% in Dollar value from 12 months before.
           

              
           

             Most usually, and whether in bull or bear markets, silver prices tend to track gold but extend its moves. Last year in contrast, gloomy economic forecasts over-rode 
            new record-heavy industrial demand for silver, denting speculation even as its uses grew yet again, led by solar energy technologies. More crucially amid this lull in demand to invest, silver also continues to lack that central-bank demand now doing so much to support and boost gold investing prices as 2024 begins."
2024-01-01,"Title:Jerome 1, Windmill 0
Article:Inflation now a past-tense thing for the Fed...

 The FED CHIEF is now talking about inflation in the past tense, says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 ""This inflation WAS not the classic demand overload, pot-boiling over kind of inflation that we think about. It WAS a combination of very strong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but also on the labor side, because we had a [labor force] participation shock,""
 Demand created by pent up pandemic lockdown refugees finally released into the Consumer-sphere with their newly printed (inflated) Dollars in hand. Regardless, the Quixote-like Fed has finally stopped tilting at the inflationary windmill.
 Jerome Powell is speaking as if a conquering hero. Jerome 1, Windmill 0.
 One year ago NFTRH was forecasting this moment with a view of a disinflationary Goldilocks rally environment to be led by Tech, born out of a combination of the mid-term election cycle, wildly over-bearish sentiment at the time and of course, Fed relief due to disinflation.
 We. Are. There.
 But now it is up to animal spirits to finish painting this compelling picture of a bearish market signal juxtaposed against a euphoric bullish stock market. Said spirits would theoretically drive SPX to its double top (already there) with an expected throw over to new all-time highs for good measure.
 
 This is all according to the primary plan NFTRH has been working to since Q4, 2022.
 The play has gone on much longer than originally anticipated (I had it as a Q1, 2023 rally and then into Q2), but here we are a year later with full bull engaging and looking for a new high. So be it. We don't make predictions. We make projections and adjustments along the way. But the primary view was right and today it is still right.
 That view was and still is for growing optimism amid the fade of the evil known as inflation.
 Speaking of optimism, the market had what I've termed a ""bull killer"" reading last summer. Then came a correction and now comes bull killer #2.
 How can the bull be killed twice? Work with me here.
 It's a sentiment extreme, not a timer. It is a condition to a coming top. Moreover, note the wonderful symmetry of the green and red arrows. There was an original bull birther before the market actually bottomed in Q4, 2022 and today there is another killer before the market actually tops, likely in 2024.
 Meanwhile, gold, silver and the miners are expected to be star players in this rally, despite the Goldilocks backdrop, because the rally is coming amid a pivot period from hawkish to dovish by our monetary-regulating overlords as Jerome Hawkeye Powell publicly flips, with words about inflation in the past tense.
 But there is a part 2 to this story and it will play out in 2024, either sooner or later, to the implication of the bond signal/SPX chart above. A bearish implication. But for today, it is the holiday season, the anti-market (USD) is dropping like a stone with the withdrawal of hawkish policy...
 
 And well, Wayne? Garth?
 Frankly, after a moderately successful but grinding year I am going to fully enjoy coming market events. Both as a casino patron now and as a dead eyed market manager later, as risk climbs, herds assemble and cement their perceptions, and the whole noisy cacophony careens toward climax.
 Later in 2024 there will be an opportunity to trade bearish with conviction and to hold precious metals with conviction as well. It's a post-bubble thing...
 ...the ""bubble"" being not stock markets but rather the 20+ year uninterrupted run of monetary policy bubble making that has fed what many call a stock market bubble."
2023-12-30,"Title:Trade Tariffs from the Corn Laws to Imperial Preference
Article:Some political battles never end...

 IN 1846 Richard Cobden's long campaign bore fruit with Britain's repeal of the Corn Laws, the tariffs which kept cheaper foreign wheat out of the country, writes John Phelan, an economist at the Center of the American Experiment, in this article first published at EconLib and reposted at the Cobden Centre.
 The less well-off benefited most and 'free trade' became a touchstone of British politics as the country reached the pinnacle of its power.
 By the end of the 19th century, however, Britain faced increased economic competition from Germany and the United States. A group of concerned 'Imperialists' sought to consolidate the British Empire and one method they advocated was tariffs. Robert Blake explained:
 ""The core of the argument was that political unity could only be achieved if economic unity came first. Just as a zollverein, or customs union, had preceded the political union of the numerous kingdoms into which Germany had been divided fifty years earlier, so a great tariff union embracing the whole of Britain's possessions overseas would be the surest way of preserving the political unity of the British Empire.""
 In practice, this meant 'Imperial Preference', a general duty on imports with a remission for those from the Empire.
 In 1902, Lord Salisbury's Conservatives imposed a duty on imported wheat to help fund the Boer War. When the war ended later that year, Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, a leading Imperialist, recommended the duty be retained but not on imperial imports, as a first step toward Imperial Preference.
 Opposition from the cabinet's Free Traders scuppered the plan; a young Conservative MP, Winston Churchill, 'crossed the floor' to sit as a Liberal. Chamberlain – always a maverick – resigned from the cabinet to campaign for tariffs.
 While tariffs split the Conservatives they united the fractious Liberals who, in 1906, were elected in a landslide. This – followed by a string of escalating political crises; the People's Budget, Home Rule for Ireland, and the First World War – sidelined the tariff issue.
 But no political idea ever truly dies. When the Conservatives returned to sole power in November 1922 they promised that no tariffs would be introduced without a further election. In May 1923, Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister. He had worked in the iron industry and seen his business's American trade lost to the McKinley tariff of 1890.
 With unemployment at 12%, Baldwin saw protection as the answer. In October, he said ""this unemployment problem is the most crucial problem of our country"" but ""I cannot fight it without weapons...I have come to the conclusion myself that the only way of fighting this subject is by protecting the home market.""
 But ""Baldwin consulted no one, even though there was a wealth of official information available,"" Kenneth Young writes.
 ""Lloyd-Graeme, President of the Board of Trade, knew quite well, wrote [Cabinet Secretary Maurice] Hankey, that the figures were against tariffs helping unemployment; when Nevile Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer, instructed his secretaries to gather figures to support Protection, he 'found that they all told the wrong way!'""
 The economist John Maynard Keynes condemned the policy as the ""protectionist fallacy in its grossest and crudest form."" Undeterred, Baldwin called an election for December 6. It was, AJP Taylor wrote, ""the only election in British history, fought solely and specifically on Protection.""
 Whereas Labour and Liberal policy was clear – ""Tariffs are not a remedy for Unemployment,"" Labour said; ""Trade restrictions cannot cure unemployment,"" argued the Liberals – the Conservative's was not. ""The impression left on everyone's mind is of doubt and perplexity,"" Conservative M.P. and Joseph's son Austen Chamberlain wrote, ""We have had six columns of speeches from the P.M. in less than a week and no one knows what he means.""
 The results were calamitous. The Conservatives lost 86 seats and their Commons majority and Labour formed its first government. Protectionism was discredited and tariffs dropped as Conservative policy.
 Again, though, protectionism refused to die. Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Daily Express, and Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, exerted intense pressure on Baldwin. Unemployment rose further after 1929 and when a financial crisis hit in 1931 it brought down the Labour government and returned Baldwin to power if not office with a hefty majority. ""The Government,"" he said, ""must...be free to consider every proposal likely to help, such as tariffs, expansion of exports and contraction of imports...""
 The Conservative dominated coalition not only took Britain off the gold standard but imposed a range of tariffs. Such was the fashion; one-third of parliament's Liberals now supported protection and ""in the spring of 1931 Keynes announced publicly his support for a revenue tariff,"" Barry Eichengreen writes, basing ""his argument on the reduction of unemployment.""
 Richard Cobden's achievement was repudiated. The tariffs enacted by the Conservatives were part of an international movement toward economic autarky which saw trade shrivel in the early 1930s and reaped a bitter political harvest. It would take many years of hard work to undo them."
2023-12-28,"Title:Trump Banned, Civil War Next
Article:Well, war in the courts at least...

 COLLEAGUE Dave Gonigam recently wrote of a potential American ""civil war"", says Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 Is the Supreme Court of the state of Colorado out to kindle one?
 It has ruled – 4-3 – that Donald Trump is disqualified from running upon the Republican ticket in the state of Colorado.
 That is because the state's high court has deemed the fellow guilty of insurrection against the United States.
 They claim the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution – Section Three specifically – as the rock of their case.
 Section Three reads:
 ""No person shall...hold any office, civil or military, under the United States...who, having previously taken an oath...as an officer of the United States...to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.""
 The amendment in question and the section in question are legal artifacts of the United States Civil War.
 Or – as the conflict is officially styled – the ""War of the Rebellion"".
 The section's precise target was former members of the Confederate States of America.
 Now the Supreme Court of the state of Colorado invokes the thing against Trump.
 Courts in Minnesota and Michigan have dismissed comparable challenges to Trump's appearance upon the presidential ballot. Yet Colorado's Supreme Court has pounded a gavel the other way. Ruled the court:
 ""A majority of the court holds that President Trump is disqualified from holding the office of president under Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
 ""Because he is disqualified, it would be a wrongful act under the Election Code for the Colorado Secretary of State to list him as a candidate on the presidential primary ballot...
 ""President Trump incited and encouraged the use of violence and lawless action to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power [on Jan.6, 2021].""
 Concludes the court – sternly, soberly, solemnly, self-aggrandizingly – slump-shouldered under the impossible burden of responsibility it has taken upon itself:
 ""We do not reach these conclusions lightly. We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.""
 Just so. Yet we have consulted our constitutional scholar. We solicited his sage counsel on this ruling. This fellow conveyed to us his grave misgivings over its constitutional fidelity.
 He finds it dynamited through with holes. For example:
 He informs us that the Supreme Court of Colorado – or any other American state – lacks legal standing to rule Trump guilty of ""insurrection"".
 Trump has not been charged – officially – with insurrection against the government of the United States.
 He has not been tried for insurrection against the government of the United States.
 He has not been convicted of insurrection against the government of the United States.
 Trump has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. He has been charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.
 He has been charged with ""conspiracy against rights"", which – in our reckoning – occurs each instance Congress assembles on alleged behalf of the American people.
 Yet Trump has not been charged formally with insurrection. And he has not been ruled guilty of insurrection.
 On what constitutional authority then does the Supreme Court of the state of Colorado find the fellow guilty of insurrection?
 Our constitutional scholar informs us this authority does not exist.
 Yet as the iconoclast Mencken styled it:
 ""A judge is a law student who marks his own examination papers.""
 Trump pledges to file grievance with the Supreme Court of the United States. There he will confront nine additional law students who likewise mark their own examination papers.
 Our constitutional professional believes these exorbitantly privileged law students will rule with plaintiff Trump – and perhaps by a vote of 9-0.
 Is our man's constitutional judgment sound? We are not in a position to ""judge"". That is because we are not a constitutional authority. The abstruse and intricate labyrinths of constitutional law are beyond our slender abilities to navigate. The ""penumbras and emanations"" glowing from the constitutional text are invisible to us. Thus we are disqualified from service upon the Supreme Court of the United States.
 We merely present the findings of our inquiry, in the highest faith.
 We mention...in passing only...that each jurist of the Colorado Supreme Court is a registered Democrat.
 The four who heaved the 14th Amendment, Section Three at Trump attended ""elite"" legal schools. The three who did not heave the 14th Amendment, Section Three at Trump attended the University of Denver's legal school.
 In dissent, one of the three jurists – a certain Carlos Samour – gave the majority a good hard razzing:
 ""The decision to bar former President Donald J.Trump...from Colorado's presidential primary ballot flies in the face of the due process doctrine...
 ""Significantly, there is a federal statute that specifically criminalizes insurrection and requires that anyone convicted of engaging in such conduct be fined or imprisoned and be disqualified from holding public office. See 18 USC. § 2383. If any federal legislation arguably enables the enforcement of Section Three, it's section 2383.""
 This fellow continues, in dissent:
 ""Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment specifically gives Congress absolute power to enact legislation to enforce Section Three. My colleagues in the majority...conclude...that the states are free to apply their own procedures...to enforce it. That is hard for me to swallow.
 ""That...will inevitably lead to the disqualification of President Trump from the presidential primary ballot in less than all 50 states, thereby risking chaos in our country. This can't possibly be the outcome the Framers intended.""
 What are we to conclude about the legal education of the four assenters? Or of the three dissenters?
 Let us consult constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley:
 ""The opinion of the Colorado Supreme Court is so sweeping that it would allow for tit-for-tat removals of candidates from ballots...The opinion is remarkable in how the four justices adopted the most sweeping interpretations to get over each barrier. The result is lack of a limiting principle. I view the opinion as strikingly anti-democratic in what it now allows states to do in blue and red states alike.""
 What if...for example...the red state of Texas opts to retaliate against the blue state of Colorado?
 That is, what if it bars Biden from the Texas ballot?
 Texas might claim the sitting president has executed treasonous crimes for facilitating the mass trespassing of its border with Mexico.
 Conversely – or additionally – it might claim the same president is a corrupt fellow. Thus he is unfit for the office he so villainously and treacherously occupies.
 What if the blue state of California proceeds to retaliate against the red state of Texas for retaliating against the blue state of Colorado?
 And what if the remaining states fall into the chain reaction Colorado has set going?
 In practice it would mean very, very little. Trump would not claim the blue state of California whether he is on the presidential ballot or not. Nor would Biden claim the red state of Mississippi whether he is on the presidential ballot or not.
 Yet what if one or more ""swing states"" ban the one or the other?
 Here you have electoral mayhem. Yet...yet...
 As we type these words we begin to entertain malicious and seditious notions.
 They may very well...by our own admission...cross into actual treason. They run this way:
 Let all 50 states ban one candidate or the other. Let the great circus unfold in all its rings.
 The election – such that it is – would lack all legitimacy.
 Even less legitimacy, that is, than elections currently rate.
 ""But how could we possibly elect a president?"" you thunder.
 Our response: A grinning silence."
2023-12-27,"Title:Gold 'Cheap' at $2050
Article:Yep, and here's why...

 The WORLD has changed radically in recent years, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 We've had the worst pandemic since 1918, and the third worst in world history. We've had a global supply chain breakdown. Inflation has been the worst since the early 1980s, despite the fact that it's come down since peaking last June.
 Aside from the war in Gaza, Europe is experiencing its worst war since the end of World War II.
 The kinetic war in Ukraine has been accompanied by a financial and economic war between the US, the UK, the EU and Russia that involves extreme financial sanctions, including seizing the central bank reserves of the world's 11th-largest economy.
 That financial war and accompanying sanctions disrupted supply chains on top of the disruptions that were already present. They still persist.
 And the world's second-largest economy, China, locked down 50 million people in Shanghai and Beijing for months in a hopeless and misguided effort to suppress Covid. (China has finally seemed to learn that the virus goes where it wants.)
 Meanwhile, tensions in the Taiwan Strait are high, with a lot of talk about a potential Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan. Now attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are driving up insurance rates and diverting oil tankers away from their normal routes, adding weeks to their transit times. That has serious implications for the global economy as oil prices potentially surge. The list goes on.
 If gold is the ultimate safe haven for investors and the world has been dangerously unsafe, then the price of gold must have been skyrocketing, right?
 That's not the case. Today gold is about $2052 per ounce. Gold has experienced a surge lately, but that's still lower than the $2069 all-time high of Aug. 6, 2020.
 The bottom line is gold is lower today than it was three years ago. There have been some spills and thrills along the way including two peaks over $2000 and several smashes down into the $1680 range, but always followed by a reversion to a persistent central tendency that hasn't moved much at all.
 So we're back to the original question. With inflation, shortages and war all around, why is gold not surging past $3000 per ounce and making its way to $4000, $5000 and beyond?
 Supply/demand conditions favor higher gold prices. Global production of gold has remained fairly constant for the past seven years. Over the same seven-year period, during a period when global output was flat, central banks increased their official holdings by over 6%.
 China has added over 1,400 metric tonnes in the past 13 years (that's the official number; unofficially they probably own far more). Russia has acquired over 1,500 metric tonnes over that same period.
 Other large buyers have included Poland, Turkey, Iran, Kazakhstan, Japan, Vietnam and Mexico. Central banks in the Visegrad Group (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) have also bought gold.
 What's curious is that individual investors in the US still seem indifferent to gold as a monetary asset. In theory, central banks are the most knowledgeable about the real condition of the global monetary system. If central banks are buying all the gold they can with hard currency (Dollars or Euros), it's not clear what retail investors are waiting for.
 Of course, central bank holdings are only about 17.5% of total aboveground gold and there is far more demand from bullion investors and for jewelry (a form of wearable wealth). Still, central banks are arguably the most knowledgeable market participants, and their steady increases in gold holdings is meaningful.
 Interest rates also play a supporting role. Many of the directional moves in gold prices over the past three years have been tied to interest rate moves. The correlation is not perfect, but it is strong.
 The rally in gold prices in late 2020 was tied to a fall in interest rates (yield-to-maturity) on the 10-year US Treasury note from 1.930% on Dec. 19, 2019, to 0.508% on July 31, 2020.
 Similarly, the fall in gold prices after February 2021 was tied to an increase in interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note from 1.039% on Jan. 2, 2021, to 3.130% on May 2, 2022. Rates are 3.92% as of today.
 But I believe that interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note will fall again and will continue to fall as global growth weakens. We're already seeing that. Over the past two months, yields have fallen from 4.92% to 3.92%. In bondland, that's a major move.
 That's good news for gold investors. Short-term rates had been going up because of Fed policy, but now the Fed has signaled markets that it's done raising rates. That's a tailwind for gold.
 While market supply/demand conditions are favorable for gold, and the overall interest rate environment is also favorable for gold, neither has seemed to have the power needed to push gold sustainably past $2000.
 What's the problem?
 The real headwind for gold and the main reason gold has struggled to gain traction for the past three years has been the strong Dollar.
 After all, the Dollar price of gold is really just the inverse of the strength of the Dollar. A weaker Dollar means a higher Dollar price for gold. A stronger Dollar means a lower Dollar price for gold.
 It may seem paradoxical to imagine a strong Dollar in the midst of all the inflation we've been seeing. But that's the case.
 What's extraordinary over the past three years isn't that gold hasn't soared; it's that gold has held its own in the face of a persistently strong Dollar. So that leads to the next question:
 What's been behind the strong Dollar and what could cause the Dollar to suddenly weaken and send gold prices into the stratosphere?
 The strong Dollar has been driven by a demand for Dollar-denominated collateral, mostly US Treasury bills, needed as collateral to support leverage on bank balance sheets and in hedge fund derivatives positions.
 That high-quality collateral has been in short supply. As banks scramble for scarce collateral, they need Dollars to pay for the Treasury bills. That fuels Dollar demand.
 The scramble for collateral also speaks to fears of a sequel to the banking crisis in the wake of this year's earlier failures. We're not there yet, but we could be getting close. The crisis is by no means over.
 As weak growth likely turns into a global recession, a new financial panic will be on the horizon. At that point, the Dollar itself may cease to be a safe haven, especially given the aggressive use of sanctions by the US and the desire of major economies including the BRICS nations to avoid the US Dollar system if possible.
 When this panic hits and the Dollar is deemed no longer reliable, the world will turn to gold. That's not an immediate likelihood. This is a process that'll unfold over years. But the trend is going in that direction.
 Investors should consider today's gold prices a gift to acquire gold at bargain prices before markets, and the mainstream media, wake up.
 Even at $2052, gold is so cheap right now, it's practically a steal."
2023-12-22,"Title:2024 Silver Price 'Boosted' by Gold, 'Tempered' by Recession
Article:Gold/silver ratio usually rises in economic and industrial slowdown...


              
           


The PRICE of SILVER is widely forecast to rise again in 2024, but a global economic slowdown could cap its gains even as industrial demand remains close to record highs, pushing up the Gold/Silver Ratio of the 2 formerly monetary metals relative prices.
           

              
           

             ""Gold and silver are forecasted to outshine"" platinum and palladium as well as base metals such as copper and nickel, says the 2024 outlook from US financial-services giant J.P.Morgan, pointing to the US Federal Reserve's cuts to interest rates, plus 
            ""falling US real yields"" as bond prices rally from the last 3 years' drop.
           

              
           

             High interest rates aren't ""favorable for zero-yielding assets such as silver,"" explains specialist consultancy Metals Focus in its 
            final update of this year for the Silver Institute of miners, refiners and dealers. But the silver price in 2024 will also likely face ""poor confidence in industrial commodities due to a slowing Chinese economy.""
           

              
           

             ""Lower interest rates and a subsequently weaker US Dollar should support the silver price,"" agrees analysis for German bullion refiners Heraeus produced by SFA (Oxford). ""However, interest rate cuts usually indicate an ailing economy [and] upside for [the] silver price [will] be tempered by [a] weak industrial outlook.""
           

              
           

             ""The gold:silver ratio is above its long-term average,"" Heraeus' report goes on – suggesting that silver is under-valued – ""but [the ratio] can move higher, as it has done in five of the last six US recessions as gold outperforms silver.""
           

              
           




              
           

             2023 began with one Troy ounce of gold worth 75.7 ounces of silver, a ratio which has since risen to 84.0 as the 'safe haven' yellow metal gained 13.4% in Dollar terms but silver rose only 2.2% from last New Year's Eve.
           

              
           

             Looking at ""silver's recent activity"", says bullion-market expert Rhona O'Connell – now at brokerage StoneX – ""certainly suggests that for now, at least, [the market] is preferring to concentrate on gold rather than responding to the slowing in the US economy, the struggles in Europe and the comparatively anaemic recovery in China [where] 60% of silver’s fabrication demand is driven by industrial uses.""
           

              
           

             Further ahead, O'Connell adds, ""it is important to remember that the outlook for the solar industry in particular is very strong and benefits silver, as does the electrification of the vehicle fleet, underpinning silver’s fundamentals for the longer-term.""
           

              
           

             2023 will have seen 
            industrial demand for silver set a new all-time high, Metals Focus' managing director Philip Newman said earlier this month at the London Bullion Market Association's 
            annual winter seminars.
           

              
           

             J.P.Morgan, whose analysts have ""the 
            highest conviction on a bullish medium-term forecast for both gold and silver over the course of 2024 and into the first half of 2025,"" expects that ""silver prices will likely follow gold"" higher, rising to average ""around $30/oz in the fourth quarter"" of next year. 
           

              
           

             SFA's forecast for silver expects the precious metal to trade in a range of $22 to $29 per Troy ounce. Should 
            the Gold/Silver Ratio hold or rise above this year's average of 83.3 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold, that would price the dearer 'safe haven' metal at more than $2400."
2023-12-22,"Title:The Fed's Critical Transition
Article:No longer raising, set to cut...

 The FED RATE remained unchanged as a result of the FOMC meeting last week. But what's the future look like? asks Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Today, I'll explain what happened in terms of policy moves, what Fed Chair Jay Powell believes will happen next and what will actually happen.
 The difference between Powell's expectations and market expectations creates opportunities for investors to profit from those competing forecasts.
 Whether we see the Dow plummet over the next few months, or a weakening economy with a recession imminent, you've got a front-row seat to research, strategies and recommendations that can help you weather the storm and profit.
 Last week the Fed kept the fed funds rate unchanged. At the same time, they leaned in a more dovish direction with regard to their next policy move, while warning that rate hikes are still on the table in certain circumstances.
 It's important to look at the Fed's reasoning behind its moves and to consider what's next both for the Fed and the US economy.
 Fed Chair Jay Powell's press conference following the announcement is always more informative than the official announcement and this meeting was no exception. Powell's insistence on flexibility going forward is obvious.
 As has been the case since last summer, Powell is caught on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, inflation remains too high.
 On the other hand, if Powell raises rates or simply holds them too high for too long, the inflation could turn to rapid disinflation or even deflation accompanied by a recession.
 Powell understands the dilemma, but he does not know which way to turn. His solution is to do nothing and wait for more data.
 That said, the meeting was highly significant in the sense that the FOMC statement and Powell's remarks were dovish. The Fed turned from a possible rate hike to a possible rate cut as their next move. Nothing was set in stone and no clues were given as to timing, but the tilt toward easing instead of more tightening was unmistakable.
 Of course, Powell tried to have it both ways. He said, ""Inflation has eased from its highs...without a significant increase in unemployment."" In the next breath he said, ""Inflation is still too high."" The way to reconcile these statements is to understand that while inflation may be too high, interest rates may be high enough to combat the inflation without further rate hikes.
 That's the definition of the ""terminal rate"" and that's where Jay Powell believes the Fed is right now.
 Specifically, Powell said rates are, ""likely at or near the peak rate for this cycle,"" and ""the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt."" That's another way of saying we're at the terminal rate.
 As if to hammer the point home, Powell said, a rate hike ""is not the base case anymore as it was 60, 90 days ago.""
 Powell left a few markers that rate hikes might still be needed if the economy does not play out as expected. He said, ""We still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory. That would be premature."" He added that wages are running higher than what would be consistent with the policy goal.
 That's a sign that demand-driven inflation could be on the horizon in place of supply-side inflation, which is waning. To keep his options open, Powell went on to say, ""We will need to see further evidence...that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,"" and, ""We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.""
 One of Powell's more intriguing comments was that the Fed would cut rates before inflation hits the 2.0% target. The idea is that if inflation falls from 3.2% to, say, 2.5%, the Fed might cut rates at that stage.
 The view is that with inflation falling quickly, it could overshoot the 2.0% target and end up at 1.0% or lower. That's a reason to cut rates when inflation is still 2.5% and then watch inflation glide smoothly to the 2.0% target.
 All of this gives the Fed too much credit for finesse. They're not as nimble as this analysis makes them sound. But the remarks do give insight into their thinking, which will help with forecasting in the future.
 Powell also wrestled with an arcane point raised by a reporter. If inflation falls faster than nominal rates, that means real rates are going up. The real rate is simply the nominal rate minus inflation.
 If nominal rates are stuck at 5.5% and inflation drops from 3.2% to 2.5%, then the real rate went up from 2.3% to 3.0%. That's a different form of tightening but one which could cause the Fed to cut rates quickly if inflation falls quickly.
 Powell also reminded reporters that ""We're not talking about altering the pace of QT right now."" QT is quantitative tightening, another form of monetary tightening. So even without interest rate hikes, the Fed is still running a tight money policy.
 Powell took a nod in the direction of a recession when he said, ""Maybe people bought so much stuff that they temporarily don't want any more stuff."" That's a reference to a recent slowdown in consumer spending.
 Markets loved the dovish tilt despite the nuance about real rates and recession. Stock indexes rose about 1.4% to new all-time highs. Gold rallied 2.5% to $2045 per ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged from 4.2% to 3.9%, producing huge capital gains in Treasury notes.
 Even oil futures rose to $74.50 per barrel up from $69.00 earlier in the day. We'll see how long the optimism lasts, especially in the face of recessionary signs. For now, markets want to party like it's 1999.
 On the whole, last week's meeting was important considering that the Fed didn't actually do anything.
 The tilt away from hawkishness toward dovishness was critical. It triggered rallies in stocks, bonds and gold – what some traders call an ""everything rally"".
 The next Fed meeting is Jan. 30-31, 2024. A lot will happen between now and then including more data on inflation, unemployment and economic growth that will affect the Fed's decision-making process.
 I'll be watching all of it carefully and bringing you the latest analysis as events unfold."
2023-12-20,"Title:2024 Forecasts: Gold Price $2342, Silver $29
Article:The wisdom of BullionVault users revealed in latest investor survey...


              
           


IT SEEMS like everyone says the price of gold will continue to rise in 2024, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             Typically that view sees the gold price extending this year's new all-time highs as Western central banks start cutting interest rates, emerging-market central banks continue to buy record quantities of bullion, and geopolitical tensions worsen if not flip into outright conflict between major powers.
           

              
           

             BullionVault users say the same. Only more so.
           

              
           

             Investors responding to our latest survey predict, on average, that the gold price in 12 months' time will trade at $2342 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             Too bullish by half? Maybe.
           

              
           

             But as a crowd, BullionVault users called it pretty darn close this time last year!
           

              
           




              
           

             Back then, gold was trading beneath $1800 per ounce.
           

              
           

             So against today's price of $2025, your forecast of $2012 looks awfully wise.
           

              
           

             It looks even more remarkable when you consider the big challenge which gold prices faced this year.
           

              
           

             You see, the gold price has risen this year even as real interest rates rose at the fastest pace since at least 1950, led by the US Federal Reserve.
           

              
           

             This is remarkable because, as a non-yielding asset, gold typically loses value when interest rates rise, most especially when cash-in-the-bank pays a sharply higher rate of return relative to the pace of inflation.
           

              
           

             On an annual average basis, 2023 saw the US Fed's key interest rate jump by a massive 7 percentage points once you account for inflation. That's steeper even than the real-rate hike of 1981, imposed to kill the prior decade's double-digit inflation at the cost of a deep economic recession.
           

              
           

             That year's jump of 6 percentage points in real US interest rates saw the value of gold bullion plunge by 32% from what remains a modern-era record, the heaviest ever real terms loss on BullionVault's analysis of 100 years of historical data.
           

              
           

             Yet in 2023, in contrast, the real price of gold actually rose, adding more than 3% on an annual average basis.
           

              
           




              
           

             How did gold overpower the kryptonite of steeply higher real rates?
           

              
           

             Supported by household demand for jewelry, small bars and coins, the price of gold most often shows a strong, positive correlation with the level of private-sector investment demand.
           

              
           

             But in 2023, private inflows to gold bullion were crushed by record high nominal gold prices, plus the highest interest rates in two decades.
           

              
           

             Germany's formerly world-leading coin and small-bar demand, for example, has sunk by 80% net of investor selling, while the total size of 
            gold-backed exchange-traded trust funds listed in the UK and Europe has shrunk by nearly 11%, with North American-listed products shrinking almost 5%.
           

              
           

             So who was buying? Central banks.
           

              
           

             As a group, official sector demand more than made up the loss from private-sector investment, with the net increase in central bank purchases weighing nearly twice that drop overall 
            on estimates published by the mining industry's World Gold Council.
           

              
           

             Indeed, BullionVault's analysis says that central-bank demand this year equaled almost 1/3rd of new global mine supply, reaching the highest proportion of new mining output since 1963...
           

              
           

             ...back when gold bullion backed the global monetary system under the post-WW2 Bretton Woods agreement.
           

              
           




              
           

             Private investing, in contrast, fell in 2023 to just 25% of new mine supply.
           

              
           

             That was less than half the level of 
            2020's Covid shock, falling to the lowest proportion since 2013, back when gold prices sank in the precious metal's worst crash since that plunge of the early 1980s.
           

              
           

             Private capital, in other words, has responded to gold's new all-time record high prices like it's actually crashing. Central banks, on the other hand, are buying gold like it has returned as the lynchpin of the global monetary system.
           

              
           

             Central-bank gold demand in 2023 has in fact been even more remarkable when valued as a proportion of global GDP, rising to 0.07% across the last 12 months, just topping 
            the estimated level of 2022 central-bank gold buying at the highest share of economic resources since at least 1960.
           

              
           

             Will this switch from private to government gold buying continue to support and drive prices higher next year?
           

              
           

             Investors responding to BullionVault's latest survey believe so.
           

              
           

             Supply and demand, led by those official-sector purchases, will have the greatest impact on price according to more than 1-in-10 respondents...
           

              
           

             ...the biggest vote for that category in 10 years of our twice-annual survey.
           

              
           

             But leading the replies at 25.0%, albeit down from 33.0% in our mid-2023 poll, is ""Monetary policy""...
           

              
           

             ...meaning those interest-rate cuts everyone is now pencilling in for 2024, including the US Federal Reserve itself.
           

              
           

             Close behind? Polling 22.0% of votes for next year's biggest influence on the gold price comes ""Geopolitics"" such as the Hamas/Israel or Russia/Ukraine war or tensions between the US and China over trade, technology or Taiwan.
           

              
           

             That's up from 17.3% in our mid-2023 survey. And close behind ""Geopolitics"" comes ""Government spending (and the size of government deficits""), polling 20.8%.
           

              
           

             Sum it all up, and ""Politics"" wins hands down as the big driver of precious metals prices in 2024 according to BullionVault users, whether at central banks, the finance ministry or the department of defense (and attack).
           

              
           

             What about ""Inflation""? Polling nearly 1-in-5 votes for the biggest influence this time last year, it has sunk to just 9.0%, retreating as a key factor in the view of active investors in precious metals.
           

              
           

             Silver, by the way, will end next year at $29 per Troy ounce according to the average forecast among the 2,002 users of BullionVault who took a few minutes to review and share their outlook in our latest survey. And that's without the more useful precious metal enjoying any central-bank demand, of course.
           

              
           

             That's the 2024 forecast from actual precious-metal investors, at least. Time will tell as the next 12 months unfold!"
2023-12-20,"Title:2024: Year of the Small Caps
Article:After the big 7 bubbled, Russell 2000 kicks up...

 The MARKET is tipping its hand, reckons Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's The Daily Reckoning.
 If you pay close attention, you'll begin to see the signs of a massive rotation in stocks – a phenomenon most investors will ignore until it's too late.
 If you catch these moves early, you have the chance to pull in impressive returns. As this rotation rally extends, I'm betting one sector could double up the S&P 500 during the first six months of 2024.
 Best of all, you can achieve these market-beating gains with a simple buy-and-hold trade.
 I'll show you how in just a minute, But first, you need to understand what's happening under the surface of the major averages.
 This rotation trade begins with the mega-cap stocks – names like NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (META). The Jim Cramer-dubbed Magnificent Seven ""finished 2022 down 40%,"" reports the Wall Street Journal, ""losing $4.7 trillion in combined market value, whereas the remaining stocks in the S&P 500 dropped 12%.""
 But the Magnificent Seven have once again bubbled back to the top of the market following last year's brutal performance. Now, analysts and pundits are sounding alarms as these mega-caps are once again dominating the market, with Goldman Sachs noting the group has grown to a whopping 30% of the S&P 500.
 For the record, surging mega-caps are not setting off alarm bells for the market at-large. But I don't think they are going to experience the same level of market domination in 2024. No, it's not likely market-leading NVDA is going to rally another 250% next year. It probably won't crash – but I sincerely doubt we'll see a repeat performance of 2023's historic performance.
 Instead of an impending crash due to a top-heavy market, we're seeing the beginning of a rotation away from mega-caps into tech laggards and small-cap stocks – a rotation that has become more pronounced over the past week.
 Last week, the Fed elected to hold rates steady. The market was expecting no action – so that's not what sparked the rally. Instead, the Fed's dovish comments started the feeding frenzy. Powell declared that inflation has eased (finally) and market participants can expect it to be less of a problem in 2024.
 How you personally feel about these comments or the probability of a so-called ""soft landing"" doesn't matter. What's important is how the market interpreted the news, and this is the message stock sent:
 For starters, hikes are likely done. And it's becoming very likely that we'll see some cuts next year, possibly as early as March. More importantly, this Fed meeting was the last real obstacle for the melt-up rally to scale into year-end. I don't see anything else on the calendar standing in our way as 2024 approaches.
 The Nasdaq Composite, S&P and Dow all jumped about 1.4% following the release of the Fed minutes. And the good vibes continued through the end of the week.
 More importantly, small-caps exploded higher as many of the Magnificent Seven stocks failed to keep up. Instead of NVDA hogging the headlines, we watched smaller names and forgotten growth stocks plow higher in dramatic fashion.
 The Russell 2000 rallied a staggering 3.5% on Fed Day. And it didn't stop there.
 By the end of the week, the small-cap index rallied 5.5% to post its fifth green week in a row. This is the same index that was breaking to lows not seen since late 2020 during the final week of October. Seven weeks later, the Russell 2000 is now working on a significant breakout.
 One more important note: The Russell 2000 has grossly underperformed the major averages for nearly two years. While the biggest of the big remained stable presences in the market, the Russell was hit hard by the regional banking crisis earlier this year, and failed to rally with the major averages into the summer months.
 It also experienced a hard reset from August through October that led to a drop of more than 17%. Most mega-caps were stable during this period while smaller names took a beating, acting as a de facto safe haven for investors worried about the potential for a bigger drawdown heading into the fourth quarter.
 But as more investors piled onto the bearish side of the boat, the market suddenly shot higher. The Russell 2000 abruptly reversed off its lows, and a powerful melt-up move emerged.
 Despite its incredible 20%-plus rally that began at the start of November, the Russell 2000 is just now attacking the top of its range. A breakout above 200 in IWM would be huge – and would set the stage for a catch-up move that could lead to small-caps quickly outperforming the big boys during the first half of 2024.
 You don't need to employ any complicated strategies to take advantage of a small-cap snapback. Simply snag a few shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and you have an excellent chance to double the performance of the S&P 500 during the first half of 2024."

Article:What rough beast slouches towards the opinion pages...?


              
           


SO if the 2024 U.S. ELECTION comes down to Trump versus Biden next November, then Trump will win, 
            says Adrian Ash at BullionVault in this report first sent to clients reading the Weekly Update email on Monday 11 December.


              
           

             Apparently some people need an opinion poll to tell them that.
           

              
           

             ""President Biden's political standing is at its weakest point of his presidency,"" says the 
            Wall Street Journal, reporting a new survey...
           

              
           

             ""...with voters giving him his lowest job-performance marks and favoring Donald Trump 47% to 43% in 
            a head-to-head test of the likely 2024 presidential matchup.""
           

              
           

             Given our focus here at BullionVault, what might Trump's second coming do to the gold price?
           

              
           

             ""If Trump is perceived to have an improved probability of winning the Presidential race, that is 
            likely to be supportive of gold prices,"" says one analyst... 
           

              
           

             ...blah-blahing to the news-wires back in September 2016, two months before The Donald's first win for the Republican Party.
           

              
           

             Come that November, 
            gold prices ""surged higher in light of a possible Trump victory"" because ""risk aversion has risen noticeably"" said a Swiss refiner and a German bank in their client notes as the 2016 election drew near. 
           

              
           

             Then, the day before the result, ""It looks like the market is [now] overwhelmingly pricing in a [Democrat] Clinton victory,"" said another analyst, 
            ""weighing on gold prices"". 
           

              
           

             Oh yeah?
           

              
           




              
           

             Gold leapt on the day of Trump's victory in November 2016...
           

              
           

             ...adding $75 per ounce as the result became clear.
           

              
           

             ""[This echoes the UK's] Brexit referendum at the end of June,"" said yet another pundit, ""when gold surged by nearly 10% within just a few days after the vote."" 
           

              
           

             But bigger picture, that jump was a feint, a fake-out, a mere spike within 
            gold's then-ongoing downwards trading trend.
           

              
           

             And even though Trump was going to prove dreadful for America and for the entire world according to pretty much every financial expert and political pundit, the price of gold in fact sank $200 from that top over the following 2 weeks...
           

              
           

             ...while the US stock market kick-started a 2-year run of new all-time highs.
           

              
           

             Poor old gold wouldn't top its 2016 high until mid-2019. By then, the S&P500 index had risen by more than 36% from the day of Trump's victory.
           

              
           

             So if we're going to get a repeat at the 2024 election, is now the time to cut gold, buy stocks?
           

              
           

             US customers of BullionVault certainly eased off gold during Trump's first term, with the number of buyers down 10% in 2017-2019 compared to the prior 3 years as the number of sellers rose by that same percentage.
           

              
           

             North American 
            gold ETFs also saw less demand, almost halving the rate of growth in 2017-2018 compared with 2015-2016. But most dramatic by far was the reaction of US gold-coin buyers.
           

              
           




              
           

             With a Republican in the White House – the 
            gold-loving Donald Trump, no less, if not 
            the Golden Toilet artwork the Guggenheim in New York offered him on loan – who needed to hoard and hide so much yellow, shiny stuff at home anymore?
           

              
           

             Firearms also saw US sales sink during Trump's first term. Indeed, the maker of Smith & Wesson guns declared bankruptcy in 2019...
           

              
           

             ...thanks in part to 
            the massive debts it got lumped with by a leveraged buy-out 10 years before...
           

              
           

             ...but also because, again, there was a Republican in the White House. So there was little-to-zero risk of anyone restricting Americans' right to bear arms. So there was 
            less rush to stockpile guns and ammo for fear of the Democrats trying to take them off you.
           

              
           

             Covid flipped that trend in 2020, but the surge in Smith & Wesson's sales then 
            accelerated a further 67% in 2021 after Biden took over from Trump.
           

              
           

             So will fear and insecurity ease back if Trump wins the White House again? Not according to the consensus financial view.
           

              
           

             ""If you think Trump 1.0 was wild, wait 'til you see Trump 2.0,"" said a macro-economist I heard speak at a seminar here in London earlier this month. By his own account, Trump will up-end the West's support for Ukraine, effectively gifting victory to Russia. He will up-end world trade too, by imposing US import tariffs on stuff from everywhere – 100% of goods – rather than 'only' on the 30% which comes from China.
           

              
           

             That scenario does not, by itself, mean gold or the other precious metals would rise. And while geopolitical tensions, plus 
            US tariffs hitting international trade, don't sound good for Western stock markets, that's what pretty much everyone thought of Trump's tactics the first time around.
           

              
           

             What if he doesn't get to run? What if Trump is blocked by the multiple fraud cases he's now fighting over his personal business affairs, or jailed outright for stoking the January 6th storming of the Capitol in 2021?
           

              
           

             ""There 
            will be riots, the country will burn,"" reckons former Fox New anchor and Republican media favourite Megyn Kelly. Or put another way...
           

              
           

""Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;


""Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...""


              
           

             This poem, W.B.Yeats' 'The Second Coming', was quoted by Irish economist David McWilliams at 
            the LBMA annual conference this October.
           

              
           

             Yeats' gloom seemed very apt given the horrors in Israel, the misery in Gaza, the continued suffering and slaughter in Ukraine, and the risk of worsening conflict and political deaths worldwide in 2024.
           

              
           

             But then 
            'The Second Coming' – written in 1919 as the horrors of WW1 were followed by the deadly 'Spanish flu' pandemic – 
            also seemed very apt when McWilliams quoted it to discuss the social and economic impact of Covid back in 2020...
           

              
           

             ...and it seemed all-too apt 4 years before that, when the possibility of Trump becoming US President for the first time sent journalists, pundits and analysts rushing to find something scary to say about it.
           

              
           

             ""Yeats' poem experienced a huge revival in 2016,"" says literary critic Michiko Kakutani's book 
            The Death of Truth, lamenting Trump (as well as Brexit, populism and pretty much everything else) a couple of years later, midway through his first term.
           

              
           

             ""It was quoted in news articles 
            more in the first half of that year than it had been in three decades.""
           

              
           

             Here on the cusp of 2024, we already know what kind of ""rough beast"" might be ""slouching"" towards the White House for a second time next year. And while we might want to question the consensus view that Trump will prove simply terrible for the economy, we should most likely expect a new revival for Yeats' gloomy old verse as a result.
           

              
           

             ""The more quotable Yeats seems to commentators and politicians,"" says Irish writer Fintan O'Toole, ""the 
            worse things are."" Or maybe things just seem worse to the type of 
            people who like to quote gloomy poems as a shortcut to making some kind of point.
           

              
           




              
           

             Surely some revelation is at hand even as this rough beast troubles our sight as it bothers the opinion pages yet again.
           

              
           

""A shape with lion body and the head of a man,


""A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun...""


              
           

             No mention of 
            a luscious wig or having 
            small hands. But as things stand so far in the 2020s, it's becoming increasingly hard to say that gold doesn't love bad news.
           

              
           

             So what might 2024 bring? With gold now back above $2000 and silver at $24 per Troy ounce, how gloomy (or not) will it prove to your personal finances?

            2024 gold and silver price forecasts from investors choosing to use BullionVault now."
2023-12-17,"Title:Can Milei Really Close Argentina's Central Bank?
Article:Post-Socialist President pushes ahead...

 The MONUMENTAL fiscal and monetary hole that Peronists Massa and Fernández have left for Javier Milei is difficult to replicate, writes IE Business School in Madrid professor Daniel Lacalle in this article first published in English at Mises.org and reposted by the Cobden Centre.
 Ex-president Mauricio Macri himself explained that the inheritance Milei receives is ""worse"" than the one he found from Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Peronism leaves a country in ruins and with a massive time bomb for the next administration.
 The enormous economic problems of Argentina start with a primary fiscal deficit of 3% of GDP and a total deficit (including interest expenses) exceeding 5% of GDP. Moreover, it is a structural deficit that cannot be reduced unless public spending is slashed. Public expenditure already accounts for 40% of GDP and has doubled in the era of Kirchnerism. If we analyze Argentina's budget, up to 20% is purely political spending. The previous left-wing administration only cut spending on pensions, which were half of the adjustment in real terms, according to the Argentine Institute of Fiscal Analysis.
 Massa and Fernández's interventionist policies and price controls have left a shortage of meat and gasoline in a country rich in oil and livestock, demonstrating again what Milton Friedman said: ""Will we read next that government control of prices has created a shortage of sand in the Sahara?""
 We must not forget that the Fernandez administration leaves Argentina with an annual inflation rate of 140% following an insane increase in the monetary base of more than 485% in five years, according to the Central Bank of Argentina.
 This confiscatory and extractive fiscal and monetary policies have created a disaster in the central bank reserves. Fernandez leaves a bankrupt central bank with negative net reserves of $12 billion and a time bomb in remunerated liabilities (Leliqs) that exceed 12% of GDP and effectively mean more money printing and inflation in the future, when they mature. With a country risk of 2,400 basis points, the self-proclaimed ""socialism of the 21st century"" government has left Argentina and its central bank officially bankrupt, with 40% of the population in poverty and with a failed currency.
 Milei must now confront this poisoned legacy with determination and courage. Macri, who suffered from the error of gradualism, recently argued that there was no room for mild measures, and he is right.
 Milei has promised to shut down the central bank and Dollarize the economy. However, can it be accomplished?
 The answer is yes. Absolutely.
 To understand why Argentina must Dollarize, the reader must know that the Peso is a failed currency that even Argentine citizens reject. Most Argentine citizens already save what they can in US Dollars and conduct all major transactions in the US currency, because they know that their local currency will be dissolved by government interventionism. The government has 15 different exchange rates for the Peso, all fake of course, all of which have only one objective: to steal from citizens their US Dollars at a fake exchange rate.
 The central bank is bankrupt, with negative net reserves, and the Peso is a failed currency. Therefore, shutting down the central bank is essential, and the country needs to have an independent regulator without the power to print currency and monetize all the fiscal deficit, and it must eliminate the possibility of issuing the insane Leliq (remunerated debt) that destroys the currency today and in the future.
 Shutting down the central bank requires an immediate and strong solution to the Leliqs, which will have to include a realistic approach to the monetary mismatch in a country where the ""official exchange rate"" is half the real market rate against the US Dollar. Taking a bold step to recognize this monetary mismatch, closing the central bank, and ending the monetization of debt are three essential steps to end a path to the destruction of a country comparable to that of Venezuela. Milei understands this and knows that the US Dollars that citizens save with enormous difficulty should flow back to the domestic economy by recognizing the monetary reality of the country making the US Dollar a legal tender for all transactions.
 The monetary issue is one side of a hugely problematic coin. The fiscal problem needs to be addressed. Milei needs to put an end to the bloated fiscal deficit, and that requires an adjustment that eliminates political spending without destroying pensions. This must involve selling some of the many inefficient and bloated public companies and the excess spending in purely political subsidies. Secondly, Milei must put an end to the ridiculous trade deficit. Argentina must slash the misguided protectionist and interventionist laws if the Peronists are open to the world to export all they can. To do this, it needs to put an end to the ridiculous ""currency exchange rate clamp"" and the 15 false exchange rates that the government uses to expropriate Dollars from citizens and exporters with unfair rates and confiscations.
 Taxes need to be lowered in a country that has 165 taxes and the highest tax wedge in the region, where small and medium-sized enterprises pay up to 100% of their sales.
 Argentina must change what is currently a confiscatory and predatory state. Additionally, bureaucratic barriers, protectionist measures, and political subsidies must be removed. Furthermore, Milei must ensure legal certainty and an attractive and reliable regulatory framework where the ghost of expropriation and institutional theft does not return.
 Milei's challenges are many, and the opposition will try to sabotage all market-friendly reforms because many politicians in Argentina became very powerful and rich turning the country into a new Venezuela.
 If Argentina wants to become a thriving economy that returns to prosperity, it needs a stable macroeconomic and monetary system. It must recognize it has a failed currency and a bankrupt central bank and implement the urgent measures required as quickly as possible. It will be difficult but not impossible, and the potential of the economy is enormous.
 Argentina was a rich country made poor by socialism. It needs to abandon socialism to become rich again."
2023-12-16,"Title:Fed Playing Politics with 2024 Rate Cuts?
Article:Victory declared on inflation...

 The FED just declared victory over inflation, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 ""While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.""
 Thus Powell issued his wink and his nod to Wall Street on Wednesday.
 His statement followed the December confabulation of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee – so-called.
 Wall Street heard only the first component of his statement. Stocks were up and away before he could complete the second.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyshot nearly 500 points higher. For the first instance ever...the index breached 37,000.
 Both S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite enjoyed similar days at the races.
 All three indexes then shed some steam, but rising bond prices mean yields on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note are in swift retreat.
 4.28% on Monday, three days later, yields withdrew to 3.93%.
 And gold – if you can believe it – thundered $53 higher on the day.
 Why? Like the stock market, gold evidently heard Powell's statement. It believes the Federal Reserve is through. Its rate hike cycle is ended.
 And like Wall Street, gold has noted the Federal Reserve's ""dot plot"". That is the Federal Reserve's own divinations of the interest rate trajectory. It reveals that Federal Reserve officials anticipate three rate cuts next year – and an additional four in 2025.
 Today's 5.25-5.50% target rate would plunge to 3.5-3.75%. So we must assume the Federal Reserve expects inflation to retreat to the identical range. Thus Powell and mates would attain their cherished ""neutral rate"".
 That is the elusive rate that neither pushes nor pulls the economy. Hence, ""neutral"".
 Does the dot plot provide a reliable tour of the future? It does not. Notes Jim Rickards:
 ""The dots are meaningless and are regarded as a joke around Fed headquarters in Washington.""
 Yet as Jim further notes, markets take them quite heavily:
 ""Wall Street analysts and mainstream media focus obsessively on the dots like ancient seers sifting through the entrails of a slaughtered goat.""
 In these entrails markets have discovered the portents they seek. These of course are rate cuts.
 Thus the joy on Wall Street – and in the London bullion market. Yet a question presents itself: Why does the Federal Reserve anticipate three rate reductions next year? And four more the year after?
 After all...despite its rate hike crusade...unemployment gutters at 3.7% – handsome!
 Meantime, the gross domestic product expanded 5.2% in the year's third quarter.
 At least, that is, in the official telling. We are not half so convinced it is true.
 Yet the Federal Reserve believes it. And it conducts itself accordingly. Its Atlanta outpost presently projects a 2.6% fourth-quarter expansion.
 2.6% growth is not 5.2% growth. Yet it is growth. And growth is growth.
 In brief, data indicates the United States economy is pushing along at fair speed. It has withstood the Federal Reserve's gales blowing in over the bow.
 So again we ask: Why does the Federal Reserve anticipate seven rate reductions through 2025?
 Perhaps heavy weather has appeared upon its radar screen?
 Economic performance lags in back of monetary policy. It is often 18 months behind. The Federal Reserve commenced its rate hikes last March – 21 months distant. That is, the United States economy still outruns monetary policy. The rate hikes have yet to run it down.
 We hazard it is due to the deluges of fiscal stimulus that washed over the economy these past three years. It has postponed the chasing-down, the catching-up. Yet the flooding water is on the ebb. The stimulus has largely evaporated and vanished into air.
 And with it, economic expansion. It appears the rate hikes are at last running down the economy. They are closing in. Jim Rickards:
 ""Recession signs are real and growing worse. These include credit contraction, rising bad debts, increasing jobless claims, collapsing commercial real estate markets, contracting world trade, inverted yield curves and many other reliable technical indicators.""
 Here is another question to consider. It is seditious and malicious. It casts into doubt the Federal Reserve's famous neutrality and independence. Thus we ask it only in shame...and our head droops accordingly.
 Is politics steering Federal Reserve policy? Is it attempting to influence next year's presidential election?
 Peter Tchir of Academy Securities:
 ""Powell did not push back on markets or try and 'undo' any of the bullishness the dots and statement elicited – he has in the past, so that was important.
 ""He was almost dismissive of any question regarding how much markets had eased financial conditions since the last meeting. This shocked me the most as he had every opportunity to use the dramatic market moves to sound hawkish. Hawkish rhetoric was handed to him on a silver platter, and he dismissed it.
 ""Finally...he pretty much took a victory lap [on inflation]. That too was a major change.""
 Consider: Core inflation hovers at 4%. That is twice the Federal Reserve's cherished 2% rate.
 Why are they abandoning their anti-inflation crusade now?
 They have yet to capture Jerusalem – though it shimmers tantalizingly before them.
 More:
 ""Basically, we felt the Fed would be far more reluctant to trigger a recession during an election year than they were in 2023...They know recessions influence elections (negatively for the incumbents) and we suspected they would want to avoid that.
 ""The tone out of D.C. on inflation and rates has changed noticeably over the course of the year, which supports this somewhat awkward (but realistic) view. So maybe that played into the shift in tone from the Fed...?""
 Jim Rickards is convinced the Federal Reserve is a sharp political calculator:
 ""Don't let anyone tell you the Fed is not political. They are hyper-political; it's just that they do a good job of hiding it. They know 2024 is an election year. They don't want to be blamed for a recession if they go too far, and don't want to be blamed for inflation if they haven't gone far enough.
 ""Their strategy [was] to finish the job of rate hikes in September. Then they will rely on lagged effects (and continued balance sheet reduction) to finish off inflation but distance themselves from a potential recession if one emerges in mid-to-late 2024.
 ""The Fed's hands will be clean. They can blame bad outcomes on fiscal policy and politicians. The Fed's ideal is to finish in September and then go to the sidelines for a year.""
 Is Jim correct? We are not certain. Yet we slant – heavily perhaps – in his direction.
 Where is the Federal Reserve headquartered? In Washington, District of Columbia. What is that city's central occupation? Politics. To expect the Federal Reserve to escape politics is to expect fish to escape water. It surrounds them and cocoons them.
 One question lingers:
 Can the Federal Reserve postpone the looming recession – the gathering recession – until the election?

Article:Time for your pre-flight investment checks...

WHAT's the scariest thing you can imagine about piloting an aircraft solo? asks Tim Price of Price Value Partners.
 How about suddenly losing your sight at altitude?
 This is exactly what happened to the private pilot Jim O'Neill in October 2008, whilst flying his single-engine Cessna back home from Prestwick in Scotland to Colchester in south-eastern England.
 While over northern Yorkshire, about halfway through his flight, O'Neill radioed a Mayday alert, saying he could no longer see his cockpit instrumentation. At first he thought his vision was being impacted by sunlight.
 Air traffic controllers then noticed that his plane was descending, and turning.
 RAF controllers initially tried to help the pilot land at an RAF base east of York, but after he failed to locate the base despite several attempts, they redirected him to the base at Linton-on-Ouse, 20 miles to the north-west.
 The 'New York Times' picks up the story:
 The Linton base's chief flying instructor, Wing Cmdr. Paul Gerrard, already airborne in a Tucano single-engine aircraft used to train RAF pilots, was directed to approach Mr.O'Neill's plane and flew alongside him for more than 40 minutes at a distance of about 150 feet, Wing Commander Hynd said.
 ""He used his voice to guide him down by telling him to turn left and right, to lower the plane and to do his prelanding checks,"" the commander said. ""At very short range he still couldn't see the runway, and it was only at the last minute that he could. He landed about halfway down and came to a halt just at the end.""
 A tape recording of the exchanges between Wing Commander Gerrard and Mr.O'Neill was played at a news conference at the Linton base on Friday, as the RAF began a weekend celebration of its 90th anniversary.
 On the recording, the RAF pilot could be heard saying, ""Keep the nose down, keep the nose down,"" as the two aircraft approached the runway.
 ""I'm really sorry about this,"" Mr.O'Neill replied, as the RAF pilot continued to coax him down. At low level, Mr.O'Neill repeated that he was still flying blind.
 ""I cannot see the runway,"" he said.
 ""You should see it very shortly,"" Wing Commander Gerrard replied. ""It's really nearly under your nose now.""
 With his aircraft already over the runway, Mr.O'Neill finally confirmed that he could see it.
 ""I've got it now, sir,"" he said. ""Thank you.""
 After a successful landing, Mr.O'Neill was taken to hospital in Romford, near Colchester. It transpired that he had been blinded when a stroke caused an increase in pressure on his optic nerves. He subsequently recovered partial sight in one eye. At the time the story was published, there was hope that he might eventually regain sight in both eyes. His son Douglas reported that his father had sent a message to the RAF, thanking them for saving his life.
 For most pilots, of course, ""flying blind"" never happens quite so literally.
 The expression ""flying blind"" dates back to World War II, when pilots were unable to locate the horizon because of darkness or cloud cover; they were forced to rely on what were invariably quite rudimentary navigational aids. Many became spatially disorientated (SD'd), experienced vertigo, and crashed. Even today pilots following instrument flight rules (IFR) are not immune from problems.
 The US Air Force investigated 633 crashes between 1980 and 1989 and found that spatial disorientation was identified in 13% of cases as a contributory factor. Pilots following visual flight rules (VFR), when experiencing weather conditions that require navigational instrumentation, have a life expectancy of less than three minutes.
 But Houston, we have a problem. The single most important actors in the global financial markets, the world's central banks – well, they are flying blind. Having introduced the radical monetary policies of Quantitative Easing (QE) – the creation out of thin air of money that is then essentially gifted to the banking sector in order to buy government and now corporate bonds, and now in some cases equities, too – they have gone on to implement ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy), and in many cases have followed that up with NIRP (Negative Interest Rate Policy).
 Now we have had monetary tightening, which has sent the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds (for example) since 2020 from under 1% to over 5%, albeit with a brief current lull.
 Where and when will this insanity end? Criticising our central banks only gets you so far, in the same way that repeatedly banging your head against the wall only gets you so far. The mainstream financial media and our politicians aren't listening. In many cases – the FT and The Economist take one step forward, please – they have cheered on the central banks to the very echo.
 Merryn Somerset Webb recently observed that at an FT event at which she spoke, she was followed by the paper's chief economics correspondent, Martin Wolf, who recommended banning cash altogether. We are surrounded by madmen.
 So the critical question for all investors is: are you flying blind? That is to say, do you have an investment strategy for your life savings?
 Have you diversified your portfolio meaningfully across the available gamut of asset classes and investment choices? (We endeavour to construct portfolios that we believe will hold up under more or less any kind of future financial market environment – including one of potential financial repression and capital controls.)
 We are clearly entering a market environment and, for that matter, a geopolitical environment of acute uncertainty. Not just uncertainty in isolation – the future is always uncertain, and will often prove, after the fact, surprisingly benign – but threat, too.
 Honest question: have you ever been more fearful about your financial future, or that of your loved ones? We haven't. We thought at the time that 2008 would mark the nadir of any type of emotional response to market conditions. If anything, we are even more worried now. And it's not blind panic, but simply the rational response to a financial environment in which those policy 'masters' are running out of magic tricks.
 There may be no more rabbits to be pulled from hats while the stock and bond markets adoringly applaud (or, more latterly, choose to puke). And as we approach the winter solstice, the tricks coming our way may be of a distinctly dark variety. Russell Napier, for example, has been warning of the reintroduction of capital controls for some time. In Argentina, they already got here. And in a possible 'Keef' Starmer government, for example, we may yet get to experience all the fun, thrills and spills of living ""in Venezuela – but with drizzle"".
 As the investment skies darken with chickens coming home to roost, don't let your own 'flight to safety' be thrown off course by exogenous influences like the financial media. Remember, what we should now call the legacy media exist to emotionalise daily life. Recall the cautionary advice of Thomas Schuster of the Institute for Communication and Media Studies at Leipzig University, who has written probably the most damning indictment of the failings of financial media:
 ""The media select, they interpret, they emotionalise and they create facts. The media not only reduce reality by lowering information density. They focus reality by accumulating information where ""actually"" none exists. A typical stock market report looks like this: Stock X increased because...Index Y crashed due to...Prices Z continue to rise after...Most of these explanations are post-hoc rationalizations. An artificial logic is created, based on a simplistic understanding of the markets, which implies that there are simple explanations for most price movements; that price movements follow rules which then lead to systematic patterns; and of course that the news disseminated by the media decisively contribute to the emergence of price movements.""
 Don't let your long term investment plans be thrown into disarray by the siren songs played by clueless members of the commentariat. If in doubt, switch your TV or radio off and throw your newspaper into the bin. And don't forget the equally valuable advice of Rolf Dobelli: Avoid News.
 The beauty of a properly diversified portfolio approach is that you never have to market time. Within our own discretionary client portfolios, for example:

 Gold and real assets provide us with a degree of portfolio insurance, inflation insurance and financial crisis insurance;
 Systematic trend-following funds provide us with more of the same;
 Unconstrained value equities provide us with the potential for attractive longer term returns, but without taking what we consider an unacceptable level of price risk, given potential geopolitical and economic developments;
 And, almost regardless of how we feel about the financial markets, a blend of the investments and asset classes above – adjusted, of course, according to personal taste – enables us to be fully invested at all times without, we hope and trust, losing the facility to sleep well at night.

That word trust, again.
 At the end of the day, a functioning civil society can only exist on the back of trust. Our friend, the fund manager and financial analyst Dylan Grice:
 ""At its most fundamental level, economic activity is no more than an exchange between strangers. It depends, therefore, on a degree of trust between strangers. Since money is the agent of exchange, it is the agent of trust. Debasing money therefore debases trust. History is replete with Great Disorders in which social cohesion has been undermined by currency debasements. The multi-decade credit inflation can now be seen to have had similarly corrosive effects. Yet central banks continue down the same route. The writing is on the wall. Further debasement of money will cause further debasement of society. I fear a Great Disorder.
 ""I am more worried than I have ever been about the clouds gathering today. I hope they pass without breaking, but I fear the defining feature of coming decades will be a Great Disorder of the sort which has defined past epochs and scarred whole generations.""
 ""Next to language, money is the most important medium through which modern societies communicate,"" writes Bernd Widdig in his masterful analysis of Germany's inflation crisis, Culture and Inflation in Weimar Germany (2001). His may be an abstract observation, but it has the commendable merit of being true.. all economic activity requires the cooperation of strangers and therefore, a degree of trust between cooperating strangers. Since money is the agent of such mutual trust, debasing money implies debasing the trust upon which social cohesion rests.
 ""So I keep wondering to myself,"" says Grice, ""do our money-printing central banks and their cheerleaders understand the full consequences of the monetary debasement they continue to engineer? Inflation of the CPI might be a consequence both seen and measurable. A broad inflation of asset prices might be a consequence seen, though not measurable. But what about the consequences that are unseen but unmeasurable – and are all the more destructive for it? I feel queasy about the enthusiasm with which our wise economists play games with something about which we have such a poor understanding..""
 The Global Financial Crisis of 2007/8 showed that commercial banks cannot be trusted. That almost none of their employees went to jail showed that our political class and all its attendant lobbyists cannot be trusted. The ridiculous 'Basil Fawlty-ish' lengths to which our monetary authorities stretched themselves in the aftermath of the Crisis show that central banks cannot be trusted.
 The tortuous process of Brexit lifted a very broad and dismal veil, revealing that much of Parliament, the news media, and the worlds of showbusiness, academia and Big Business (effectively, almost all of the so-called 'Establishment') cannot be trusted. The counter-Covid insanity did more of the same, only more loudly and with even more fascistic and technocratic intolerance.
 When we take a commercial flight, we trust that the plane will be in good mechanical order, and that its pilots are sober, and fully trained to deal with any contingency that might realistically arise during the course of the flight. In the unlikely event that a plane crashes, the aviation ecosystem works exhaustively to uncover the reasons for the crash and prevent its reoccurrence.
 What doesn't happen is a pilot taking off into the unknown, with no maps, no support crew, no communications with ground control, not having checked his fuel gauge, and with literally no idea of his destination.
 Central bankers, please take note. But forget them. Have you completed your pre-flight checks?"
2023-12-13,"Title:Critical Tax Case of Moore vs. US
Article:Unrealized gains are one thing, unpaid income quite another...

 The 16th Amendment to the US Constitution created the federal income tax, says Jim Rickards at The Daily Reckoning.
 It was ratified in 1913 and says, ""The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""
 This permitted the US to collect income taxes from individuals based on their individual incomes. Prior to the 16th Amendment, Congress relied mostly on tariffs and excise taxes.
 Some income taxes were passed by Congress, but the Supreme Court struck them down on the view that direct taxes on wages, dividends, interest, rents, etc. had to be apportioned among the states based on population.
 The 16th Amendment, in effect, overruled the Supreme Court and allowed the direct income taxes we have today. Still, that begs the question: What is income?
 It has long been the case that income must be realized before it can be taxed.
 A paycheck or dividend distribution is certainly realized. But what about stock gains? If you buy a share of Nvidia at $10 and it goes to $500, do you have to pay tax on that gain? The answer is no, unless you sell it.
 If you buy and hold, no gain has been realized and no tax is due. Once you sell it for $500, you have to pay tax on the $490 gain. So far, so good. It's really pretty simple.
 But over the past 100 years, Congress, the Treasury and the IRS have created hundreds of exceptions to the realization requirement.
 For example, if you own stock in a private company and you transfer the shares to an offshore company that you also own, there is no realization. You did not get any cash or other property on the transfer.
 Still, the IRS says there is a ""deemed"" realization and some tax is due. This is designed to prevent citizens from later selling the stock offshore outside the US taxing jurisdiction.
 Other examples include partnership taxation where a withdrawing partner may be deemed to have income on the unrealized value of partnership assets even though she received no cash. It gets more complicated from there, but you get the idea.
 Of course, the Biden administration is keen to tax unrealized gains. And just recently, 15 senators introduced wealth tax legislation intended to tax unrealized gains.
 Now, a married couple has challenged the entire system of ""deemed"" realization and says that there is no income unless the asset is actually sold or exchanged for cash or other property.
 They claim they're being taxed on earnings that hadn't yet been distributed to them by a foreign corporation. They're arguing that taxing these unreceived earnings is unconstitutional.
 Here's some background. I'm not going to get too deeply into the weeds here, but it helps to know a bit about the case.
 In 2006, the couple invested $40,000 in a foreign corporation. Between 2006 and 2017, the company reinvested all its earnings in the business. So the couple didn't receive any dividend payments or other income.
 But the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provided a new federal tax called the ""mandatory repatriation tax"" that applied to investors in overseas corporations. This new tax treated investors' share of a corporation's undistributed earnings like they were actually distributed to the shareholders.
 To the surprise of many, the US Supreme Court has taken up the case and is hearing oral arguments.
 The attorney representing the taxpayers argued, ""'Income' was understood at the time of the 16th Amendment's adoption to refer to gains coming into the taxpayer, like wages, rents and dividends. Appreciation in the value of a home, a stock investment or other property is not and never has been taxed as income.""
 He went on to say, ""That's not how the income tax has ever worked going back to 1913. Again, the reason the law doesn't work that way is the obvious one. Unrealized gains are not income. The only way to make sense of the income tax as it's existed for a century is to stick with the original meaning of the 16th Amendment. The Court should reaffirm that there is no income without realization.""
 Meanwhile, the attorney representing the government argued that the 16th Amendment doesn't actually require that income must be realized before it can be taxed.
 She said the 16th Amendment doesn't explicitly mention realization, and that ""income"" has a broader meaning than only gains that have been realized. She also argued that Congress has the legitimate authority to tax unrealized gains under its broad authority to regulate commerce.
 If the Supreme Court rules for the government and finds that income tax doesn't require realized income, it could pave the way for a federal wealth tax that Democrats are pushing for.
 But if the court rules in favor of the taxpayers, this could blow a big hole in the US budget as the revenue currently collected by the IRS on deemed sales is lost."
2023-12-11,"Title:US Jobless Smile Widens
Article:November beat forecasts, but the trend could be turning...

 NOVEMBER Payrolls rose a bit more than expected, says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Among the 199,000 additional jobs against 190,000 analysts forecast, ""Job gains occurred in healthcare and government,"" says the report from the BLS.
 Why of course they did. From Wednesday's post after the ADP jobs report:
 ""Again, we'll get a better idea of details in Friday's payrolls report, but Dollars to donuts certain hard services like healthcare (and maybe government) are doing the work now. That's not productive (or leading) at all.""
 So anyway, Hazel's Leisure & Hospitality services were pretty good, while Education & Health services boomed and Government stuck its beak in again. Let's also acknowledge that Manufacturing employment bounced back. I have not looked at the report yet, but I'll bet that auto workers have something to do with that.
 
 Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked down but still maintains the fledgling potential for a bottom and upturn into the next recession."
2023-12-10,"Title:Inflation Outcomes for 401k and IRA Savers
Article:Making real money for your retirement...

 Do you own a 401(k) retirement account? Do you own an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)? asks Brian Maher at The Daily Reckoning.
 Gobs of Americans own either or both – oftentimes both.
 Let us assume you are among them. How well have these retirement accounts done you these past 2½ years?
 How much have they expanded your wealth?
 Here we refer not to nominal wealth but to ""real wealth"". That is, nominal wealth subtracted by the inflation rate.
 We need not remind you that inflation has enjoyed a lovely spree in recent times. A man's portfolio may deliver him $1 million across 2½ years. Yet what if the Dollar in which he trades loses 50% across the same span?
 In inflation-adjusted terms – in real terms – he has taken in $500,000.
 $500,000 is handsome. Yet it is not $1 million. It constitutes a 50% sawing.
 Again we ask: How has your portfolio performed...in real terms...these past 2½ years?
 Your choices are these:

 Your real retirement account has increased 50%. You wallow gorgeously in clover.
 Your real retirement account has increased 25%.
 You have stood in place – your gain is zero. Whatever nominal gains you have acquired, inflation has claimed.
 You have actually lost 25% in real terms.
 You have lost an impossible 50% in real terms.

Have you made your selection?
 Option D is the answer.
 Your portfolio has absorbed a real 25% gouging these past 2.5 years.
 Your $100,000 is really $75,000, your $500,000 is really $375,000, your $1000,000 is really $750,000.
 How do you like it?
 Let us assume you are nearing retirement. You believe – naively perhaps – that $1 million will see you through to the grave.
 To your everlasting delight your financial statement reports that you are the owner of $1 million. You have attained your target.
 Yet in real terms you have not attained your target. In real terms you are not the owner of $1 million. You are instead the owner of $750,000.
 And do your retirement dreams go upon the shelf. Inflation has claimed them.
 How many additional years must you toil to attain your real $1 million target?
 You can scarcely bear to consider it...and plunge into a despairing slough. You are undone.
 A certain E.J. Antoni is a public finance economist at the conservative-oriented Heritage Foundation. From whom:
 ""Bidenomics has reduced the real value of the average 401(k) by a quarter in the last 2½ years.
 ""The study, published with the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, examined individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and pension plans and found shocking losses under the Biden administration, enough to delay many Americans' retirement plans for years...
 ""Stratospheric inflation, brought on by government spending, borrowing and printing too much money, has...eroded the value of 401(k) plans by $16,200 on average, for a real (inflation-adjusted) loss of around $33,200, or 24.8%.""
 Here this Antoni fellow trains his cannons upon the White House – rather, its principal occupant:
 ""If Biden had simply allowed one-time COVID spending to expire, the federal deficit would've disappeared amid soaring tax receipts while inflation remained low.
 ""Instead, Biden led the way in championing more wasteful spending and multitrillion-Dollar deficits became institutionalized. The impact has been devastating.
 ""Between lost purchasing power from inflation and higher borrowing costs from interest rate hikes, the typical American family has lost the equivalent of $7,300 in annual income under Biden.
 ""Families have racked up a record $1.1 trillion in credit card debt while savings have plummeted. Sadly, a record number of Americans are also using hardship withdrawals to tap their retirement savings because they can no longer afford necessities like rent and groceries.""
 Even those who are getting by have seen their savings crushed. Again: How do you like it?
 Yet all is not grim. The unemployment rate – for example – dangles at a lovely 3.9%. Americans are massively employed.
 Is it because they are happily employed? Or is it because many Americans have chased secondary employment to keep body and soul together?
 Here is a run of recent headlines:
 ""More Americans Are Working Two Jobs to Make Ends Meet""...
 ""More Americans Have Two Jobs or More, a Sign of Inflation's Burden""...
 ""Survey: 39% Have a Side Hustle, and 44% Believe They'll Always Need One.""
 Thus we rechristen the administration's Inflation Reduction Act...the Unemployment Reduction Act.
 That is because the Inflation ""Reduction"" Act kindled so much inflation it forced millions into secondary employment.
 Do you disbelieve in the efficacy of government programs? Well, friend, here is one example of success – success beyond measure.
 We refer you once again to the 3.9% unemployment rate.
 Thus the president can take to the campaign trail and holler that he is a veritable jobs factory.
 ""Look at all the jobs I've created!""
 Greater genius we have rarely – if ever – glimpsed. A dozen Einsteins chained together could scarcely conceive of it. We hazard more of it will one day reduce the unemployment rate to zero.
 And so today we issue a thunderous demand.
 A thunderous demand, that is, that the Inflation Reduction Act be renewed in perpetuity, each and every year, world without end.
 Must Americans work two jobs, three jobs, four jobs to attain zero unemployment?
 Perhaps they may. Yet it makes no difference. Zero unemployment is zero unemployment. And zero unemployment is economic nirvana, an economic El Dorado.
 Thus today we issue our impassioned plea...to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell...to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen...to Joseph Biden himself...
 Deliver us greater inflation – the nation's salvation requires it!"
2023-12-09,"Title:Charlie Munger's American Dream
Article:Buffett's righthand man passed away at age 99...

 The LIFE STORY of Charlie Munger, who passed away last week at age 99, serves as a shining example of the enduring American Dream, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 That's especially so now, at a time when many people doubt whether the promise of a better life is still intact. On the contrary, I believe that Munger's journey, coupled with data from the updated Forbes 400 list, reaffirms that the American Dream still thrives.
 Charlie Munger's life began in a modest Midwestern town, far from the glamor of Wall Street. His early years were marked by hardships, including a marriage that ended in divorce, a rarity at the time, which left him with little in the way of assets.
 But adversity was not done with him yet. Munger's son Teddy fell victim to leukemia, and Charlie bore the financial strain of his son's illness, paying for everything out of pocket. Tragically, Teddy passed away at the tender age of nine, devastating Charlie.
 In the face of such overwhelming challenges – failed marriage, financial ruin, the loss of his beloved son, and then the surgical removal of his left eye following a botched cataract surgery – I suspect it must have been tempting for Munger to surrender to the vices that many others have succumbed to.
 Fortunately for him, it was around this time that the future billionaire's path intersected with a quirky investor from Omaha, Nebraska, by the name of Warren Buffett. Together, the two value investors began buying distressed shares in an old textile company called Berkshire Hathaway. The rest, as they say, is history.
 Between 1992 and 2022, Berkshire delivered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%, beating the S&P approximately two-thirds of the time on an annual basis. Had an investor bought $100 of Berkshire shares in 1978, when Munger joined the company, that investment would be worth around $400,000 today, far outstripping the S&P500.
 
 James Truslow Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who coined the term ""American Dream"", defined it in 1931 as the ""dream of a better, richer and happier life for all our citizens of every rank.""
 Does the dream still hold true? Today, many Americans can't help but have second guesses.
 According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NORC survey, only 36% of American adults still believe in the American Dream, a significant drop from 53% in 2012 and 48% in 2016. Roughly two-thirds of respondents said that the American Dream either once held true but no longer or never held true to begin with. What's more, half of people believe that life in the US has worsened over the past half-century.
 It's undeniable that the US faces historic economic challenges right now. Despite higher interest rates, inflation remains sticky, increasing 3.2% year-over-year in October. Homeownership is arguably the most important component of the American Dream, but due to sky-high mortgage rates, housing affordability is at record lows, as are pending home sales.
 As dire as this sounds, I'm optimistic that the worst is behind us. Pain is temporary, and hope will prevail.
 Don't take it from me, though. The updated Forbes 400 list, released in October, reveals an encouraging trend. Over two-thirds of today's billionaires are self-made, a remarkable increase from less than half in 1984. In 2023, an astonishing 70% of billionaires built their fortunes from the ground up.
 Among these self-made billionaires, 29 earned a score of 10, indicating that they once lived below the poverty line or faced significant adversity during their journey to success. The list includes individuals like former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who grew up in a Brooklyn housing project, and David Murdock, the former CEO of Dole Food Company and a war veteran who briefly experienced homelessness.
 This diversity of backgrounds and stories within the ranks of the wealthiest Americans underscores the resilience of the American Dream.
 In these times of doubt and uncertainty, Charlie Munger's life story reminds us that the American Dream is not a relic of the past. It is very much alive, thriving, and within the reach of those who dare to dream, work hard and persevere through adversity. Munger's journey from the depths of despair to becoming a billionaire and a revered figure in the world of finance speaks volumes about the opportunities that still exist in this great nation.
 Let us draw inspiration from his legacy as well as the stories of self-made billionaires who continue to shape the landscape of American success."
2023-12-08,"Title:2024 Soft Landing Cheerleading Continues
Article:Everything's just fine, stop worrying...

 As EMPLOYMENT decelerates, the media continue to choose to see a Goldilocks ""soft landing"" scenario, and it's right in line with a seasonal ""last chance power drive"", writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 Never mind that a soft landing is more myth than reality, at least in the boom/bust age of Inflation onDemand birthed by Alan Greenspan well over two decades ago.
 Let's see how Friday's November Payrolls report shakes out, but in the interim Wednesday morning came another sign of the happy seasonal market tout for the fabled soft landing courtesy of the ADP Payrolls report.
 Here is the summary from CNBC with a certain internet wise guy's markups.
 
 So Hazel's vaunted services industry in general keeps the Good Ship Lollipop's rudder sailing a serpentine yet relatively true course (although her particular hospitality segment is flagging and if I could wipe that grotesque smile off her face, I would).
 Little in this report bodes well. Services-related industries provided all the job gains for the month, as goods-producers saw a net loss of 14,000 due to declines of 15,000 in manufacturing, despite the settlement in the United Auto Workers strikes, and 4,000 in construction.
 Recent layoffs in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street also did not show up in the data, as both sectors posted gains on the month.
 ""Restaurants and hotels were the biggest job creators during the post-pandemic recovery,"" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. ""But that boost is behind us, and the return to trend in leisure and hospitality suggests the economy as a whole will see more moderate hiring and wage growth in 2024.""
 The media will never follow the negative progression that is probably in play. The economy is decelerating. Again, we'll get a better idea of details in Friday's payrolls report, but Dollars to donuts certain hard services like healthcare (and maybe government) are doing the work now. That's not productive (or leading) at all.
 The financial media (and likely your financial adviser) will focus on the interim, which is technically still a not too hot, not too cold Goldilocks phase. Rah rah sis boom bah! Strike up a cheer, girls!
 
 I have had to spend a lot of time over the last 2 decades acting as if I am bullish on this casino because that is what inflationary policy created. But if you think I am becoming more strident lately, more negative, you are not imagining things. When the time would be right I was always ready to see reality, as opposed to what they told me to see.
 I believe, subject to seasonal party animal spirits and a perhaps final stock market suck-in, the party is over for a while."
2023-12-08,"Title:Steepest Deflation Since 1933 Depression
Article:M2 on Rothbard's TMS sank 9% in October...

 U.S. MONEY SUPPLY growth fell again in October, remaining deep in negative territory after turning negative in November 2022 for the first time in twenty-eight years, writes Ryan McMaken, executive editor at the Mises Institute, in this article re-posted at the Cobden Centre.
 October's drop continues a steep downward trend from the unprecedented highs experienced during much of the past two years.
 Since April 2021, money supply growth has slowed quickly, and since November, we've been seeing the money supply repeatedly contract year over year. The last time the year-over-year (YOY) change in the money supply slipped into negative territory was in November 1994. At that time, negative growth continued for fifteen months, finally turning positive again in January 1996.
 Money-supply growth has now been negative for twelve months in a row. During October 2023, the downturn continued as YOY growth in the money supply was at minus 9.33%. That's up slightly from September's rate decline which was of 10.49%, and was far below October 2022's rate of plus 2.14%.
 With negative growth now falling near or below -10% for the eighth month in a row, money-supply contraction is the largest we've seen since the Great Depression. Prior to this year, at no other point for at least sixty years has the money supply fallen by more than 6% (YoY) in any month.
 The money supply metric used here – the ""true"" or Rothbard-Salerno money supply measure (TMS) – is the metric developed by Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno, and is designed to provide a better measure of money supply fluctuations than M2. (The Mises Institute now offers regular updates on this metric and its growth.)
 In recent months, M2 growth rates have followed a similar course to TMS growth rates, although TMS has fallen faster than M2. In October 2023, the M2 growth rate was -3.35%. That's down from September's growth rate of -3.35%. October 2023's growth rate was also well down from October 2022's rate of 1.42%.
 
 Money supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity and an indicator of coming recessions. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as commercial banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by slowing rates of money supply growth.
 It should be noted that the money supply does not need to actually contract to signal a recession and the boom-bust cycle. As shown by Ludwig von Mises, recessions are often preceded by a mere slowing in money supply growth. But the drop into negative territory we've seen in recent months does help illustrate just how far and how rapidly money supply growth has fallen. That is generally a red flag for economic growth and employment.
 The fact that the money supply is shrinking at all is remarkable because the money supply in modern times almost never gets smaller. The money supply has now fallen by $2.8 trillion (or 13.1%) since the peak in April 2022. Proportionally, the drop in money supply since 2022 is the largest fall we've seen since the Depression. (Rothbard estimates that in the lead-up to the Great Depression, the money supply fell by 12% from its peak of $73 billion in mid-1929 to $64 billion at the end of 1932.)
 In spite of this recent drop in total money supply, the trend in money-supply remains well above what existed during the twenty-year period from 1989 to 2009. To return to this trend, the money supply would have to drop at least another $3 trillion or so – or 15% – down to a total below $15 trillion. Moreover, as of October, total money supply was still up 32% (or $4.6 trillion) since January 2020.
 Since 2009, the TMS money supply is now up by nearly 186%. (M2 has grown by 141% in that period.) Out of the current money supply of $18.9 trillion, $4.6 trillion – or 24% – of that has been created since January 2020. Since 2009, $12.2 trillion of the current money supply has been created. In other words, nearly two-thirds of the total existing money supply have been created just in the past thirteen years.
 With these kinds of totals, a ten-percent drop only puts a small dent in the huge edifice of newly created money. The US economy still faces a very large monetary overhang from the past several years, and this is partly why after eighteen months of slowing money-supply growth, we are only now starting to see a slowdown in the labor market. (For example, job openings have fallen 22% over the past year, but have not yet returned to pre-covid levels.) The inflationary boom has not yet ended.
 Nonetheless, the monetary slowdown has been sufficient to considerably weaken the economy. The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing index is in recession territory. The Leading Indicators index keeps looking worse. The yield curve points to recession. Temp jobs were down, year-over-year, which often indicates approaching recession. Default rates are rising.
 An inflationary boom begins to turn to bust once new injections of money subside, and we are seeing this now. Not surprisingly, the current signs of malaise come after the Federal Reserve finally pulled its foot slightly off the money-creation accelerator after more than a decade of quantitative easing, financial repression, and a general devotion to easy money.
 As of early December, the Fed has allowed the federal funds rate to rise to 5.50%, the highest since 2001. This has meant short-term interest rates overall have risen as well. In October, for example, the yield on 3-month Treasurys reached 5.6%, the highest level measured since December 2000.
 Without ongoing access to easy money at near-zero rates, banks are less enthusiastic about making loans, and many marginal companies will no longer be able to stave off financial trouble by refinancing or taking out new loans. Commercial bankruptcy filings increased sizably during 2023, and continue to surge into the last quarter of the year. As reported by Monitor Daily:
 The bankruptcy filing by WeWork in November propelled November commercial Chapter 11 filings to 842, an increase of 141% compared with the 349 filings registered in November 2022, according to data provided by Epiq Bankruptcy.
 The case filed by WeWork on Nov. 6 included 517 related filings, according to analysis from the American Bankruptcy Institute, representing the third-most related filings in a case since the US Bankruptcy Code became effective in 1979.
 Overall commercial filings increased 21% to 2,252 in November, up from the 1,864 commercial filings registered in November 2022. Small business filings, captured as Subchapter V elections within Chapter 11, increased 79% to 181 in November, up from 101 in November 2022.
 There were 37,860 total bankruptcy filings in November, a 21% increase from the November 2022 total of 31,187. Individual bankruptcy filings also registered a 21% year-over-year increase, as the 35,608 in November represented an increase over the 29,323 filings in November 2022. There were 20,250 individual Chapter 7 filings in November, a 23% increase compared with the 16,421 filings recorded in November 2022, and there were 15,280 individual Chapter 13 filings in November, a 19% increase compared with the 12,862 filings last November.
 Lending for private consumption is getting more expensive also. In October, the average 30-year mortgage rate rose to 7.62%, the highest point reached since November 2000. These factors all point toward a bubble that is in the process of popping. The situation is unsustainable, yet the Fed cannot change course without reigniting a new surge in price inflation.
 Although some professional economists insist that price inflation has all but disappeared, the sentiment on the ground is clearly one in which most workers believe their wages are not keeping up with rising prices. Any surge in prices would be especially problematic given the rising cost of living. Ordinary Americans face a similar problem with home prices. According to the Atlanta Fed, the housing affordability index is now the worst it's been since 2006, in the midst of the Housing Bubble.
 If the Fed reverses course now, and embraces a new flood of new money, prices will only spiral upward. It didn't have to be this way, but ordinary people are now paying the price for a decade of easy money cheered by Wall Street and the profligates in Washington. The only way to put the economy on a more stable long-term path is for the Fed to stop pumping new money into the economy.
 That means a falling money supply and popping economic bubbles. But it also lays the groundwork for a real economy – ie, an economy not built on endless bubbles – built by saving and investment rather than spending made possible by artificially low interest rates and easy money."
2023-12-07,"Title:Gold vs. DVO1 at $2000
Article:What explains the gold price surge...?

 Are GOLD PRICES and interest rates joined at the hip? asks Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Based on recent market action, it would appear the answer is: yes.
 A major rally in gold is now underway. Gold moved from $1831 per ounce on Oct. 6 to $2091 per ounce on Dec. 1, a 14.1% rally in just eight weeks and a new all-time high price for gold.
 Gold has pulled back, but that's not surprising given its previous surge. Like every other asset, gold can sometimes get ahead of itself and experience a pullback.
 This rally correlated almost perfectly with the rally in the price of 10-year Treasury notes that occurred at the same time. Treasury note yields plunged from 5.00% on Oct. 19 to 4.17%. That 83-basis point drop may seem small but it's not.
 That's like an earthquake in the world of Treasury notes. As explained below, market signs indicate that these dual rallies and close correlations will continue for months to come.
 This dual rally gives investors a double-barreled opportunity to make huge gains.
 As interest rates drop, the market value of Treasury notes goes up. That's bond math 101. Yet there's a quirk in the bond math that many investors (and even financial advisers) don't appreciate.
 When interest rates drop, bond prices go up. But the rate at which they go up relative to each drop in rates (measured in basis points or 0.01%) isn't constant.
 The Dollar value of the capital gain for each basis-point drop in rates rises as interest rates hit lower levels. (The technical name for this is DVO1 for ""Dollar value of one basis point"". You don't need to be expert on this; it's just useful to understand the concept).
 Put differently, if interest rates drop from 7.0% to 6.5%, notes have a capital gain. If rates drop from 4.0% to 3.5%, they also have a capital gain. In both cases, the rate drop is 0.50%. But the capital gain in the second case is materially larger than in the first case.
 Right now, we're in that zone where rates are low and going lower, which means the capital gains are getting larger. That's a big win for investors on a security with almost no credit risk.
 What accounts for the rally in gold prices? There are numerous factors that affect the gold price, but certain factors dominate at certain times. Right now, the key factor is interest rates. Rates are going down at a rapid pace and gold is going up in a kind of synchronicity. Why?
 The simplest explanation for the correlation is that Treasury notes and gold are both high-quality assets that compete for investor allocations. Gold does not have a yield (although it can produce significant capital gains).
 When yields on Treasuries drop, the zero yield on gold is relatively more attractive compared with the note yield and gold prices start to rally.
 The key questions for investors are: Will rates continue to drop? And will gold continue to rally in sync with falling rates?
 To forecast rates, we have to look at economic fundamentals. (By the way, the Federal Reserve is almost irrelevant for this purpose. The Fed controls the short end of the yield curve only and has almost no impact on longer-term rates including the 10-year Treasury note rate we are considering here.)
 One conundrum of recent US economic performance is that GDP has remained robust while signs of a recession and possible a financial crisis keep accumulating.
 US GDP was 2.2% in the first quarter of 2023, 2.1% in the second quarter and a strong 4.9% in the third quarter. The best estimate for fourth-quarter growth from the Atlanta Fed is currently 1.2%, a substantial drop from the third quarter.
 If that Q4 figure holds, growth for the entire year of 2023 will come in around 2.5%. That's not too shabby, and it's slightly better than the 2.2% average annual growth from 2009-2019 in the 10-year period between the global financial crisis and the pandemic.
 In any case, it's a far cry from a recession.
 Still, a focus on full-year growth of around 2.5% ignores the trend. When growth goes from 4.9% in the third quarter to 1.2% in the fourth quarter, something extreme happened. It's almost certainly the case that consumers slammed on the brakes in October.
 Recession signs are real and growing worse. These include credit contraction, rising bad debts, increasing jobless claims, collapsing commercial real estate markets, contracting world trade, inverted yield curves and many other reliable technical indicators.
 How can the economy be headed into recession after such strong growth recently?
 The riddle is solved by the fact that the economy has been propped up by the consumer. That explains the growth. But the consumer has been on a non-sustainable path. That explains the warning signs.
 The consumer came out of the pandemic with a head of steam provided by handouts from Trump ($1800 per adult), and Biden (also about $1400 per adult) between April 2020 and March 2021. That was supplemented by $900 billion of Paycheck Protection Program loans, which were forgiven one year later.
 Student loan payments were suspended from 2020-2023. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at zero from 2020-2022. Then the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act of August 2022 handed $1 trillion of taxpayer money to Green New Scam businesses and other pet projects.
 With that money, Americans were able to pay down credit card balances and build up savings. It was a powerful double-dose of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Much of this operates with a lag so the growth momentum carried over into 2023.
 Now it's all gone. Short-term interest rates are over 5%. Mortgage rates are over 7%. Student loan repayments have started again. There are no more pandemic handouts. Americans' savings are depleted, and their credit cards are tapped out.
 Now the reckoning begins. In fact, the recession may already be here.
 Interest rates do not typically peak at the start of a recession; they peak somewhat after the recession begins. Businesses see revenues decline and turn to lines of credit to help with cash flow.
 Only later, when unemployment goes up and credit losses accumulate, do banks rein in credit and then interest rates start to decline. We may already be at that stage. The fact that interest rates are already in sharp decline suggests the recession has already begun.
 The importance of this for investors is that interest rate declines have much further to go (probably down to the level of 2% or lower over the next six months), which means gold prices have further to rise (perhaps to the $2300 per ounce level or higher).
 With both trends in place and a positive feedback loop between them, this is a once-in-a-decade opportunity for investors.
 It really doesn't get much better than that!"
2023-12-06,"Title:Depression Economics
Article:Revisiting the Great Depression with Murray Rothbard...

 SOMETIMES, albeit very occasionally, you come across a book that utterly changes the way you look at the world, writes Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 One such book: Murray Rothbard's extraordinarily thought-provoking ""America's Great Depression"" (The Ludwig von Mises Institute, Fifth Edition, 2008).
 Rothbard, who died in January 1995, was something of a 'Renaissance man': scholar, economist, historian and philosopher. He was also a leading member of what has come to be known as the Austrian school of economics – which amongst other things maintains a healthy cynicism about the value of mathematical modelling in markets, and which puts a premium on 'sound money' over more speculative and ultimately dangerous credit creation.
 Not least in its suspicion of the role of banks, it is the perfect read for our time.
 If your schooling was anything like ours, ""America's Great Depression"" will turn on its head your opinion of the economic catastrophe of the 1930s – a period whose echoes resound throughout the global financial crisis that began in 2007 and which has yet to be resolved, if the share prices of the major US banks, for example, are any guide.
 In essence, the message we received at school was that Herbert Hoover oversaw a stupendous Crash in the US stock market; the economy entered a profound slump; and it was only the interventionist vigour of President Franklin D. Roosevelt which pulled it back out.
 But Rothbard's conclusions are diametrically opposed. President Hoover, by Rothbard's account, threw all kinds of government resources at the problem, long before Roosevelt's own alphabet soup of state agencies. Rothbard's thoughts about the banking system, in particular, and about the role of government in addressing booms and busts, have enormous relevance for today's investment markets.
 Rothbard's death in 1995 meant that he was unable to share with us his views about the orgy of credit provision and the unrestrained mortgage lending that in large part triggered the global banking crisis. Let's not even mention the economic insanity that accompanied Covid, most notoriously lockdowns. But it is unlikely that he would have approved. And he had extremely strong opinions about the very nature of fractional reserve banking: the system by which banks keep a tiny fraction of their deposits in order to lend out the remainder for profit. As he comments in this masterful work:
 ""Banks are ""inherently bankrupt"" because they issue far more warehouse receipts to cash (nowadays in the form of ""deposits"" redeemable in cash on demand) than they have cash available. Hence, they are always vulnerable to bank runs. These runs are not like any other business failures, because they simply consist of depositors claiming their own rightful property, which the banks do not have. ""Inherent bankruptcy,"" then, is an essential feature of any fractional reserve banking system.""
 Rothbard goes on to quote Frank D. Graham from ""Partial Reserve Money and the 100% Proposal"" (American Economic Review, September 1936):
 ""The attempt of the banks to realize the inconsistent aims of lending cash, or merely multiplied claims to cash, and still to represent that cash is available on demand is even more preposterous than.. eating one's cake and counting on it for future consumption.. The alleged convertibility is a delusion dependent upon the right's not being unduly exercised.""
 Suffice to say that Rothbard, and members of the Austrian school, hold to the primacy of gold as a fundamental store of value that restricts the animal spirits of bankers to indulge in uncontrolled credit creation.
 As Rothbard sees it, the business cycle is straightforward. Bank credit expansion causes an inflationary boom, which is marked by an expansion in the money supply and by what he calls malinvestment, both by bankers and entrepreneurs. The crisis comes about when credit expansion halts abruptly and those malinvestments become all too evident. What he then calls the ""depression recovery"" starts the necessary adjustment process ""by which the economy returns to the most efficient ways of satisfying consumer desires.""
 Note that Rothbard conjoins ""depression"" and ""recovery"": they are one and the same thing. You cannot have economic recovery without a cleansing depression:
 ""Wasteful projects.. must either be abandoned or used as best they can be. Inefficient firms, buoyed up by the artificial boom, must be liquidated or have their debts scaled down or be turned over to their creditors. Prices of producers' goods must fall, particularly in the higher orders of production – this includes capital goods, lands, and wage rates.. Not only prices of particular machines must fall, but also the prices of whole aggregates of capital, e.g. stock market and real estate values. In fact, these values must fall more than the earnings from the assets..""
 ""Liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate."" This notorious quote from US Treasury Andrew Mellon after the Crash once struck us as grotesque, unfeeling, and overly simplistic. Now, having read Rothbard, we are not so sure. Mellon suggested that the economic severity of the depression would ""purge the rottenness out of the system.""
 This sounds like painful medicine, which of course it is. But as the scale of government support for the banking system in our own time continues to swell monstrously, one might well ask whether the presumed interventionist cure is worse than the disease. Rothbard, as a classic free marketeer, indicates that the economic contraction process causes no positive malinvestments (unlike the boom that preceded it), so it will not lead to such a painful period of depression and adjustment. ""If businessmen are misled into thinking that less capital is available for investment than is really the case, no lasting damage in the form of wasted investments will ensue.""
 Where the Rothbard thesis is most striking, however, is in relation to the role of government. His first and clearest injunction to return the economy to ""normal"" prosperity: don't interfere with the market's adjustment process;
 ""The more the government intervenes to delay the market's adjustment, the longer and more gruelling the depression will be, and the more difficult will be the road to complete recovery. Government hampering aggravates and perpetuates the depression. Yet, government depression policy has always (and would have even more today) aggravated the very evils it has loudly tried to cure.""
 Rothbard goes on to list the various ways that government might hamper this market adjustment process. Ironically, the list also and exactly constitutes the preferred ""anti-depression"" measures of government policy! The list of flawed palliatives runs as follows:

 Prevent or delay liquidation. Lend money to shaky businesses, call on banks to lend further, etc.
 Inflate further. Further inflation blocks the necessary fall in prices, thus delaying adjustment and prolonging depression.
 Keep wage rates up. Artificial maintenance of wage rates in a depression ensures permanent mass unemployment.
 Keep prices up. Keeping prices above their free market levels will create unsaleable surpluses, and prevent a return to prosperity.
 Stimulate consumption and discourage saving. Any increase in the relative size of government in the economy shifts the societal consumption-investment ratio in favour of consumption, and prolongs the depression.
 Subsidize unemployment. Any subsidisation of unemployment will prolong unemployment indefinitely, and delay the shift of workers to the fields where jobs are available.

What is striking today is how many of these measures are being actively pursued by the governments of developed economies, not least our own.
 Rothbard concludes his study of the Great Depression by pointing out just how extensive the Hoover administration measures were in an ultimately vain attempt to combat the slump.
 ""For the first time, laissez-faire was boldly thrown overboard and every governmental weapon thrown into the breach.. By every ""progressive"" tenet of our day, he should have ended his term a conquering hero; instead he left America in utter and complete ruin – a ruin unprecedented in length and intensity.""
 Why did this come about? Rothbard holds, perhaps controversially, that only governmental inflation can generate a true boom and bust cycle, and that any depression will be prolonged and intensified by inflationist intervention on the part of presumably well-meaning politicians. ""America's Great Depression"" showcases Rothbard's firm belief that President Hoover's aggressive interventionist measures ended up aggravating the economic slowdown. In his words,
 ""The guilt for the Great Depression must, at long last, be lifted from the shoulders of the free-market economy, and placed where it properly belongs: at the doors of politicians, bureaucrats and the mass of ""enlightened"" economists. And in any other depression, past or future, the story will be the same.""
 Governments and their central banks, in other words, are the primary causes of recessions and depressions – and of wild inflations. Unsound fiat must ultimately be replaced by sound money. The prices of gold and silver would now appear to be reaching exactly the same conclusion."
2023-12-05,"Title:Profit Taking in Gold Slows at Record-High Prices
Article:Still fewest gold buyers in 4 years, 13 for silver...


              
           


RECORD-HIGH gold prices have seen private investors as a group sell more of the precious metal than they're buying yet again, 
            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault.


              
           

             But unlike in silver – where the recent jump in prices spurred heavier selling among existing investors – the pace of profit taking in gold has slowed as financial and geopolitical risks continue to build ahead of New Year 2024.
           

              
           

             Indeed, with gold prices setting new all-time records as cash in the bank offers the highest rate of interest since before the 2008 financial crash, the real surprise in physical bullion is that profit-taking hasn't been greater.
           

              
           

             Gold selling remains marginal compared with the buy-and-hold approach adopted by the vast majority of private investors. That strategy, coupled with record-heavy central bank gold demand led by China, suggests that the rising floor beneath gold prices continues to strengthen as investors look ahead to 2024 and see a growing risk of recession, ongoing war in Ukraine if not worsening conflict in the Middle East, plus divisive elections in the US, India and the UK.
           

              
           

             Even so, November saw the number of people buying gold on BullionVault drop 15.6% from October's rebound to hit a fresh 4-year low as the price rose $40 per Troy ounce to finish at a new month-end high of $2035.
           

              
           

             The number of sellers fell harder than buyers however, down 36.8% from October's 7-month high. Together that pulled the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of investor behaviour in the gold bullion market – up to 51.9.
           

              
           




              
           

             Any reading above 50.0 indicates more buyers and sellers. The 
            Gold Investor Index set a decade low of 49.1 in June 2019 as the precious metal's price jumped at what was then the fastest pace in over 3 years, and it 
            set a decade high of 65.9 as the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020.
           

              
           

             Compared to that peak, the latest reading is clearly weak. More dramatically, last month's rise of just 1.1 points from October's 9-month low was the index's strongest increase since June, and the fourth strongest of the last 12 months.
           

              
           

             A gold rush this ain't, in other words. And 
            the SVB mini-crisis aside, it hasn't been all year. And while November saw investor selling in gold ease back despite the price rising further, this Monday's big price spike proved it's too early to say that profit-taking is close to exhausted.
           

              
           

             Because BullionVault is open 24/7, unlike coin shops or stock market-listed gold ETF products, yesterday morning's 
            3.5% surge in gold prices at the start of Asian trade saw sellers jump to take advantage, outnumbering buyers and with the quantity sold outweighing demand by almost three-quarters.
           

              
           

             That extended the pattern of the last 3 months – the longest such stretch since mid-2019 – with BullionVault users selling a quarter-tonne of gold more than they bought as a group across November.
           

              
           

             But note: That was barely half the quantity of 
            net gold selling in October, and while last month's liquidation took total client holdings down 2.1% from end-August's record high to the smallest in 20 months at 47.2 tonnes, it still saw the value of BullionVault users' gold rise 1.4% to a new record Dollar value of $3.1 billion.
           

              
           

             Silver in contrast saw profit-taking accelerate in November as the Dollar price jumped by 7.8%, reaching the heaviest since April. BullionVault users sold 14.5 tonnes more than they bought as a group, cutting their total holdings by 1.1% to 1,229.1 tonnes, the smallest in 19 months and 3.0% below the record high of October 2022.
           

              
           

             But here again, as in gold, the value of those silver holdings still grew, rising 6.6% across November to $988 million, the highest in 7 months.
           

              
           




              
           

             By number, however, silver's big price jump in November – putting it above $25 per Troy ounce at the end of the month for the first time since July 2021 – really whacked the balance of buyers and sellers.
           

              
           

             The number of investors choosing to buy the precious metal fell 45.9% from October, sinking to the fewest since August 2010.
           

              
           

             The number of silver sellers in contrast jumped by 57.3% to the most in 7 months. Together that pulled the Silver Investor Index down by 5.2 points, the steepest drop since October 2020, and it put the index at a new series low of 46.4.
           

              
           

             Bottom line? Whether fast, high or both, rising prices for gold and silver continue to meet profit-taking rather than any kind of rush to buy. But that selling remains marginal, and across November it lagged the rise in prices, putting BullionVault users' total precious metals holdings at a new all-time high of $4.1 billion.
           

              
           

             So it pays to take profit, short term. But it also keeps paying to buy and hold, too."

             Cheap money would of course prove wonderful for bonds, stocks, real estate speculators, no doubt crypto bros and (most likely) precious metals led by gold and silver.
           

              
           

             So how much lower will US rates go? That's where opinion splits.
           

              
           




              
           

             US investment bank Goldman Sachs is the least excited about Fed rate cuts for 2024, predicting only 1 small cut before the end of next year.
           

              
           

             That's because Goldman believes that, while ""the hard part of the inflation fight now looks over"", the US central bank has ""made substantial progress toward a soft landing...""
           

              
           

             ...and so it 
            sees little chance of an economic recession, caused by the Fed's rate hikes, needing a steep cut to rates next year.
           

              
           

             At the other end of the range, Swiss-based bank UBS says that Fed rates will end 2024 way down at 2.75%, pretty much halving from where they stand today.
           

              
           

             Their logic?
           

              
           

             ""The starting conditions are much worse now than 12 months ago,"" UBS is quoted by CNBC, pointing to the ""historically large amount of credit that is being withdrawn from the US economy"" as lenders stop lending so much and the Fed itself continues to wind down its massive QE bond purchases from the Covid pandemic and, before that, the global financial crisis.
           

              
           

             On an annual basis, the Fed has now 
            shrunk its balance-sheet by almost 10% from November 2022, very nearly matching the record pace of sucking money out of banks it hit in summer 2019, back when it last lost its bottle and stopped reducing its QE bond holdings as the financial markets 
            decided that a US recession was looming.
           

              
           

             The markets proved right of course, but more out of luck than foresight. I mean, no-one said in 2019 that a global pandemic would shut the world economy in 2020.
           

              
           

             That recession then marked the 
            deepest plunge in economic activity on modern records. And yet the US Fed, in response, slashed its key interest rate by only 2.3 percentage points, less than UBS is now forecasting for 2024.
           

              
           




              
           

             Does anyone really think next year will be worse than Covid?
           

              
           

             No, at a guess (and a prayer). But it doesn't need to be.
           

              
           

             The Fed could easily cut rates deeper and faster next year than it did from 2019 to 2020, because it's starting from a much higher point.
           

              
           

             Check the chart above. It shows, in blue, how the Fed Funds rate is currently at its highest since early 2001, way up at 5.33% per annum. Whereas in 2019, and after trying to ""normalize"" interest rates following the global financial crisis, the Fed's baby-step rate rises only got up to 2.40% before it began cutting rates again.
           

              
           

             The Fed then refused to go below zero (unlike the Bank of Japan or Swiss National Bank or European Central Bank). So the most it could cut by when the 2019 recession scare became the 2020 Covid catastrophe was also 2.40%.
           

              
           

             This contrasts with the Tech Stock Crash of 2001, when Fed rates started at 6.50% and fell by 4.60% in 12 months...
           

              
           

             ...and it also contrasts with the panic phase of the global financial crisis in 2008, when Fed rates started at 5.26% and fell by 4.10% in 12 months.
           

              
           

             Put another way, the recession forecast from UBS looks a lot more like the ""soft landing"" forecast from Goldman Sachs than the gap between their interest-rate forecasts would suggest at first glance.
           

              
           

             Indeed, and putting the 2020 Covid recession aside (because the Fed's rate-cutting was limited by its low starting point and its very Anglo-Saxon commitment to the 'zero lower bound') only 1 of the previous 7 recessions in the US saw the Fed cut rates by less than UBS' forecast for 2024.
           

              
           

             That shallow cut to Fed rates came around the 1980 recession, brought about by the Fed yanking rates up above double-digits as it finally grasped the nettle of tackling double-digit inflation.
           

              
           

             ""Letting gold go to $850 per ounce was a mistake,"" said famously tall and infamously high-rate Fed chair Paul Volcker of 
            that frantic time, when gold peaked 24 times above its price of a decade earlier.
           

              
           

             ""We had to deal with inflation. There was a kind of great speculative pressure...Everybody wanted to buy collectibles...Other markets of real things were booming.""
           

              
           

             Lots of things are now booming again as everyone bets that Jerome Powell, head of the Fed today, will start cutting rates next June if not May if not April or March.
           

              
           

             Investors and speculators have already bid up the Nasdaq 100 index of US tech stocks by more than 12% since the eve of the Fed's ""no change"" decision at the start of November. They've sent silver prices over 12% higher against the falling US Dollar over the last 2 weeks alone.
           

              
           




              
           

             For now, that jump in silver prices hasn't been followed by gold (now a mere 5.2% higher from a fortnight ago)...
           

              
           

             ...let alone by gold-mining stocks...
           

              
           

             ...and it's so far spurred a return to 
            the kind of profit-taking by existing silver investors seen 
            at the tail-end of 2022.
           

              
           

             But Powell has, in the past, been called a ""high rates guy""...
           

              
           

             ...albeit by Donald Trump, the deeply indebted real-estate mogul, who chose Powell to chair the Fed back in 2018 when he was in the White House and 
            he wanted ""a low rates guy"" to keep juicing the economy and the stock market.
           

              
           

             Most surely, Jerome Powell – at least compared to the rate of interest set by his more recent predecessors – really does seem to like keeping rates closer to inflation if not above it.
           

              
           

             That resolve may well get tested next year if this month's gently weakening US data starts to tumble. So too might America's financial support for the wars being fought by both Ukraine and Israel, never mind Taiwan if Beijing decides to chance its luck...
           

              
           

             ...as well as Washington's own 
            record peace-time budget deficits and its startling ability to keep the stock-market soaring...
           

              
           

             ...even before we get to the possibility of Trump himself returning to the White House in next November's election.
           

              
           

             Long-dated Treasury bonds, after all, are now 
            deemed a ""risky"" asset (a little 
            too late to help unwary savers!) while 40% of small-cap US companies 
            are now loss-making.
           

              
           

             All of this will matter to gold, silver and the other precious metals next year.
           

              
           

             Bottom line for now? There ain't 
            no crisis like a Dollar crisis. And the Dollar faces a whole raft of trouble ahead.
           

              
           

             More on this to follow. Lots more no doubt in 2024."
2023-11-29,"Title:Copper, Gold and the Looming US Deflation
Article:Ratio says disinflation flipping to recession...


              
           


I HAVE NOT posted the monthly chart of the Copper/Gold ratio probably since last year, 
            says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.


              
           

             That's because 2023 has been all about disinflationary Goldilocks recovery, rather than a deflationary liquidity crisis.
           

              
           

             However, as Goldilocks matures into old age, it is worth keeping tabs on the original thesis, which is Inflation > Disinflationary Goldilocks > Deflation scare/liquidity crisis.
           

              
           

             I realize that everybody now knows that a recession is coming, which would argue against one coming any time soon. But the chart is the chart and it has been the chart for about 18 months.
           

              
           

             The chart, in this case, is a gauge of a counter-cyclical environment, and though the stock market has rallied on cue in 2023, and commodities – with the help of OPEC+ oil price manipulation – have rallied to a lesser degree, the counter-cyclical signal is not only still in place, it has become more pronounced.
           

              
           




              
           

             To many inflationists, commodity super-cyclers and supposed ""metals"" experts, there is little difference between the macro characteristics of gold and copper, because to understand and manage the differences requires difficult as opposed to easy to understand (by the herd) analysis.
           

              
           

             But aside from illustrating the clownery of Copper/Commodity promoters who've remained steadfast bullish the whole while, the signal is right in line with the 2023 Goldilocks 'disinflation' view and it is burrowing southward looking ahead to the next link in our chain, deflation and/or liquidity crisis.
           

              
           

             In the event this analysis expires in favor of an inflationary option sooner than currently expected, the Copper/Gold ratio (along with other indicators we use in NFTRH) should give a signal well ahead of time.
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, regardless of whether the stock market's Goldilocks flavored rally continues on to test or even marginally exceed the 2021 high, the negative signal by Copper/Gold is intact and waiting."
2023-11-29,"Title:Clueless Investing vs. the Internet
Article:Everything changed yet banks remain, like 'growth' investing...


              
           


THERE's an (inadvertently) hilarious sequence in the BBC's 2019 drama 'Mother Father Son', 
            writes Tim Price at Price Value Partners.


              
           

             Supporters of Prime Minister Jahan (Danny Sapani) are seen angrily striding into a conference brandishing copies of the newspaper owned by Max Finch (Richard Gere) – primarily so they can tear up those same newspapers after it's revealed that Finch's media empire is backing another candidate.
           

              
           

             The idea that large groups of people these days even read print newspapers, let alone care about what's in them, is simply quaint. The latest ABC data for newspaper readerships makes for pretty grim reading.
           

              
           

             The only way the BBC could have topped this for unwitting irony would have been if it had shown establishing shots of large numbers of people switching on the BBC News – as opposed to switching it off. Has a national broadcaster ever fallen out of favour with its core audience more comprehensively?
           

              
           

             Three sectors in particular are struggling for sheer survival amidst surging digital headwinds: traditional media including newspapers and broadcast TV, High Street retailers, and textile manufacturers (wherever labour is a core component, industrial players tend to shop around for the lowest cost providers, and their capital is highly mobile).
           

              
           

             Perhaps US Inc. will also come to regret having offshored so much of its manufacturing to China. And when it comes to stock and sector selection, after an effortless decade of outperformance by growth, investor 'style bias' is about to matter hugely again.
           

              
           

             And of course all of this was foreseeable, pretty much from the birth of the worldwide web itself. Although this correspondent first started using a web browser in 1996 when working for Merrill Lynch, the world-changing potential of The Internet didn't really sink in until we came across something called 'The Cluetrain Manifesto' in late 1999.
           

              
           

             'The Cluetrain Manifesto' is a modern-day reworking of Martin Luther's 95 Theses – the propositions and complaints allegedly nailed to the door of Wittenberg Cathedral that sparked the Reformation.
           

              
           

             Among the Cluetrain propositions:
           

 Markets are conversations.
 Markets consist of human beings, not demographic sectors.
 The Internet is enabling conversations among human beings that were simply not possible in the era of mass media.
 Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy.
 In both internetworked markets and among intranetworked employees, people are speaking to each other in a powerful new way.
 These networked conversations are enabling powerful new forms of social organization and knowledge exchange to emerge.
 As a result, markets are getting smarter, more informed, more organized.
 Participation in a networked market changes people fundamentally.
 What's happening to markets is also happening among employees. A metaphysical construct called 'The Company' is the only thing standing between the two.
 Companies can now communicate with their markets directly. If they blow it, it could be their last chance.
 Brand loyalty is the corporate version of going steady, but the breakup is inevitable – and coming fast. Because they are networked, smart markets are able to renegotiate relationships with blinding speed.
 Networked markets can change suppliers overnight. Networked knowledge workers can change employers over lunch. Your own ""downsizing initiatives"" taught us to ask the question: ""Loyalty? What's that?""
 Today, the org chart is hyperlinked, not hierarchical. Respect for hands-on knowledge wins over respect for abstract authority.
 We want you to take 50 million of us as seriously as you take one reporter from The Wall Street Journal.
 To traditional corporations, networked conversations may appear confused, may sound confusing. But we are organizing faster than they are. We have better tools, more new ideas, no rules to slow us down.
 We are waking up and linking to each other. We are watching. But we are not waiting.


             The founders of Cluetrain – Messrs Levine, Locke, Searls and Weinberger – were among the first to ""get"" how the Internet really would change business as usual.
           

              
           

             Impressed by what we read online, we went off and bought the book. Impressed by that, we jacked in our job at Merrill Lynch and entered the digital economy instead. Our career path changed, in a way that we have no regrets about whatever. Indirectly, it led us to where we are today, as partner in our own company, and to financial freedom we would probably never have achieved as just another employee of a Wall Street firm.
           

              
           

             Admittedly, from the vantage point of 2023, some of Cluetrain's philosophy comes across as uncontrollably free-spirited, not to say hippyish ('The Wall Street Journal' called it ""the pretentious, strident and absolutely brilliant creation of four marketing gurus who have renounced marketing-as-usual""), but Cluetrain always struck us as a new economy battle cry years ahead of its time.
           

              
           

             We are living through the end of business-as-usual; the internet really does change everything. But these guys were saying it over 20 years ago, when profits or even revenues were beyond most web businesses altogether.
           

              
           

             As for us, back in 1999, as both an employee and a stockholder of Merrill Lynch, this correspondent had begun to notice the ground shifting beneath his feet. We had not ignored the fact that the full-service investment bank Merrill Lynch – with its army of 13,000 domestic brokers – had just seen its market capitalisation eclipsed by that of online discount brokerage Charles Schwab.
           

              
           

             In any event, we didn't need to be told the message of 'Cluetrain' twice. By April 2000 we had left Merrill Lynch and set up our own business.
           

              
           

             Others at the firm reacted differently; that is to say, with denial. John 'Launny' Steffens, the vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch, warned in September 1998 that:
           

              
           

             ""The do-it-yourself model of investing, centred on Internet trading, should be regarded as a serious threat to Americans' financial lives.""
           

              
           

             But then he would, wouldn't he?
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, the web and networked markets went on to dismantle or reinvent traditional businesses across the economic landscape. The music industry was an early scalp. Napster may not have won, but Big Music largely lost, and had to change.
           

              
           

             Who would have thought in 1999 that a pure technology company – Apple – would end up being the dominant seller of music in the early years of the 21st Century?
           

              
           

             First music, than traditional publishing. Any business whose end product was at the mercy of digitisation was vulnerable to the digital economy. Newspapers buckled under the threat from blogs, aggregators and Google; booksellers and then all kinds of other retailers got crushed by the Leviathan that is Amazon.
           

              
           

             Finance is now set grimly against the gale. There's a quotation that's attributed to Bill Gates of Microsoft back in 1994:
           

              
           

             ""Banking is necessary, but banks are not.""
           

              
           

             Just pause to consider that.
           

              
           

             And then, around the turn of the millennium, Josef Ackermann, the CEO of Deutsche Bank, one of the largest banks in Europe but now a basket case, commented that what he feared most was not his traditional competitors, but rather the rise of ""near-banks and non-banks"".
           

              
           

             It took a little time, but those fears are already coming to pass. Suffice to say, the authors of the Cluetrain Manifesto got there first. They wrote of a new economic paradigm, in which gigantic businesses scanned the horizon in search of competitors who looked like they did.
           

              
           

             There was just one problem.
           

              
           

             Those businesses were utterly unaware of the legions of ant-like start-ups who were swarming at their feet, looking nothing like them, and content to compete for a tiny fraction of the giants' business. Although each of them individually might not amount to much by way of competition, some of them might become huge, and collectively they would quite possibly sweep the old line players away.
           

              
           

             Speaking of style bias, the US fund management firm Research Affiliates crunched the numbers on the entire US stock market for the 50 years from 1967 to 2016 by investment style and the results are shown below.
           

              
           




              
           

             We can debate the specific characteristics of 'value', 'momentum', 'quality' and 'growth' stocks, but in essence they would look something like this:
           

 Value stocks will typically trade on low valuation multiples (like price/earnings and price/book);
 Momentum stocks will typically be trending strongly higher in price, irrespective of which sector they belong to;
 Quality stocks will have robust and well recognised businesses and brands with global reach, with a history of strong and uninterrupted dividends;
 Growth stocks will be displaying strong growth in revenues (if not necessarily profits or dividends) and will often be in the technology sector.


             The intriguing thing about the Research Affiliates data is that it pointed to some surprising conclusions, namely that on average, only 'value' and 'momentum' generated superior returns relative to the market over the longer term; 'quality' and 'growth' actually tended to destroy value relative to the market as a whole.
           

              
           

             We stress that these style labels are not beneficiaries of an exact science. It may also be the case that the history of the last decade or so – and the extraordinary outperformance of 'growth' over that period, especially relative to 'value' – might simply be a huge albeit persistent anomaly.
           

              
           

             Or perhaps things really are different now. As somebody once said: value investors invest on the basis that nothing will change; whereas growth investors invest on the basis that everything will change. The reality surely lies somewhere between these two extremes.
           

              
           

             But as inflation looks increasingly engrained and interest rates and bond yields have already surged from their 5,000-year lows, we're not about to abandon value now. Nor our commitment to precious metals and other real assets, for increasingly obvious, not to say existential, reasons."

POLITICAL outsider Javier Milei won Argentina's presidential election last week, in a development that's shocked the world, 
            says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             Though his policy prescriptions are different than Trump's in many respects, Milei is basically the Argentinian version of Donald Trump because of his anti-establishment, ""drain the swamp"" rhetoric.
           

              
           

             You can liken Milei's election to Trump's 2016 election and Brexit. It's a popular rejection of globalism and the neoliberal global order.
           

              
           

             Perhaps not coincidentally, Argentina joined the BRICS nations in August, which will formally take effect in January.
           

              
           

             As I've written about extensively, the BRICS nations are challenging Dollar hegemony and the Western-dominated global financial system.
           

              
           

             Milei has identified as an ""anarcho-capitalist"", which is essentially free market libertarianism taken to the extreme. That means the elimination of the state and privatization of all the state's functions.
           

              
           

             It's about as anti-establishment as you can get.
           

              
           

             Needless to say, he wants to eliminate Argentina's version of the Fed. I wish him luck. He'll need it. Let's just say he faces an uphill battle, like Trump did after he was elected in 2016.
           

              
           

             That someone who identifies as an anarcho-capitalist can win an election in Argentina is remarkable in itself (Milei won in a 56%-44% landslide).
           

              
           

             Since the middle of the 20th century, Argentina has been governed largely by left-wing politics. It's not exactly fertile soil for extreme libertarianism.
           

              
           

             But when your country's suffering economically and your annualized inflation rate is approaching 150%, you might want to throw the bums out and try something different.
           

              
           

             By the way, most people might not realize it but Argentina was once a very wealthy nation. In fact, there was a saying that if someone was very wealthy, he was ""as rich as an Argentine.""
           

              
           

             That phrase is obviously long out of date."
2023-11-27,"Title:Buffett's Inflation-Investment Warning
Article:Aka, beware the men in the white coats...


              
           


SOME investment truths are eternal, 
            says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.


              
           

             Here's one from Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history:
           

              
           

             ""It is no longer a secret that stocks, like bonds, do poorly in an inflationary environment.""
           

              
           

             Buffett wrote that in an essay from May 1977 cited above, 'How inflation swindles the equity investor'.
           

              
           

             History is about to repeat.
           

              
           

             After a more than decade-long bull run for the US stock market, mega-cap 'growth' stocks might seem invulnerable. The consensus is that they are the only game in town. There's a superficial logic to the equity story which rests heavily if not exclusively on recency bias. But it critically ignores one gigantic elephant in the room: the future path of interest rates.
           

              
           

             There is a clear warning from history. On 31 December, 1964, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 874. On 31 December, 1981, it was 875. In Buffett's words,
           

              
           

             ""I'm known as a long term investor and a patient guy, but that is not my idea of a big move.""
           

              
           

             In that 17-year period, the GDP of the US rose by 370% and Fortune 500 company sales went up by a factor of six times. More than an entire decade for the US stock market was lost.
           

              
           

             Why? Back to Buffett, again.
           

              
           

             ""To understand why that happened, we need first to look at one of the two important variables that affect investment results: interest rates.
           

              
           

             ""These act on financial valuations the way gravity acts on matter: the higher the rate, the greater the downward pull. That's because the rates of return that investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the risk-free rate that they can earn from government securities.
           

              
           

             ""So if the government rate rises, the prices of all other investments must adjust downward, to a level that brings their expected rates of return into line...
           

              
           

             ""There...lies the major explanation of why tremendous growth in the economy was accompanied by a stock market going nowhere.""
           

              
           

             In one of his recent 'Year in Review' essays, Cornell chemistry professor and economic agent provocateur David Collum reminds us that:
           

              
           

             ""Optimists bray that rising rates are bullish, a sign that the world economy is recovering. In 1999, however, Buffett wrote a compelling article in Fortune attributing secular equity moves to one and only one parameter – the direction of long-term interest rates. Secular equity bull markets occur when long-term rates are dropping – not low but dropping – and secular bears occur when rates are rising. He didn't equivocate...
           

              
           

             ""So are rates really that low? In a word, yes...The salad days of the bond market are in our rear-view mirror. The rate bottom and subsequent rise will be global. Rising rates will spread into the markets and economy at large, causing concurrent stagnation, dropping price earnings ratios (from nosebleed Case-Shiller estimates of 24), collapse of credit-fuelled/capex-lite corporate profit margins, and crush under-funded pensions and municipalities rendering them less funded. If rates have nowhere to go but up, what direction are they headed?""
           

              
           

             As we now know, the tide is going out for a trend that has supported higher bond prices for 40+ years.
           

              
           

             There's another reason we think it's time to be cautious on the last decade's secular 'growth' winners. Call it, if you like, 'too much belief in authority'. Check out Craig Zobel's 2012 thriller, 'Compliance'. It makes for uncomfortable viewing. In the film, based on real events, a fast food restaurant receives a call from someone claiming to be a police officer. The manager is informed that a female staff member has stolen money from a customer's purse and must be detained.
           

              
           

             Despite denying the crime the employee, a young girl, is held by her colleagues in the backroom. She protests her innocence to no avail. On the basis that she might be hiding the evidence, the ""police officer"" then instructs the manager to carry out a strip search. The film plays out as she and her gullible staff are manipulated by the caller through their desire to ""help the police"". In the end, the employees realise that they have been tricked into committing crimes themselves.
           

              
           

             These are clearly actors playing their respective roles. But although the premise itself sounds ludicrous, it is convincingly staged. In fact, the events depicted in 'Compliance' are not purely fictitious...instead they're based on 70 similar incidents that took place across North America.
           

              
           

             The film's message is that many of us automatically and even unthinkingly surrender to authority. It's not malice that makes the (innocent) girl's co-workers humiliate her. They do it because they think they're following the legitimate orders of a police officer. As to why that officer can't come to the restaurant: let's just say he is very persuasive.
           

              
           

             It was the poet Coleridge who coined the phrase ""the willing suspension of disbelief"". If an artist can infuse his work with enough humanity – and the appearance of truth – we, the audience, will buy into the illusion. We'll put our scepticism on hold.
           

              
           

             That is the power of authority. We can't help but draw parallels with the investment world...where the most successful players never cease to question the received wisdom.
           

              
           

             'Compliance' follows two even more notorious US experiments in human psychology that are grimly relevant in our post-Covid dystopia.
           

              
           

             The Stanford Prison Experiment took place at Stanford University, California, in August 1971. 24 male students were assigned roles as either prisoner or guard in a mock prison in the basement of the university's psychology department.
           

              
           

             Psychology professor Philip Zimbardo was setting out to test the hypothesis that the main cause of abuse in prisons was the psychological make-up of the prisoners and their wardens. The 'guards' were equipped with wooden batons and mirrored sunglasses to prevent direct eye contact. The 'prisoners' were arrested at their homes, fingerprinted, then had their mug shots taken.
           

              
           

             Order lasted for precisely one day. On day two, prisoners in one cell blockaded the door and refused to follow the guards' instructions.
           

              
           

             Then after 36 hours, one prisoner started to ""act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control."" When the experimenters realised he wasn't acting, he was released.
           

              
           

             Guards soon resorted to physical punishment. Sanitary conditions quickly deteriorated too, with guards refusing to allow prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but a bucket in their cell. Some prisoners had their mattresses removed; others were stripped naked as punishment.
           

              
           

             The experiment then spiralled into more abuse, hunger strikes, and solitary confinement. After just six days, it was abandoned. One third of the guards were determined to have displayed ""genuine sadistic tendencies"". Many of the prisoners were traumatised.
           

              
           

             Such is the malign power of authority.
           

              
           

             Equally notorious was the series of experiments run by Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram in 1961. You may have seen video footage of the original Milgram tests, or recreations of them. Each involved three participants. Two of them – the one coordinating the experiment, and the so-called 'learner', were ""in"" on the experiment. The third, the supposed 'teacher', was the unwitting subject of it.
           

              
           

             So, the teacher began by reading a list of word pairs to the learner. Then they would read the first word of each pair again, and four possible ways to complete it. The learner would press a button to indicate his response.
           

              
           

             If the answer was incorrect, the teacher would be instructed to deliver an electric shock to the learner. Each wrong answer increased the voltage by 15 volts. (Incidentally, in one version of the experiment, the learner would mention to the teacher that he or she suffered from a heart condition.)
           

              
           

             The 'teacher' participants believed the shocks were real. They weren't. The 'learners' were all actors, the electric shocks faked. But that didn't stop 65 per cent of the participants in Milgram's first experiment administering the final massive 450-volt dose. Every time any teacher was hesitant to continue delivering (and enhancing) the shocks, he was told by the experimenter:
           

              
           

             Please continue.
           

             The experiment requires that you continue.
           

             It is absolutely essential that you continue.
           

             You have no other choice, you must go on.
           

              
           

             If a teacher still wanted to stop after receiving all of these verbal cues, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted only after the learner had received the maximum 450-volt shock three times in a row.
           

              
           

             Milgram's experiment started three months after the trial of the German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann began in Jerusalem. Milgram set out to answer the question: could it be that Eichmann, and those like him, were simply ""obeying orders""?
           

              
           

             In the Milgram experiment, the bogeyman authority figure was not a senior army officer. It was just a man in a white coat...armed only with a clipboard.
           

              
           

             Summarising his experiment, Milgram wrote:
           

              
           

             ""I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist.
           

              
           

             ""Stark authority was pitted against the subjects' strongest moral imperatives against hurting others, and, with the subjects' ears ringing with the screams of the victims, authority won more often than not.
           

              
           

             ""The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation.
           

              
           

             ""Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process"".
           

              
           

             Milgram's results are hardly unique. His study found an average compliance level to the maximum voltage (450 volts) of 62.5%. Another study in the US then found 85% compliance, matched in Germany, beaten in Spain and Holland, with studies in the UK showing 50%, Australia 40%, Austria 80%.
           

              
           

             University ethics boards (rightly) outlawed Milgram-style experiments in the late 1980s, so no other modern studies are available. But what does all this mean for investment?
           

              
           

             For Craig Zobel in 'Compliance', authority was an unseen policeman. For Philip Zimbardo at Stanford, authority was a prison guard. For Stanley Milgram, authority was a man in a white coat.
           

              
           

             For us, 'authority' is the US Federal Reserve. In fact, it's any central banker. And they are all just as susceptible to the corruption of power as the participants in the studies listed above. The individuals working at central banks are possibly normal and well-intentioned. But they operate within a perverse system, which does the world a great deal of damage.
           

              
           

             Western central banks are dangerous for a number of reasons.
           

              
           

Quantitative easing


             The QE programmes they have pushed so aggressively have distorted relative prices across all asset types. They have only delayed the inevitable deleveraging.
           

              
           

Artificially low rates


             Having driven policy rates down to zero, they have forced investors to chase yield. That means exposing themselves to higher degrees of risk than they might have otherwise. That's because cash deposits were until recently eliminated as a viable investment choice.
           

              
           

Kicking the can down the road


             In pumping up the money supply (and their balance sheets), they have set the scene for a potentially dangerous inflationary mess further down the line. If not now.
           

              
           

A false sense of security


             Many investors accept that the central banks know what they are doing. Even that ""they have everyone's back"", or what used to be known as the ""Greenspan put"" – supporting equity markets – is alive and well.
           

              
           

             In the markets, there's a simple rule of thumb: don't fight the Fed.
           

              
           

             Given its almost unlimited monetary firepower, it has never made sense to bet against Fed policy. But that was before the Fed and its international peers went ""all-in"" with quantitative easing. Now the West's central bankers have an existential problem: their influence over markets only works while investors believe that that influence still holds.
           

              
           

             Be wary of rising interest rates. Short term monetary policy rates can theoretically stay anchored in both the US and the UK and in Europe. But neither the Fed nor the Bank of England nor the ECB can definitively prevent yields from rising in longer-dated government debt markets. And if even higher bond yields do manifest, equity markets are unlikely to be immune to them.
           

              
           

             Is there a risk, then, that the ""ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process"".

Article:Being a fool doesn't make you a crook...


              
           


DUE to professional obligations we take aboard an overplus of daily 'information' 
            says Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             Some of it – perhaps more than some of it – sorts into the 'conspiratorial' category.
           

              
           

             For example: the theory that space lasers set Maui on fire.
           

              
           

             For example: the theory that the Rothschilds ordered Kennedy shot dead.
           

              
           

             For example: the theory that the Twin Towers were knocked down not by shanghaied airplanes but by pre-planted explosives.
           

              
           

             Examples multiply and multiply.
           

              
           

             Some have even accused this very publication – if you can believe it – of merchanting conspiracy theories.
           

              
           

             These accusations have their origins in the pandemic.
           

              
           

             We had expressed...skepticism...about certain government claims and conduct.
           

              
           

             These concerned lockdowns, vaccines and the near-absolute suppression of unofficial information.
           

              
           

             Thus the ""conspiracy theorist"" label came issuing.
           

              
           

             Were we mistaken? Were we merely shouting wolf?
           

              
           

             Or have subsequent discoveries validated our doubting Thomas skepticisms?
           

              
           

             We leave that decision to you...our reader.
           

              
           

             Are certain conspiracy theories preposterous, debunkable and absurd?
           

              
           

             We believe many are preposterous, debunkable and absurd.
           

              
           

             For example, the theory that space lasers set Maui on fire.
           

              
           

             Many others file into this category.
           

              
           

             Yet if a fellow believes it, is he not free to believe it – and to preach it?
           

              
           

             Is a fool a criminal? He is not.
           

              
           

             And do you not enjoy the right to hear him yourself? Who would deny you the belly laugh his babblings would give you?
           

              
           

             Who indeed?
           

              
           

             Besides: If what he says is horrifically toxic, take it outside.
           

              
           

             Let the sunlight disinfect it. Keep it dark and the thing fester and festers... spreading like mushrooms in a dank cave.
           

              
           

             To expose it is to kill it.
           

              
           

             Today we rise in defense of the conspiracy theorist – of the man with his tinfoil crown.
           

              
           

             That is because he is a suspicious fellow.
           

              
           

             A suspicious man is an alert man. And an alert man is a superior citizen.
           

              
           

             Did not Jefferson – Mr.Thomas Jefferson – argue that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty?
           

              
           

             He may have said it and he may not have said it.
           

              
           

             But if he did not say it someone else did say it.
           

              
           

             And whoever said it was a very wise fellow.
           

              
           

             The free society must remain perpetually upon its toes. It must remain alert to threats that menace its liberties.
           

              
           

             And who is more alert to threats than the conspiracy theorist? Who spends more time upon his toes?
           

              
           

             The answer is no one.
           

              
           

             So the conspiracy theorist hallucinates. So he chases phantoms. So he connects dots that are not in fact connected.
           

              
           

             So he is – in many instances – lunatic.
           

              
           

             It is no concern. For he offers society an incomparable contribution.
           

              
           

             His incomparable contribution to society is his suspicion. In particular, his suspicion of government.
           

              
           

             Only a suspicious and distrustful people will keep an eye on their government – and if necessary, get their hands on its government.
           

              
           

             If the people take their eye off their government their government will soon have its hands on the people.
           

              
           

             That is precisely why the conspiracy theorist presents enormous value.
           

              
           

             His eyes are perpetually glued to government.
           

              
           

             They are not glued to his smartphone.
           

              
           

             As the great Mencken observed:
           

              
           

             ""All government, of course, is against liberty...
           

              
           

             ""It is the invariable habit of bureaucracies, at all times and everywhere, to assume...that every citizen is a criminal. Their one apparent purpose, pursued with a relentless and furious diligence, is to convert the assumption into a fact. They hunt endlessly for proofs, and, when proofs are lacking, for mere suspicions...
           

              
           

             ""The natural tendency of every government is to grow steadily worse – that is, to grow more satisfactory to those who constitute it and less satisfactory to those who support it...
           

              
           

             ""Government is actually the worst failure of civilized man. There has never been a really good one, and even those that are most tolerable are arbitrary, criminal, grasping and unintelligent.""
           

              
           

             This is a thing to be constantly and eternally watched.
           

              
           

             Cede it its proverbial inch and it will take its literal mile.
           

              
           

             Against this tremendous rascal the conspiracy theorist is arrayed. Against this tremendous rascal the sound citizen is arrayed.
           

              
           

             May the Lord bless them for it.
           

              
           

             Is government – at times – innocent of the roguery and criminality its watchers suspect?
           

              
           

             Perhaps at times it is. It may not always and in every instance menace us.
           

              
           

             Yet it makes no nevermind.
           

              
           

             The default assumption of a free people must be suspicion that government is always and in every instance a menace to their liberties.
           

              
           

             What is history but a 5,000-year validation of that suspicion?
           

              
           

             There are nonetheless many who would voluntarily take their eyes off government.
           

              
           

             What is more, they would train government eyes on us.
           

              
           

             In brief, they want the fox to watch the henhouse.
           

              
           

             For example, New York Times technology reporter Kevin Roose. From whom:
           

              
           

             ""If left unchecked, networked conspiracy theories and online disinformation campaigns can lead to offline violence, as they did during [the Jan. 6, 2021] deadly Capitol riot...
           

              
           

             ""Unless the Biden administration treats conspiracy theories and disinformation as the urgent threats they are, our parallel universes will only drift further apart, and the potential for violent unrest and civic dysfunction will only grow.""
           

              
           

             This Roose fellow even blessed the establishment of a 'reality czar'.
           

              
           

             Do we overstate or exaggerate? We do not:
           

              
           

             ""Several experts I spoke with recommended that the Biden administration put together a cross-agency task force to tackle disinformation and domestic extremism, which would be led by something like a 'reality czar'.""
           

              
           

             Can you imagine it – a reality czar!
           

              
           

             We invite and encourage you to revisit Mencken's observations of government's innate rascality.
           

              
           

             Then come back. Recognize that Roose would place this frightful beast in control of reality itself.
           

              
           

             What would this reality czar tell us?
           

              
           

             That the 2020 presidential election was ""the most secure election in history""...that lockdowns stopped the spread...that cotton surgical masks kept the virus out...that no workable treatments were available save the vaccines...that the same vaccines resulted in no death or injury...
           

              
           

             That the Russians dynamited their own Nord Stream pipeline...that Ukraine is routing Russia...
           

              
           

             That Hunter Biden is a gifted artist...that his father never discussed business dealings with him...
           

              
           

             That the southern border of the United States is secure...that the economy has never been stronger...
           

              
           

             We hazard a reality czar might inform us these claims are true.
           

              
           

             How many are true? How many are false?
           

              
           

             It does not matter. The reality czar wields the final verdict.
           

              
           

             Let us then lift a hymn of praise for the conspiracy theorist.
           

              
           

             He is the prickly thorn in a reality czar's flesh – indeed, he is the prickly thorn in government's flesh.
           

              
           

             Without him they will proceed unwatched, unchecked and unstopped.
           

              
           

             A free society requires him and his dark suspicions...be they anchored in truth or unanchored from truth.
           

              
           

             His vigilance is the price he pays for his liberty.
           

              
           

             Thus we speak our piece for the conspiracy theorist.

2023-11-22,"Title:Platinum Price Hits Record Discount to Gold
Article:$1100 lower per ounce, nears 19th Century levels sub-50%... 


              
           


The PRICE of PLATINUM has hit a record low against the price of gold, extending the last decade's deepening discount for the industrially-useful precious metal against its 'safe haven' cousin.
           

              
           

             Rallying 7.0% last week from 14-month lows in US Dollar terms, the platinum price cut only $10 off the record discount to gold of nearly $1100 Troy per ounce set on Friday 10 November.
           

              
           

             These new record discounts – set as 
            gold retries the $2000 level for a 5th time – have come despite rising demand for platinum from the auto sector and continued hopes for booming use of platinum-based fuel cells as part of the green energy transition.
           

              
           

             Priced in the US Dollar, platinum has now traded $1000 or more below gold prices every day for almost 6 weeks, beating the run of $1000-per-Troy-ounce discounts seen 3 years ago.
           

              
           

             Compared across history, that has pulled platinum's average price so far in 2023 back down to 50.0% of this year's average gold price, close to the 120-year low of 49.7% set during the Covid pandemic, lockdowns and economic recession of 2020 – the very cheapest since the start of the 20th Century.
           

              
           




              
           

             With 
            platinum's No.1 industrial use currently coming for autocatalysts to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion engine systems, demand from carmakers is on track to rise 13.8% this year from 2022, according to data from independent analysts 
            Metals Focus published this week by the mining industry's 
            World Platinum Investment Council.
           

              
           

             Reaching the 
            largest total since 2016, that's being driven by increasing production of heavy duty trucks – almost always using diesel engines – plus substitution of more costly palladium for cheaper platinum in gasoline-engine vehicles.
           

              
           

             Moreover, that growth in automotive platinum demand lags the wider 26.1% annual growth now forecast for total platinum demand in 2023, taking it to a 4-year high.
           

              
           

             Platinum supply, in contrast, is seen at its lowest level since the global economy's Covid Crash of 2020. Down 2.5% from last year as a small rise in mining output is more than offset by a drop in recycling scrap, that will result in a record deficit of platinum supply versus demand this year, the World Platinum Investment Council says, with 
            another but smaller deficit predicted for 2024.
           

              
           

             But with platinum miners ""facing cash losses"" on production that mean they ""should be decommissioning producing mines and shuttering projects"" according to US$32bn South African fund managers Coronation – which has now 
            quit its share investments in the sector – ""Platinum miners continue to reposition for a lower price environment,"" says 
            a report from Heraeus, the German precious-metal refining company, produced by analysts SFA (Oxford).
           

              
           

             Last month Anglo American Platinum (JSE: AMS) cut 140 corporate staff while Sibanye Stillwater (JSE: SSW) said it's looking to cut 4,000 jobs across its operations. Impala Platinum (JSE: IMP) then began offering voluntary redundancy to some of its employees in mid-November to try and reduce headcount at its mines in Rustenburg, north-west South Africa.
           

              
           

             Platinum mining accounts for more than 1-in-3 of all mineral commodity jobs in South Africa.
           

              
           

             In the European Union meantime, sales of new diesel cars have now fallen beneath sales of new battery-electric cars across 2023, dropping to 
            a market share of just 12.0% in October.
           

              
           

             Diesel-engine vehicles accounted for 1-in-every-2 new passenger cars sold in Europe as recently as 2015, 
            year of the 'Diesel Scandal' over automakers cheating emissions tests to sell more polluting vehicles. Looking ahead, the 
            EU has banned the sale of new diesel or gasoline-fuelled vehicles from 2035, the same year that California – closely followed to date by many other US states on environmental policy – is 
            now targeting zero tailpipe emissions.
           

              
           

             ""I really hope I am wrong,"" said Amplats CEO Craig Miller to Reuters last month, ""but the way I am setting up the business is that [these low] prices are in place for a bit of time.""
           

              
           

             But 
            platinum prices ""seem to have fallen too fast too soon in our view,"" says analysis from Swiss bank and bullion market-maker UBS, ""
            particularly given the slowdown in EV penetration rates"" into the US and Western Europe new car markets, with electric-vehicle maker Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) in particular seeing a ""
            shallower EV adoption curve than expected"" according to Canadian bank RBC.
           

              
           

             Most electric vehicles currently use lithium-based batteries, but ""mounting social anger"" against mining for the alkali metal in the US and Europe means ""many 
            projects are going to really struggle to come online,"" says Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye – a major investor in Finland's Keliber lithium site but also the 3rd largest platinum producer behind Impala and Amplats.
           

              
           

             ""That will ultimately drive up the price of lithium and impact the cost of battery electric vehicles.""
           

              
           

             At the same time, ""Plunging prices for platinum and other critical metals 
            could derail mining investment needed to develop new supplies,"" says the 
            Wall Street Journal, ""posing a significant threat to decarbonization targets set by countries around the world.""
           

              
           

             ""There was a five-fold increase in 
            fuel cell vehicle (FCEV) production"" in Europe during the third quarter of 2023, the World Platinum Investment Council says in its latest demand-and-supply report. ""However the total for the period was still a mere 300 vehicles.
           

              
           

             ""FCEV passenger cars currently contain between three to five times more platinum loadings than the average European diesel car"" needs in its autocat system."

GOLD MINING stocks are not yet unique within the wider macro, but that does not preclude a move higher by the GDX index,

             ...the macro turn, the big picture macro turn implied by the profound change in this chart's long-term trend, and other macro indicators, is on track.
           

              
           




              
           

             That big black, nearly engulfing monthly candle on the 30-year Treasury bond yield sure will look like a reversal if we close November in this state.
           

              
           

             That will be personally appreciated for two reasons:
           

 It will make my guess per the post graphic above look like the product of genius, which it surely was not, and
 It will indicate that we are still on the preferred plans for a macro trend change, potentially of epic (and by most, unexpected) proportions.


             All of this is to say that although gold miner stocks jumped with everything else on the weaker-than-expected CPI inflation data in mid-November, that very fact means they are not yet unique.
           

              
           

             So I should reel in my ill-titled article from last week. Or more to the point, reel in the article's title: 'Gold Stocks: The Time is Now'.
           

              
           

             What I meant, and what I think is clear with a read of the article, is that the time is now as represented by the implications of the big picture chart above. As noted in the article, this would be subject to an interim and likely bull-ending seasonal broad market rally.
           

              
           

             ""Now"" is not today, this minute. Although, I think the odds are that given the developing macro, the gold miners will participate in the seasonal party that got off the ground at the end of October.
           

              
           

             The daily chart of GDX shows an imagining of a pattern first noted on Monday, the day before the big pop on CPI Tuesday. In other words, I called the low! How's them for some brazen words? Well, actually I did not call the low. I simply highlighted a pattern that had potential. Here is the chart from that post.
           

              
           




              
           

             GDX of today is still working on that theoretical pattern. As has been the case forever and a day (in NFTRH analysis, at least) the very key level to take out in order to go bullish for an extended rally, is where the 200-day moving average meets resistance and now what we can call the pattern's neckline.
           

              
           

             No breakthrough there, no pattern activation. Break through there and well, activation!
           

              
           




              
           

             If the pattern activates, the upside target, which we've had on radar for many months, is the gap above 40. That would be quite a trade. But first there is work to do. Take out the SMA 50 (28.32), resistance just above it at 29 and then the SMA 200/neckline combo. If those milestones are met, strap in for a potential hell of a trade.
           

              
           

             But consider this: The gold miners are not unique in this macro, especially if they do end the correction from the May double top and rally hard (assuming the broad bull party is ongoing).
           

              
           

             What would have made them unique is to take a final and ignominious drop while risk 'on' cyclical stuff had one final party in celebration of the weakening Fed. But if the miners celebrate and go on to our upside target of GDX 40, they will be a 'sell' when the broad markets top, as expected in H1, 2024 (we will refine the analysis as usual along the way, in NFTRH).
           

              
           

             The real buy for a long-term bull market could still be out ahead and from much lower levels. But how about this for one scenario among others? Gold stocks rally to a new high for this rally that began a year ago. The broad stock market puts on its final act (and final suck-in of the herds, in progress). Then, as the rapidly devolving inflation situation becomes uncomfortably disinflationary (ie, morphs to a deflation scare) the gold miners get sold down. We have various downside support objectives just as we have the upside GDX target of 40+.
           

              
           

             The real art; the real separation of the macro players from the pretenders, could be well out in 2024. But if the gold stock sector does rally here in Q4 (as implied by the seasonal averages), what's wrong with some outstanding profits prior to the necessary H1 2024 risk management implied by this forward macro view?
           

              
           

             Meanwhile, it appears to be macro party season with the herds being tempted back in. Herds? Frogs! In a nice warm pot, swimming and resting their little heads over the Fed hawk anxieties of the past. The setup for bullish now, disaster later is compelling.
           

              
           

             Here's the circus ringleader here.
           

              
           




              
           

             I am playing it via quality (only) gold stocks (per NFTRH weekly reports) but also through various other non-unique sectors that make sense as the US Dollar drops due to a lack of fundamental support (Fed policy).
           

              
           

             Later, in 2024, I expect to have whittled down the scope to just the best gold mining stocks I can find, some Junior/Exploration specs, and short-term Treasury bonds (after the Fed eventually flips dovish and begins backing off its elevated Funds Rate, which has been driving nice income on cash).
           

              
           

             But first, a hard sell in the miners may come about before the buy for the long-term that will be missed by most.
           

              
           

             So you see, ""now"" means 'now', as in the time of a macro change, which takes months and years. The change already began, after all, 1.5 years ago when the 30 year Treasury yield above, smashed through the formerly limiting moving averages.
           

              
           

             Gold stocks? The time is now (to prove a rally can come about) and the time is upcoming within the macro changes already in progress for a long and improbable (to most) investment phase."
2023-11-19,"Title:Freedonia Can't Escape the Trilemma, But the USA?
Article:Robert Mundell's insight still rules, except the Dollar...


              
           


TODAY we're considering the real environment that determines economic conditions, 
            writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             It has nothing to do with short-term data, Fed policy, conventional economic models or other factors most economic commentary focuses on.
           

              
           

             Instead, it has to do with the ""trilemma"" identified in the 1960s by economist Robert Mundell.
           

              
           

             Mundell identified three critical policy variables that nations face: the central bank policy rate, the exchange rate and open capital accounts. He said that nations could control any two of these variables, but not all three at once.
           

              
           

             If you want to control the policy rate and the exchange rate you can, but you have to close your capital account. Otherwise, if your policy rate is high and your capital account is open, capital will flow in and make your exchange rate higher than you want.
           

              
           

             Or if you have a set exchange rate and open capital account, you have to let your policy rate float along with other central banks to avoid the exchange rate pressure.
           

              
           

             In the first case, you control the policy rate and have an open capital account, but you lose control over exchange rates. In the second case, you control your exchange rate and have an open capital account, but you lose control of your policy rate. The only way to control the policy rate and the exchange rate is to close the capital account.
           

              
           

             As Mundell explained, you can control two of the three factors, but not all three.
           

              
           

             If you try, you will fail – markets will make sure of that. A country that attempts to have all three will fail in one of several ways including a reserve crisis, an exchange rate crisis or a recession.
           

              
           

             Consider the case of a country – call it Freedonia – that wants to cut its interest rate from 3% to 2% to stimulate growth. At the same time, Freedonia's main trading partner, Sylvania, has an interest rate of 3%.
           

              
           

             Freedonia also keeps an open capital account (to encourage direct foreign investment).
           

              
           

             Finally, Freedonia pegs its exchange rate to Sylvania at a rate of 10-1. This is a ""cheap"" exchange rate designed to stimulate exports from Freedonia to Sylvania.
           

              
           

             In this example, Freedonia is trying the impossible trinity. It wants an open capital account, a fixed exchange rate and an independent monetary policy (it has an interest rate of 2% while Sylvania's rate is 3%).
           

              
           

             What happens next?
           

              
           

             The arbitrageurs get to work. They borrow money in Freedonia at 2% in order to invest in Sylvania at 3%. This causes the Freedonia central bank to sell its foreign exchange reserves and print local currency to meet the demand for local currency loans and outbound investment.
           

              
           

             Printing the local currency puts downward pressure on the fixed exchange rate and causes inflation in local prices.
           

              
           

             Eventually something breaks.
           

              
           

             Country Freedonia may run out of foreign exchange forcing it to close the capital account or break the peg (this is what happened to the UK in 1992 when George Soros broke the Bank of England).
           

              
           

             Or country Freedonia will print so much money that inflation will get out of control forcing it to raise interest rates again.
           

              
           

             The exact policy response can vary, but the end result is that country Freedonia cannot maintain the trilemma. It will have to raise interest rates, close the capital account, break the peg or all three in order to avoid losing all of its foreign exchange and going broke.
           

              
           

             This shows you how powerful the trilemma is as an analytic tool.
           

              
           

             The major economies today all have mostly open capital accounts (although China does impose some restrictions), which means they can control interest rates or exchange rates, but not both.
           

              
           

             Most major economies fix short-term interest rates, which means they lose control over exchange rates.
           

              
           

             This means the interest rate and the exchange rate have to be thought of as a pair. A higher interest rate generally results in a stronger currency. That's exactly what the US is experiencing today where sharply higher interest rates have resulted in a stronger Dollar.
           

              
           

             The ability of central banks to pursue any interest rate policy they might prefer is further constrained by conditions in the real economy.
           

              
           

             Central banks target policy rates intended to produce maximum real growth, low unemployment and price stability.
           

              
           

             As noted above, if maximum potential real growth in the US is about 3%, the Fed will target a neutral rate of interest (also called r*) that will produce 3% growth, which is consistent with price stability and should optimize employment at the same time.
           

              
           

             If the Fed guesses at a neutral rate that is too high, they will slow the economy, hurt job growth and cause disinflation or deflation. If the Fed guesses at a neutral rate that is too low, they will cause the economy to run hot, tighten labor markets and cause inflation.
           

              
           

             Since the Fed is guessing, they are likely to guess wrong. Sooner than later, the Fed's incorrect guess shows up in economic data.
           

              
           

             Still, the result of trying to hit a neutral rate means central banks will wander high or low while trying to converge on the unseen target. Other central banks are doing the same.
           

              
           

             This neutral rate targeting combined with Mundell's trilemma shows us that all major central banks with reserve currency status are not really free agents but are highly constrained by the need to hit the neutral rate, avoid inflation or deflation and maintain reasonably stable exchange rates.
           

              
           

             This is a highly imperfect process with many errors committed along the way, but it does provide a framework for forecasting international monetary policy using just a few key factors.
           

              
           

             By the way, there's historically been one big exception to the trilemma. That's the United States.
           

              
           

             The US sets interest rates independently and has an open capital account. The US does not officially peg the Dollar to any other currency (thus technically not breaking the trilemma). But it does work with other countries to allow them to informally peg to the Dollar.
           

              
           

             Why hasn't the US suffered adverse consequences? Because the US doesn't need foreign exchange.
           

              
           

             The Dollar is still the leading reserve currency in the world (about 60% of global reserves and close to 90% of global foreign exchange trades), so the US can never run out of foreign exchange to pay for things. It can just print more Dollars!
           

              
           

             This is what the French called the Dollar's ""exorbitant privilege"" in the 1960s.
           

              
           

             Now you see why so many trading partners like the BRICS nations are trying to escape from a Dollar-denominated global system (among other reasons, like escaping Dollar-based sanctions).
           

              
           

             The game is rigged against other countries, and in favor of the US.
           

              
           

             This is why the game won't last – and why King Dollar's days are numbered."

             Why should sand castles endure when the tide transitions?
           

              
           

             And why should industries endure when interest rates transition?
           

              
           

             If their foundations are firm they will withstand the attending blows.
           

              
           

             Here is a fact, an elemental and fundamental fact:
           

              
           

             ""Green"" energy – wind power, solar power, electric vehicles and the rest – remains vastly inefficient.
           

              
           

             It cannot endure absent heavy government subsidy.
           

              
           

             For example, our scientific men inform us that the American taxpayer extravagantly subsidizes the American electric vehicle industry. By how much?
           

              
           

             They inform us these subsidies will near $400 billion in coming years.
           

              
           

             What Ukraine would not give to receive that $400 billion! What Israel would not give to receive that $400 billion!
           

              
           

             What Raytheon would not give to receive that $400 billion!
           

              
           

             Alas it will be unavailable to them. It will go to the subsidization of electric vehicles.
           

              
           

             Our sister publication, The Paradigm Pressroom, recently cited a study by the Edison Electric Institute.
           

              
           

             From which:
           

              
           

             ""EV advocates claim that the cost of electricity for EV owners is equal to $1.21 per gallon of gasoline, but the cost of charging equipment and charging losses, averaged out over 10 years and 120,000 miles, is $1.38 per gallon equivalent on top of that.""
           

              
           

             ""So $2.59 per gallon? I could live with that!"" said colleague Emily Clancy. [European readers can't dream of it, nor the current US price either.]
           

              
           

             As could your editor – and very likely you.
           

              
           

             Regular gasoline presently trades at $3.34 the gallon. Premium gasoline presently trades at $4.14 the gallon.
           

              
           

             Seen in this aspect $2.59 is lovely.
           

              
           

             The Green New Dealers, its idiots useful and unuseful, its buglers in the media and the business concerns receiving the subsidies, will tell you it is in fact lovely.
           

              
           

             Yet let us peer within this sweet, sweet bargain. Let us glance the fine print within the contract...
           

              
           

             What does it read?
           

              
           

             Adding the costs of the subsidies to the true cost of fueling an EV would equate to an EV owner paying $17.33 per gallon of gasoline.
           

              
           

             $17.33 the gallon! How do you like it?
           

              
           

             Yet you cannot see it because it does not strike your eye at the charging station.
           

              
           

             It requires a more sensitive and penetrating ophthalmological apparatus to detect it.
           

              
           

             It requires a finer vision. Most – alas – do not have it.
           

              
           

             More from the abovesaid Edison Electric Institute:
           

              
           

             ""The average model year (MY) 2021 EV would cost $48,698 more to own over a 10-year period without $22 billion in government favors given to EV manufacturers and owners.
           

              
           

             ""When we add up these hidden costs, we find that the lifetime cost of a typical EV is far greater than that of an [internal-combustion engine vehicle].""
           

              
           

             Without government subsidy the $54,000 electric vehicle would have been yours for $102,698.
           

              
           

             The additional $48,698 is handsome – even across 10 years. It is nearly $5,000 per year.
           

              
           

             How many electric vehicles that sold for $54,000 would have remained unsold at $102,698?
           

              
           

             We hazard the answer is very high. Comes the retort:
           

              
           

             ""But we need these subsidies to increase EV usage. We have to transition away from fossil fuels in order to save the planet.""
           

              
           

             Well then, in order to save the planet you must wreck the planet – if you believe fossil fuels wreck the planet.
           

              
           

             That is because the charging stations required to fuel these vehicles themselves run largely on fossil fuels.
           

              
           

             Fossil fuels generate some 60% of United States electricity.
           

              
           

             And if you wish to expand electrical vehicle use you must expand the number of charging stations to fuel them.
           

              
           

             That of course means you must expand your consumption of fossil fuels.
           

              
           

             If you do not you cannot keep these vehicles going.
           

              
           

             Meantime our men inform us that:
           

              
           

             If the standard American household transitioned to electric vehicles...the additional electrical consumption would equal 25 refrigerators.
           

              
           

             The standard American household stables one refrigerator unit.
           

              
           

             Now imagine an additional 24 such units ensconced within each home...devouring electricity...from midnight to midnight...seven days of the seven...365 days of the 365.
           

              
           

             Is this the picture of energy conservation? Or is it the picture of energy gluttony?
           

              
           

             And if you cling to the belief in climate Armageddon...is this not its author?
           

              
           

             A related question arises:
           

              
           

             How could the existing electrical grid possibly take the load?
           

              
           

             It cannot. It is not possible.
           

              
           

             Yet we are told we must drive electric cars if we are to conserve the planet.
           

              
           

             What then is required?
           

              
           

             The answer is an expanded energy grid – and $760 million in subsidies to install it.
           

              
           

             Reports the International Energy Agency:
           

              
           

             ""The US Congressional Budget Office estimates that total support from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 will surpass $430 billion from 2022 through to 2031, of which the IRA provides $760 million in grants to siting authorities to facilitate the siting and permitting of transmission projects. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the US IRA could enable...a 16% increase in total installed capacity relative to the current level.""
           

              
           

             Of course a 16% increase in total installed capacity will remain vastly inadequate to needs – if each American is to wheel around in an electric vehicle.
           

              
           

             Yet the businesses that receive the subsidies will roll in clover.
           

              
           

             Their hands will extend – deeply – into taxpayer pockets.
           

              
           

             What of wind and solar energies? They too receive vast subsidization.
           

              
           

             They too cannot subsist without it.
           

              
           

             Yet do they hold out hope against the ""climate crisis""?
           

              
           

             The subsidization may, in that instance, prove worthy.
           

              
           

             Yet the answer – evidently – is no.
           

              
           

             Wind and solar hopes must go dashing against the rocks of fundamental physics.
           

              
           

             Mark Mills co-directs Northwestern University's Institute on Manufacturing Science and Innovation.
           

              
           

             He says, as we have noted before:
           

              
           

             ""All sources of energy have limits that can't be exceeded. The maximum rate at which the sun's photons can be converted to electrons is about 33%. Our best solar technology is at 26% efficiency. For wind, the maximum capture is 60%. Our best machines are at 45%. So we're pretty close to wind and solar limits. Despite big claims about big gains coming, there just aren't any possible.""
           

              
           

             If this fellow is correct – our minions inform us he is – we must conclude we are being taken for a sleigh ride.
           

              
           

             Wind and solar energy are vastly inadequate to energy needs. And they will likely remain inadequate to energy needs through the end of the chapter.
           

              
           

             The physics, after all, is the physics.
           

              
           

             And the physics places harsh constraints upon them.
           

              
           

             Yet the businesses that traffic in them are extremely efficient absorbers of capital – capital that could be dedicated to productive use in other industries.
           

              
           

             If it is crony capitalists you seek, here you have them.
           

              
           

             They could not endure absent taxpayer subsidy.
           

              
           

             All this we confront because of a claimed climate crisis that finds little excuse in the observable facts.
           

              
           

             Our scientific men inform us there is no credible evidence indicating that carbon dioxide constitutes an environmental menace whatsoever.
           

              
           

             It is simply not sufficiently formidable.
           

              
           

             Our men further inform us that climate forecasting models are pure botchwork.
           

              
           

             Each of these models has vastly exaggerated the degree of actual warming. Each of them.
           

              
           

             That is, they stand discredited by the actual record.
           

              
           

             Yet there are those who continue to cite them – among them those who gain most from the subsidies.
           

              
           

             If the world prefers wind over oil, if the world prefers solar over coal...let the world have wind and solar over oil and coal.
           

              
           

             It is all one to us.
           

              
           

             And if the world wishes to roll around in electric vehicles, let it roll around in electric vehicles.
           

              
           

             We simply ask to be excused. Let the world do it on its own dime. Leave ours out of it."
2023-11-15,"Title:Fed to World: Inflation's Over
Article:Oh yeah? Let's check what bonds are saying...

 SO the FEDERAL RESERVE sat upon its hands again with its November decision, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 No rate hike.
 Mr.Powell left his sword in its sheath.
 The stock market reacted initially with a shrug of its slumping shoulders.
 That is because it did not anticipate a rate increase. Thus its expectations were merely affirmed.
 Stocks seeped higher following the announcement. Then they have leapt higher upon further consideration.
 Yet the fleeting fancies of the market, its momentary moods, its passing passions, hold little fascination for us.
 They amuse us – to the verge of tears at times. Yet they do not fascinate us.
 It is the grand sweep that fascinates us...the long view...the view of the circling eagle high overhead.
 And the eagle's gaze presently fixes upon the bond market...
 As we have noted previously, clinging to our aviary theme:
 The flighty birds of the moment congregate in the stock market.
 Yet the owls – the wise owls – nest in the bond market.
 The bond market will tell you where the economy is heading, they say.
 It is not so easily foxed by the Federal Reserve's garish and gaudy tricks. With knowing eyes it penetrates the magician's secrets...and exposes the fraud upon the stage.
 The bond market knows where the rabbit came from. It knows where the vanished gal is.
 It observes the wires holding the levitating subject aloft.
 New York Times economics reporter Neil Irwin:
 ""Savvy economic analysts have always known the bond market is the place to look for a real sense of where the economy is going, or at least where the smart money thinks it is going.""
 What economic future does the smart money – the bond market – presently foresee?
 It foresees a sort of transition point...
 A transition point at which previously escalating interest rates begin to work their way through the economic machinery.
 Since last March the Federal Reserve's target rate has leapt from 0.50% to 5.50%.
 And since July 2020 the 10-year Treasury has skyshot from 0.53% to nearly 5%.
 Thus the movement of decades compresses into years and very nearly months.
 Jim Grant, editor of the eponymous Grant's Interest Rate Observer:
 ""The movement from interest rates bordering on nothing to interest rates knocking on the door of normal – that speed of rise – is something we have rarely, if ever, seen before. It's like a car going from 0 to 60 mph in four seconds. So this is...a very disruptive rise because it has been so fast.""
 Thus we have an economy going largely on momentum. The 60-mph vehicle is on the chase. Yet has not yet run it down.
 Yet history argues it will. Grant:
 ""Going back about 150 years, there has been a succession of bond bull and bear markets, each one at least 20 years in length...bond yields fell from around the end of the Civil War for 35 years to the end of the 19th century.
 ""Then, they rose very gradually for 20 years, whereupon they fell again from around 1921-1946. Next, the great postwar bond bear market began, taking yields all the way up to 15% in 1981. After that, the great bond bull market started that took yields down to 1% in 2021.""
 Again, the 10-year Treasury yield presently nears 5%. Mr.Grant notes the average cycle runs to 20 years. Yet the previous cycle commenced in 1981.
 Forty years – twice the 20-year average!
 We operate from a theory. It is a theory we in fact cherish.
 That is the theory that time – and/or the gods – iron out extremes.
 The greater an elastic band is stretched, the more energetically it will snap back.
 Scales balance even, that which goes up comes down, that which goes down comes up.
 In brief: Time equalizes all.
 And if the term ""mean reversion"" has anything in it – we believe it does – the bond market is in for a whale of a mean reversion.
 Assume the 20-year cycle.
 The bond market has amassed an additional 20 years of potential energy...awaiting translation into kinetic energy.
 The transition commenced in 2021. Jim Grant:
 ""So perhaps since 2021 we have begun a lengthy excursion to the upside in yields – and if that's the case, the catchphrase ought to be not 'yields for longer' but 'yields for much, much, much longer'...
 ""So it might just be that we are embarked on rates much, much, much higher for much, much, much longer. And it might just be that we are embarked on not just a cycle of inflation but an age of inflation.""
 But are we prepared for this age of inflation, for this age of ""yields for much, much, much longer""?
 I suspect that this most sudden and even violent lurch higher in interest rates is going to test financial structures that came into being during the period of very low nominal interest rates.
 Think of what all came into being, when money was proverbially free from 2010-2021...there were no constraints on sovereign debt issuance, so public credit was expanded dramatically. Interest expense seemed to be forever minimal and not worrisome because, after all, rates would never rise. To some degree, the entire world was capitalized on the expectation of extremely low interest rates...
 Persistent, if not continuous declines in rates have been the norm for the careers and investment minds of most living human beings.
 Consequently, expectations are deeply embedded in our collective psyche that rates do one thing, which is to decline. Yet here we are, observing them go up...So far, the stock market pretends not to notice.
 We are not the least bit surprised the stock market pretends not to notice.
 Recall, the stock market is where the flighty birds congregate. And that the wise oils nest in the bond market.
 We hazard the latter will be munching popcorn at one point – and at the former's expense. When?
 We cannot precisely say. We cannot even imprecisely say.
 The economy presently goes on momentum as we argued above. We simply do not know when this reserve energy depletes.
 Yet like Mr.Grant we believe it is ""in the making"":
 ""I think people are still trying to deal with the shock of the perception of the possibility of much higher rates for a long time. Not every company has had to refinance so far, not every private equity company has met a hostile reception in the credit markets and not every country has had to face the consequences of a potentially ruinously high national invoice for interest expense. All this is still in the making.""
 Things that are in the making come eventually out of the making. They are made.
 ""The mills of the gods grind slowly,"" said ancient Greek Sextus Empiricus...
 ""But they grind exceedingly fine.""
 How fine they will grind in this particular instance...we do not know.
 We pray the gods are kind."
2023-11-14,"Title:US Debt? Stop Worrying. It's Fine
Article:Everything is fine. Repeat, everything...

 TOTAL U.S. DEBT now stands at $33.6 trillion. But this is fine, writes Tim Price at PriceValuePartners.
 83% of US tax revenue in the last fiscal year was spent solely on social security, Medicare, the military, and interest on the national debt. But this is fine.
 In mid-2020, the yield on the 10 year US Treasury bond – essentially, the global benchmark 'risk-free rate' – was at approximately 0.5%. It now stands at 5%. A surge higher of such magnitude in such a short period of time has probably never happened before. But this is fine.
 For the six months to August, China, the second-largest foreign creditor to the United States, sold more than $45 billion of its Treasury holdings, according to official data. But this is fine.
 Meanwhile the US Federal Reserve, which owns a large amount of US government debt that it has bought to support bond markets during periods of financial volatility, has begun to shrink the size of its balance sheet, reducing demand for US Treasuries just as the government needs to borrow even more. But this is fine.
 Money supply growth in the US, on a monthly basis, is negative for the first time since the 1950s; on an annual basis, it is negative for the first time since the Great Depression. But this is fine.
 Three of the four largest bank failures in US history took place during the early summer. More than $500 bn has had to be written off since March. But this is fine.
 When Alan Greenspan was Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2001, he enjoyed a Gallup confidence level of 74%. Jerome Powell currently enjoys a confidence level of 36%. But this is fine.
 From 'Grant's Interest Rate Observer':
 ""We face a possible Dollar inflation uncertainty nightmare,"" writes the economist Charles W. Calomiris, in – of all places – a quarterly journal of the Federal Reserve System. The worst imaginable consequences of the subordination of monetary management to the public debt is the subject before the house.
 ""Fiscal Dominance and the Return of Zero-Interest Bank Reserve Requirements"" is the unsensational headline over the essay in which Calomiris advances his pulse-pounding conclusions. In it, the Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions Emeritus at the Columbia Business School speculates about a looming fiscal crisis, a buyers' strike against Treasury securities and the monetary-policy response to this imagined catastrophe. Suffice it to say that it isn't bullish.
 ""Many readers, not remembering the failed Treasury-bond auction of Aug. 1, 1973, will doubt that a creditors' strike is even conceivable. However, there's no quarrelling with the proposition that the Treasury is borrowing trouble. Calomiris chooses to preface his article with an excerpt from the Feb. 16 Financial Report of the United States Government, which reads:
 ""Under current policy and based on this report's assumptions, [government debt relative to GDP] is projected to reach 566% by 2097. The projected continuous rise of the debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that current policy is unsustainable.""
 Still, everything is fine...
 ...but just in case everything isn't fine, now would be a good time to reassess what you own in your investment portfolio, and why you own it."
2023-11-14,"Title:Platinum FCEVs Showcased at Paris 2024 Olympics
Article:Toyota aims to cut 2024 Games' emissions in half...

 NEXT YEAR's Olympic Games in Paris will showcase how platinum-based hydrogen technology can help achieve the goal of net zero, says the World Platinum Investment Council.
 As the worldwide mobility partner of the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee for Paris 2024, Toyota is looking to provide sustainable transport solutions for athletes, officials, volunteers, accredited media and spectators.
 Overall, Toyota aims to reduce vehicle carbon emissions at the Paris 2024 Games by 50 per cent compared to those of previous Games, while ensuring much of the total Toyota 'Olympic' fleet will be produced in Europe, including 37 per cent in France, contributing to the vision of a 'locally-sourced' Olympic and Paralympic Games.
 As part of its plans, Toyota will be deploying some 500 of its Mirai passenger fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). In addition, it is planning to showcase up to ten different hydrogen mobility applications. These will range from buses and trucks to boats and forklifts – all demonstrating the potential of a hydrogen-powered society and resulting from Toyota's integration of its fuel cell technology with other partners.
 Among the hydrogen applications to be displayed at Paris 2024 are two FCEV city buses, each able to accommodate an entire wheelchair team, having been converted specifically for the occasion, with accessibility and team spirit in mind.
 Further demonstrating how platinum-based fuel cells can be used to power all modes of transport, Toyota is using its fuel cell technology to develop a light-duty FCEV truck for the mass market with its partners Isuzu, Hino and Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation.
 Light-duty trucks are often used for distribution by supermarket chains and convenience stores. In addition to being equipped with refrigeration and freezing functions, they are required to drive long distances over extended hours to perform multiple delivery operations in one day. They must also meet requirements such as fast refuelling. The use of hydrogen-fuelled fuel cell technology, which produces zero CO2 emissions while driving, is considered highly effective under such operating conditions.
 Toyota is not alone in recognising the important role a sustainable, hydrogen-powered mobility ecosystem can play in the transition to net zero.
 Bosch's fuel-cell power module is now in volume production, and the company is focused on developing a circular economy model that will see the valuable raw materials in its fuel cells – especially platinum – recovered and recycled at the end of a fuel cell's useful life.
 Platinum acts as a catalyst in a fuel cell, accelerating the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, and Bosch believes that 95 per cent of the platinum in fuel cell stacks can be recovered."
2023-11-13,"Title:Dollar Beats Brics, Debt, Deficits
Article:For now, at least...

 The DOLLAR has been extremely strong over the past two years, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 This persistent Dollar strength has been a mystery to many. After all, the Dollar's problems are well known.
 The ratio of government debt to GDP for the United States is at a record high approaching 130% (a prudent level is considered 30%, and anything over 90% is a headwind to any economic growth at all).
 The US is running multitrillion-Dollar deficits year after year. The Congress and White House seem in the grip of Modern Monetary Theory, which claims that the US can run unlimited deficits and accumulate unlimited debt without economic harm because it can print money in unlimited quantities to finance the debt and spending.
 Meanwhile, projected annualized interest payments on the US national debt exceeded $1 trillion at the end of October, according to Bloomberg. The cost of debt service has doubled in the past 19 months as interest rates have risen.
 This fiscal profligacy comes against a backdrop of social unrest and political dysfunction. We're facing a presidential election next year in which one candidate, Biden, is senile and the other candidate, Trump, may be behind bars on Election Day.
 Take your pick. But the Dollar keeps on chugging along. How can the Dollar be so strong against such a dismal landscape?
 There are two answers to this question.
 Answer No.1 The first is that the Dollar has its problems, but other currencies are in even worse shape. For example, the Chinese Yuan is on the brink of collapse being held aloft by non-sustainable intervention by Chinese banks.
 The Japanese Yen is joined at the hip with the Yuan because of the extent of Japanese investment in China financed by Japanese banks. With the Yuan going down, the Yen will go down in sync.
 So that's two major currencies with problems.
 Meanwhile, Europe and the UK have deindustrialized under the sway of the greeniacs pushing the Green New Scam policies. Now Europe faces a winter of freezing in the dark if cold weather is extreme and Russia decides to turn off the energy taps.
 Germany, the largest economy in the Eurozone, is heading for recession if it isn't already in one, and the same is true for the UK That's two more major currencies facing troubles.
 So yes, the Dollar has its problems, but as an investor do you really prefer sterling, Euros, Yen or Yuan?
 Answer No.2 The second reason for the Dollar's strength is much more technical and not well understood, but it's critical to grasp. You don't need to nail down the technical details; it's enough that you understand the bigger picture.
 It involves the so-called Eurodollar.
 Eurodollars are Dollar-denominated deposits held at foreign offices of major banks, and therefore fall outside the jurisdiction of the Fed and US banking regulations.
 The Fed actually has very little influence over the global Dollar market and the exchange value of the Dollar. The old currency metrics of balance of trade and moves in capital accounts are leftovers from the world of fixed exchange rates, which have been gone for decades.
 What drives the Dollar is the Eurodollar market, as conducted by the world's largest banks in London, New York and Tokyo. It's here where global liquidity and interest rates are actually determined.
 The Eurodollar market needs a constant supply of depositors parking their money in offshore offices of major banks.
 Right now, this market is in contraction.
 Derivatives are being unwound, balance sheets are being trimmed and interbank overnight lending is being financed with collateral.
 And these banks are demanding the best collateral. They won't accept corporate debt, mortgages or even intermediate-term US Treasuries. The only acceptable collateral consists of short-term US Treasury bills, the shorter the better. This means 1-month, 3-month and 6-month bills.
 Those are denominated in Dollars, of course. In order to get the bills to post as collateral, banks have to buy Dollars to buy the bills. This has created enormous demand for Dollars. And that partly accounts for the strength of the Dollar.
 Again, it's not important that you understand the intricacies of the Eurodollar system, just that high Dollar demand in the Eurodollar market is contributing to Dollar strength.
 The fundamental Dollar shortage problem is not going away soon, and will continue to support the Dollar.
 What about the prospect of a BRICS currency union and the move toward a new currency? I wrote a lot about that ahead of the BRICS Leadership Summit that took place back in August.
 This new currency would be gold-linked and would displace the Dollar in time as a major player in world trade.
 Shouldn't that be weakening the Dollar?
 After all, the prospect of a BRICS currency should pose a severe threat to the Petrodollar, which is a pillar of Dollar strength.
 But this movement is still in its infancy and, unsurprisingly, is experiencing growing pains.
 It's not yet as unified as it needs to be if it's going to seriously threaten the Dollar. And one of those BRICS nations – India – seems to be playing both sides.
 It was recently reported that India's government is expected to reject demands from Russian oil companies to pay for Russia's crude oil imports in Chinese Yuan.
 Russia currently has a surplus of rupees and is having trouble spending them. At the same time, demand for Yuan has grown as Russia trades more with China.
 Meanwhile, India mostly uses the dirham and US Dollar to pay for Russian oil imports. Basically, India is currently in a balancing act. They consider Russia an important economic ally while they consider China a geopolitical rival.
 India fears popularizing the Yuan will hurt its own efforts to internationalize the rupee. In fact, India was the only BRICS nation to oppose the introduction of a common currency, fearing it would benefit the Yuan.
 India's refusal to give in to Russia's demands leaves a significant role for the Dollar, which is another reason to believe the Dollar will retain its strength for the foreseeable future.
 Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the Dollar is strong. It isn't, for all the reasons I listed above. It's just stronger than its competitors, and that's why it appears strong.
 Is there some way to tell if the Dollar is actually getting stronger or weaker without making reference to other currencies?
 Yes. The answer is gold. Think of gold as a ruler that measures Dollar strength or weakness.
 Gold has gained close to 10% over the past month or so. I expect gold to become much stronger, despite some temporary setbacks along the way.
 Investors should consider today's prices a gift and perhaps a last chance to acquire gold at these prices before the real safe haven race begins.
 Below $2000 gold is so cheap right now, it's practically a steal. I strongly urge you to take advantage."
2023-11-11,"Title:US Fed Losing Money. So What?
Article:Capital vs. operating losses help unpick the controversy...

 The FEDERAL RESERVE is running losses. Does this cost anyone anything? ask Jane L.Johnson at the Cobden Centre, in this post first published at Mises.org.
 Financial statements of the US Federal Reserve, which consists of the board of governors in Washington and twelve district reserve banks across the country, indicate that the consolidated system has generated both capital and operating losses for the past couple of years.
 The Fed was created in 1913 to issue and circulate an ""elastic currency"" that could respond to consumers' demand for cash, end bank runs known then as ""money panics,"" and serve as a ""lender of last resort"" to the nation's commercial banks.
 How is it possible that the Fed could be losing money after one hundred years of operation?
 The debate has raged in the banking and finance communities. Two investigators, Paul Kupiec at the American Enterprise Institute and Alex Pollock at the Mises Institute, have analyzed Fed financial statements and presented their findings about these Fed losses in publications such as the Wall Street Journal and on the websites of the American Enterprise Institute, the Mises Institute, the Federalist Society, and Law and Liberty. The Wall Street Journal has also produced a nontechnical video explaining how the Fed makes (and loses) money.
 The Fed's capital losses are derived from its large bond portfolio of low-coupon US Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchased in earlier times of low rates during the period of quantitative easing following the 2008-09 financial crisis.
 As the Fed has now raised interest rates in its efforts to reduce inflation, the market value of its bond portfolio has inevitably declined. Estimates of these capital losses range as high as $100 billion. The bond portfolio resides in the System Open Market Account, which is managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of the entire Fed system.
 The Fed's operating losses, on the other hand, result when its expenses run higher than its revenues. The Fed's revenues consist mostly of interest income on its large bond portfolio. The Fed's expenses include payment of interest on commercial banks' reserves on deposit at Fed district banks and reverse repurchase (repo) transactions with money market funds, as well as Fed overhead expenses such as the operations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is funded by the Fed rather than as an independent agency funded by Congress. The US Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of this funding arrangement between the Fed and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
 The Fed's expenses are annually running $100 billion above Fed revenues, with potentially higher levels later. Such operating losses are unique for the Fed, which throughout its years of operation has generated annual surpluses. These surpluses are by law transferred to the US Treasury to help pay the many governmental expenses such as defense, entitlement programs, interest on federal debt, and the many other myriad federal outlays.
 The Fed's operating and capital losses are genuine in both an accounting and an economic sense. Though the Federal Reserve has designed its own accounting rules rather than subscribing to those of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Fed's own financial reports clearly show ongoing accounting losses by any metric. And because of interest rate increases since 2022, the market value of the Fed's portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities has declined.
 Both types of losses are also genuine in terms of the economic principle that one cannot gain something for nothing, that nothing is ""free"" despite claims to the contrary, and every action or choice taken in life always incurs an opportunity cost measured as the cost of the foregone option.
 Economics also analyzes the incidence of costs – that is, on whom the cost burden actually falls, which is not necessarily the party on whom it may initially appear to fall. Although a retail sales tax, for example, is nominally paid by a buyer at the point of sale, further analysis reveals that the incidence of a sales tax falls on both buyer and seller (but not necessarily in equal shares), depending on the relative price elasticities (i.e., responsiveness to price changes) of supply and demand for the item in question. With respect to the Fed's losses, on whom these losses fall is another matter, but economic analysis clearly shows that these losses are not without costs to one or more parties.
 Two candidates are likely to absorb the Fed's operating losses:

 American taxpayers as a whole. Now that the Fed is incurring operating losses instead of surpluses that would otherwise be paid over to the US Treasury, federal budget deficits are commensurately larger, requiring the Treasury to sell more debt in order pay its bills. This is an obvious cost to American current and future taxpayers.
 Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve system, which are required to buy and hold stock shares in their respective Fed district banks. The 1913 Federal Reserve Act specified that these member banks could be assessed for Fed system losses. If the Fed were to make this demand of its member commercial banks, they would be obligated to cover the Fed system's losses. Again, there is no precedent for this.

Some observers disagree that the Fed's operating and capital losses must be borne by one or more parties.
 Jason Furman, a professor at Harvard University's John F.Kennedy School of Government and former chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, expresses an alternate view. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he explains that the Fed turned a cumulative profit of over $1 trillion from 2008-22, and that current annual losses of about $100 billion do not impede the Fed's ability to fulfil its mandate to ensure maximum employment and price stability.
 With rising interest rates, the Fed is paying higher rates to commercial banks' deposits held at Fed district banks, well in excess of what it earns on its portfolio of Treasury and Mutual Broadcasting System securities. Now that the Fed is running losses, it simply books them as a ""deferred asset,"" an accounting technique unique to its own accounting rules.
 Furman further explains that the Fed was never designed to turn a profit, and that the Fed need not hold any capital because insolvency is a meaningless concept in the world of central banking. He also explicitly notes ""partisan gamesmanship and shortsightedness"" as a reason not to denigrate the Fed's fluctuating profits as it apolitically fulfils its mandated responsibilities.
 Kupiec and Pollock responded with a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal to reiterate their earlier conclusions that American taxpayers will ultimately bear the cost of the Fed's losses. When asked by email how he can justify his claim that no one, including taxpayers, actually bears the cost of the Fed's losses, Professor Furman responded as follows:
 The Fed's losses do lead to higher debt. And its gains to lower debt. On net it has reduced the debt. But it is a public entity and we didn't assign it the job of maximizing profits – and for good reason – we should leave that to the private sector. Instead we assigned it macroeconomic goals which it has done well at times and done badly at other times – like in not responding fast enough to inflation in 2021.
 The accounting analysis clearly indicates that the Fed system is presently incurring both operating and capital losses. Honest differences of opinion can arise, but numbers do not lie. And economic principles tell us that no one can reap something for nothing, that the costs and benefits of any action will always redound to one or more parties.
 Do political agendas perhaps explain the differences in opinion about the Fed's losses? Is it possible that investigators at two right-of-center think tanks can read the data so differently than does an Ivy League university professor?
 Denying that taxpayers will ultimately bear the cost of the Fed's dual losses is tantamount to averring that inflation isn't a tax on everyone, or that federal student loan forgiveness doesn't cost taxpayers anything. If the Federal Reserve system truly were able to withstand continuing losses into the future with no consequence or cost, it may prove a bigger bonanza for American taxpayers than alchemists believed they could achieve when attempting to transform base metal into gold."
2023-11-09,"Title:Fed Reform Now! Again!
Article:Clean up the bordello but don't hurt its business...

 IT'S a common refrain in certain economic circles, says Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 ""We need to reform the Federal Reserve.""
 We are told this should be done or that should be done.
 This will make it more efficient, that will make it more transparent.
 And perhaps even it would.
 Yet we take a dim view of most ""reform"". The reason is simple as Sam and clear as gin.
 Reform is an ax that rarely strikes the root. That is often by design.
 It is designed to deliver a glancing blow – to leave the root largely unhacked.
 That is because too many interested parties draw sap from the root.
 It is the very source of their prosperity.
 Authentic reform would shatter the root – and the sustenance it offers a selected few.
 H.L.Mencken labeled reform ""mainly a conspiracy of prehensile charlatans to mulct the American taxpayer.""
 We believe he was correct.
 The late libertarian Frank Chodorov said most reform aspires to ""clean up the whorehouse [while] keeping the business intact.""
 For a more fitting analogy we seek in vain.
 We file only this one caveat:
 The whorehouse – for all its sin – at least does an honest trade.
 A fellow emerges from this den of carnality somewhat lighter in the wallet, it is true. Yet he also emerges somewhat lighter in spirits.
 He has gotten value for money.
 Can the same be said for the Federal Reserve?
 Its very business is false.
 It manipulates interest rates that send false signals to markets.
 It inflates bubble after bubble. What is a bubble but a monstrous falsehood?
 Yet even most ""reformers"" – there are exceptions – accept the Federal Reserve's central role.
 That is the distortion and manipulation of interest rates.
 To these reformers it is a fact as elemental as gravity...or the ebbing and flowing of the tides...or the imbecility of a congressman of the United States.
 Eliminating that role is the one reform they will not consider.
 Is it true reform you seek? In the spirit of benevolence so characteristic of us...here we propose our own modest reform:
 The Federal Reserve ceases all manipulation of interest rates and influence upon the same.
 That is, that the Federal Reserve ceases distorting the price of credit.
 That is, that the Federal Reserve ceases distorting the price of time itself.
 You say our reform is less reform than abolition – that our implement of reform is a wrecking ball rather than a chisel.
 Perhaps you are correct. Very few would agree to it. Let us then propose a reform far more modest:

 Restore the Federal Reserve's original purpose of providing liquidity to otherwise solvent banks in event of financial crisis.
 Strike from its statute the twin mandates of ""price stability"" and ""full employment.""

There you have a reasonable reform...at least by our liver and lights.
 The Federal Reserve would work far less mischief if implemented.
 Yet if it is ultimate reform you seek, this we suggest in seven short words:
 ""The Federal Reserve Act is hereby repealed.""
 That is, reform the entire business off the Earth.
 This – incidentally – is within the lawful power of the Congress of the United States.
 No more setting, influencing or in any way bullying short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, intermediate interest rates or any other interest rates.
 Let the market find its own level – high, low, all platforms in between.
 Turn the credit business over to borrowers and lenders on the free market...as the prices of automobiles, computers, chewing gum, floor mops and catcher's mitts are turned over to the free market.
 Let the devil take the hindmost.
 Will there be losers? Of course there will be losers – but does not the current arrangement yield its losers?
 There will also be winners. And likely among them will be many of today's losers who the present arrangement disfavors.
 Most importantly, it would wring the wild excesses from the financial system.
 The booms would not thunder nearly as loudly – or for nearly as long.
 Yet nor would the busts.
 Thus you have our simple proposal of reform. We offer it today in the highest spirit of public service.
 It will be enacted the instant Hell is an ice sheet."
2023-11-08,"Title:Bankster Hate Gold? Must Really Hate Oil
Article:What the gold/oil ratio says about yellow and black...

 The GOLD PRICE has been taking a hit but importantly, crude oil is taking a harder hit, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.   Let us hear no ghost stories about Banksters attacking gold or as Larry would say inflicting a ""take down"" on poor old gold, as if it's planned, personal and a war of good vs. evil. Well it is, but ""evil"" is a moving target and sometimes wolves hide in sheep's clothing.
 Using the associated ETFs, let's take a look.
 It's a metal dug out of the ground that represents an ancient tie to monetary value. So, if gold is getting dunked today, what do you suppose is happening to a commodity that is not monetary?
 Oh, well I guess it's not personal. In fact, the gold price is ticking a new recovery high vs. the oil price.
 
 So if the Banksters hate gold they must utterly despise oil.
 Either that or the markets are simply doing what they are supposed to be doing at this point of the macro in transition. A side benefit, that will confuse the 'buy gold, silver, copper, oil, hogs!!!' herd, a rising Gold/Oil ratio is a discretely positive fundamental for the gold mining industry."
2023-11-07,"Title:Nope, Still No 'Gold Rush' at Record High Prices
Article:Gold investing net negative in bullion bars, ETFs, coins...


              
           


AFTER Covid, Russia invading Ukraine, the mini-crisis in US banking and now the awful news from Israel and Gaza, it's hard to deny that gold loves a crisis as the price makes another attempt to break and hold $2000, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             But contrary to any headlines claiming there's some kind of gold rush right now, profit-taking continues in physical bullion, and it's speculative betting in the Comex futures and options market which looks more likely to determine the direction of prices near term.
           

              
           

             That's because investing in physical gold was net negative as prices set new all-time highs last month, with people taking profits at the fastest pace in more than four years amid the dreadful violence in Israel and the ensuing bombardment and invasion of Gaza.
           

              
           




              
           

             Gold ended October with a new record-high monthly finish in US Dollars, up 6.8% at $1997 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             The UK gold price in Pound set a month-end record too, jumping 7.4% to £1645, while the Euro price added 6.5% to €1883 – also setting a new month-end record, as did gold in most other major currencies, including the Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen.
           

              
           

             Gold investors' response? The number of people choosing to buy gold across last month rose by 16.4% from 
            September's 4-year low on BullionVault, but the number of sellers jumped by 69.3%.
           

              
           

             That was the sharpest rise since and also reached the most since March, when the 'mini crisis' in regional US banking sent gold prices soaring towards new all-time highs. And together, those trades pushed the Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of actual trading behaviour among the world's largest single pool of private investors in physical precious metals – down by 1.4 points to 51.8, the lowest since January's 3.5-year low of 50.6.
           

              
           

             A reading of 50.0 would signal that the number of people starting or adding to their gold holdings across the month exactly matched the number reducing or selling all of their holdings. The 
            Gold Investor Index set a decade peak of 65.9 as the first-wave Covid crisis began in March 2020. It was last 
            below 50 in June 2019 with a reading of 49.1.
           

              
           

             In contrast to gold bullion, global stock markets in contrast lost 3.0% in Dollar terms across October, the third monthly fall in a row on the MSCI World Index. Major Western government bond prices also fell, with longer-dated US Treasury prices dropping 5.8% across the month.
           

              
           

             So once again, a crisis has sent gold prices soaring as other asset classes fall, confirming the precious metal's value as a form of financial insurance. But rather than rushing to buy gold, private investors as a group have used these latest record highs to take profit and rebalance their position overall.
           

              
           

             BullionVault users as a group sold 67.2% more gold than bought on average each day last month, with net selling totalling 470 kilograms in October, the heaviest one-month liquidation since June 2019 (775kg). 
           

              
           

             That cut the total quantity of gold now securely stored and insured in specialist, independent vaults in each client's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or (most popular) Zurich by 1.0% to the smallest since May 2022 at 47.4 tonnes, 1.5% below end-August's record high.
           

              
           

             Yet the value of those bullion holdings rose to new highs, up 5.7% in Dollar terms to $3.0 billion (up 6.4% to £2.5bn, up 5.5% to €2.8bn) and gold's 12-month average price has now risen above $1900 per Troy ounce for the first time ever, putting it on track for a fourth consecutive full-year annual average record.
           

              
           

             What about other physical bullion flows?
           

              
           

             Exchange-traded products tracking the price of gold have now shrunk for five months running, with liquidation in giant US 
            gold ETFs the GLD and IAU taking them to the smallest since the start of the Covid Catastrophe in early 2020.
           

              
           

             Coin stores across Europe and North America are meantime 
            glutted with second-hand product as their customers also sell at these all-time highs. New buyers remain few and far between thanks to cash-in-the-bank offering the highest interest rates for well over a decade.
           

              
           

             Yes, China's household gold demand is running strong, but that contrasts with India's subdued appetite at these prices ahead of the key Diwali festival. And while central banks continue supporting the gold price with record purchases for their bullion reserves (led again by the People's Bank of China), the real driver of October's rise through $2000 per Troy ounce was a 
            frantic turnaround in Comex gold derivatives trading.
           

              
           

             Hedge funds and other speculative players were caught short by Hamas' dreadful attack of 7th October. As a group, they then rushed to close out and get long, boosting their net bullish position in futures and options contracts at a near-record pace, inviting physical bullion investors to take profit.
           

              
           




              
           

             In contrast to gold, the Silver Investor Index rose in October, gaining 0.9 points to reach a four-month high of 51.6 as the price of the more industrially-useful precious metal edged just 0.5% higher against the Dollar to $23.30 per Troy ounce (up 1.3% in UK Pounds to £18.35, 0.1% in Euros to €21.78).
           

              
           

             Net of investor selling, BullionVault users added 3.0 tonnes to their silver holdings as a group, only the fifth monthly inflow of the last 12 months. That took the total quantity securely stored and insured in each client's choice of London, Singapore, Toronto and – most popular – Zurich up to 1,243.7 tonnes, higher by 0.2% from September's 15-month low.
           

              
           

             More widely, October's terror attacks in Israel and the ensuing invasion of Gaza saw the number of first-time investors in precious metals worldwide rise by 26.8% from September's figure at BullionVault, led by a 44.6% jump in the monthly count of new Eurozone users with the UK and USA lagging the global rebound with a rise of just 9.6% and 14.3% respectively.
           

              
           

             But that still left October's count of new precious metals investors worldwide running 30.6% behind the prior 12-month average, down 16.7% across the Eurozone, down 39.2% in the UK, and down 61.8% in the USA.
           

              
           

             Bottom line? Rising interest rates and record-high gold prices are combining to deter new investors in precious metals as existing investing positions are trimmed to rebalance. And contrary to what some headlines might claim, the awful news from the Middle East has not, as yet, overcome that drag on the investment bullion market."
2023-11-07,"Title:Gold Higher Despite Surging Bond Yields
Article:What drove gold's best October in 4 decades...?

 The GOLD PRICE rallied an incredible 7.3% in October to close at $1983 an ounce, its strongest October since 1978, when it jumped 11.7%, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 The price of gold had its best October in nearly half a century, defying tough resistance from surging Treasury yields and a strong US Dollar. The yellow metal rallied an incredible 7.3% last month to close at $1983 an ounce, its strongest October since 1978, when it jumped 11.7%.
 Gold, a non-interest-bearing asset, has historically floundered when bond yields were heading higher. An exception has been made this year, however, on a number of significant economic and geopolitical risks, including record-high national debt, rising credit card delinquencies, ongoing recession jitters (despite Jerome Powell's insistence that a recession is no longer in the Federal Reserve's forecasts) and two wars.
 If you believe these conditions will continue to spur investment demand for gold, now may be a good time to consider getting exposure (or adding to your exposure) in anticipation of potentially higher prices.
 A word of caution: The metal looks overbought right now based on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), so we may see some profit-taking in the short term. I believe strong support is being established, and if stocks recede, it may be an adequate catalyst for a gold rally. But keep in mind that, for the 30-year period, November has been the best month for stocks, with the S&P500 increasing an average of 1.96%, based on Bloomberg data.
 I recommend a gold weighting of no more than 10%, split evenly between physical bullion (bars, coins and jewelry) and high-quality gold mining stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. Remember to rebalance at least once a year, if not more frequently.
 If you're still on the fence, take a look at what the official sector has been up to. Central banks bought a collective 337 tonnes of gold in the third quarter, marking the second-largest third quarter on record, according to the latest report by the World Gold Council (WGC). Year-to-date, banks have added a remarkable 800 tonnes, which is 14% more than they added during the same nine months last year.
 The list of biggest buyers during the third quarter was dominated by emerging markets as countries continue to diversify away from the US Dollar. In the top spot was China, which added a massive 78 metric tonnes of gold, followed by Poland (over 56 tonnes) and Turkey (39 tonnes).
 I often advise investors to pay attention to what central banks do rather than what they say, but they're occasionally on point and worth listening to.
 During last month's press conference, for example, National Bank of Poland (NBP) president Adam Glapiński said that the Eastern European country would continue to buy gold, which ""makes Poland a more credible country."" The goal is for gold to be 20% of Poland's total foreign reserves. As of September, gold accounted for 11.2% of its holdings, according to WGC data.
 Take a look also at Japan. The country hasn't traditionally been a big importer of gold, but Japanese investors and households in general have lately bid up the price of the yellow metal to a new all-time high of ¥300,000. That's a substantial difference from the 30-year average price of just under ¥100,000.
 In the medium to near term, Japan's gold rush has been triggered primarily by the Yen's historic slide against the US Dollar, prompting investors to seek a hedge against inflation.
 In an attempt to rein in rising consumer prices, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has introduced a ¥17 trillion ($113 billion) stimulus package that, among other things, makes temporary cuts to income and residential taxes, assistance to low-income households and gasoline and utility subsidies.
 But as many of you are aware, money-printing by world governments, especially during the pandemic, is largely to blame for the current spate of inflation that has cut deeply into consumers' pocketbooks around the globe. A $113 billion spending plan at this time will act as fuel on a bonfire.
 Japanese households appear to understand this, as their approval of Kishida's job as prime minister has slipped to an all-time low rating of 33%, according to recent polling by Nikkei and Tokyo TV. When asked about the potential tax cuts, a whopping 65% of participants said that they're an inappropriate response to high inflation.
 A better strategy, I believe, is with gold and gold mining equities. As the WGC has shown multiple times, gold has typically fared well during periods of high inflation. Historically, when inflation rates have exceeded 3% – which is where we are today – the average price of gold rose 14%.
 For the 12-month period as of Friday, gold in Dollar terms is up 22%, which beats the S&P500 (up 19% over the same period) and is well above inflation."

 'DE-DOLLARIZATION' touts about the US Dollar should regenerate if Uncle Buck loses the base breakout and bull traps, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 The US Dollar index has been asking the question ""bull trap?"" since well before it actually broke above the March high, to create said potential.
 Well actually, your friendly NFTRH blogger has been asking the question. That is because we had anticipated a potentially strong rally off of the false breakdown in July which included much chanting about the BRICS and de-Dollarization.
 The de-Dollarizers got bear trapped and now the poetic outcome would be a bull trap.
 Just last week USD bear trapped upward out of a bull flag and this week lost that flag breakout, which is a bearish omen, short-term. From an NFTRH+ update yesterday:
 ""USD's bull flag is getting thumped and the question 'bull trap?' is still a valid one. The pattern continues to favor 'bullish consolidation' as long as it holds the SMA 50, but the looks of RSI and MACD indicate a southern exposure.""
 If Uncle Buck makes a bull trap and declines there is much more to the story. I'll leave that for NFTRH to manage, but here is a hint:
 If at some lower level you hear the De-Dollarization chants start to reverberate loudly, have some caution. The bear trap scenario is only indicated to be a breakout failure and little more at this time.
 Beyond seasonal market rallies, the global counter-party is expected to find a liquidity bid in the coming months."
2023-11-05,"Title:Another Bank Down. Could CBDC Fix It?
Article:Sixth US bank fails this year...

 CITIZENS BANK was a small bank in Iowa with about $66 million in assets, says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.
 Its loan portfolio consisted largely of commercial and industrial loans. And last month the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that Citizens Bank had failed due to significant hidden loan losses totaling about $15 million.
 Because Citizens Bank was not a member of FDIC, the bank's losses will be the responsibility of the state of Iowa.
 This is the sixth notable bank failure this year. As you might recall, the first five were Silicon Valley Bank (back in March), Silvergate Bank (a bridge from the crypto world), Signature Bank (another crypto conduit to the regular banking world), First Republic Bank and the giant Credit Suisse.
 I warned in March that the failure of Silicon Valley Bank would be just the start. Now we've had five additional bank failures.
 And this latest failure won't be the last.
 Veterans of such crises (and I include myself in that category) know that once the dominoes start falling, they keep falling until some government intervention of a particularly draconian kind is imposed.
 We've seen some significant regulatory actions from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the US Treasury and the Swiss National Bank, but the fixes have been temporary and followed quickly by new failures.
 The FDIC abandoned its $250,000 deposit insurance limit and effectively guaranteed all the depositors in Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, a guarantee of over $200 billion in deposits. This has impacted the FDIC insurance fund and required higher insurance premiums from solvent banks, the cost of which is ultimately borne by consumers (you).
 The Federal Reserve went further and offered to lend money at par for any government securities tendered as collateral by member banks even if the collateral was worth only 80% or 90% of par. These collateralized loans are financed with newly printed money, which might exceed $1 trillion.
 These actions have thrown the US banking system and bank depositors into utter confusion. Are all bank deposits now insured or just the ones Janet Yellen decides are ""systemically important""? What's the basis for that decision? What about the fact that unrealized losses on US bank portfolios of government securities now exceed $700 billion?
 If those losses are realized to provide cash to fleeing depositors, it could wipe out much of the capital of the banking system.
 Unrealized losses on securities held by FDIC-insured banks exceed $620 billion. That's the amount of bank capital that would be wiped out if the banks were forced to sell those securities to meet demands from depositors who wanted their money back.
 That would cause additional bank failures and continue the panic that began in March indefinitely.
 We're not out of the woods, and the confusion will continue.
 What's important to bear in mind is that crises of this type are not over in days or weeks.
 A slow-motion rolling panic that takes a year or longer is more typical.
 The 1998 crisis reached the acute stage on Sept. 28, 1998, just before the rescue of LTCM. We were hours away from the sequential shutdown of every stock and bond exchange in the world.
 But that crisis began in June 1997 with the devaluation of the Thai baht and massive capital flight from Asia and then Russia. It took 15 months to go from a serious crisis to an existential threat.
 Likewise, the 2008 crisis reached the acute stage on Sept. 15, 2008, with the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Bros. But that crisis began in the spring of 2007 when HSBC surprised markets with an announcement that mortgage losses had exceeded expectations.
 It then continued through the summer of 2007 with the failures of two Bear Steans high-yield mortgage funds, and the closure of a Société Générale money market fund. The panic then caused the failures of Bear Stearns (March 2008), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (June 2008) and other institutions before reaching Lehman Bros.
 For that matter, the panic continued after Lehman to include AIG, General Electric, the commercial paper market and General Motors before finally subsiding on March 9, 2009. Starting with the HSBC announcement, the subprime mortgage panic and domino effects lasted 24 months from March 2007 to March 2009.
 Averaging our two examples (1998, 2008) the average duration of these financial crises is about 20 months. Since this crisis began in March (eight months ago), it could have a long way to run.
 In other words, crises can unfold for a long time before they're finally squashed by massive regulatory intervention.
 Get ready for more bank failures.
 I've written a lot about what I call Biden Bucks. That's my term for the central bank digital currency (CBDC) the government is currently preparing.
 What does the ongoing banking crisis have to do with Biden Bucks? Well, plenty, as it turns out.
 Whether an account is in CBDC or a regular checking account doesn't make that much difference. Bank runs today are no different than in the 1930s from a behavioral perspective.
 It's all about lost confidence, fear, not wanting to be the last person out of a burning building, rumors, word of mouth and a host of psychological factors that are part of human nature.
 That part hasn't changed since at least the 14th century with the failure of the Bardi and Peruzzi banks around 1345. What has changed is technology. Marshall McLuhan said in the 1960s that in the global village, everyone knows everything at the same time. He was right. That means when a bank run begins, there's an immediate reaction.
 The difference with the 1930s is that you don't line up around the corner and wait for the chance to demand cash from the teller. You take out your iPhone, make a few taps and, whether it's Venmo or a wire transfer, the money is on its way out the door.
 Whether you're a retail depositor with $1000 or a maven with $8 billion, everyone was online moving money all at once. In that sense, CBDCs don't matter much. Whether it's CBDC, Venmo, wire transfer or cash from an ATM, everyone is cashing out at the same time via digital channels. But there is one huge impact of CBDCs that is entirely new and sets them apart from what's described above...
 CBDCs are programmable and controlled by the government.
 This means when a run develops, the government can stop the run just by freezing CBDC account transfers. They can even claw back earlier transfers. Since the government controls the CBDC ledger, they can see where the early withdrawals went and simply reinstate them on the account of the failing bank and debit them from the accounts of the transferees. The government can do this with a few keystrokes because they see everything.
 This means that once Biden Bucks is implemented, you're locked into a system controlled by the government. You're in a money jail.
 There's no point even starting a bank run because the government can track your movements and put the money back where it started. It's one of many ways that Biden Bucks gives the government total control of your money and can monitor your thoughts and movements.
 Cash is likely to be eliminated sooner rather than later in order to pave the way for the dominance of central bank digital currencies. A US Dollar CBDC is coming soon. Cash will have to be eliminated to force individuals into the CBDC world. For better or worse, the only way citizens will be able to avoid the mandatory use of CBDCs will be to use gold, silver or cryptocurrencies.
 I put comparisons of gold (and silver) and Bitcoin in the same category as comparing fish and bicycles. You can do it, but what's the point? Gold is money and Bitcoin is a hallucinogen;(or more precisely an acoustic hypnotic spell).
 The idea that the US Treasury, Fed and other mainstream monetary institutions are hostile to crypto is absolutely correct. For 10 years they have taken the view that they don't like it but don't know what to do about it. Now they know.
 The solution is to kill it.
 Of course, Bitcoin and other cryptos have their own ecosystem of exchanges, derivatives, custodians, payment channels, tickers, etc., etc. But so what? Cryptos are like chips in a casino.
 You can make money or lose money gambling with the chips. But if you walk outside with chips in your pocket, they're worthless.
 You can change tables at the casino but you can't leave the casino. Chips only have value inside. If you want to spend money outside, you have to visit the cashier first to cash in your chips. The cashier is the portal from the crypto world to the real world of money.
 That's why the FDIC took over Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12, when they shut down Silicon Valley Bank. Signature Bank was no worse off than a lot of other banks. If it had survived until Monday, March 13, it would have been rescued by the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) along with the entire US banking system. Why did Signature Bank get whacked under those circumstances?
 Signature Bank got whacked because it was offering a portal to the crypto world called Signet. Once the FDIC announced a blanket deposit guarantee and the Fed offered an unlimited ability to swap bonds for cash at par, Signature would have been fine like any other bank.
 Yellen used a panicked weekend to wipe out the Signet portal. As Rahm Emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste. This is one example of how crypto is getting strangled globally. CBDCs are being set up to replace cryptos as a digital currency.
 As for gold, you can manipulate the price for short periods of time by dumping gold, painting the tape, acting in concert, etc. But those techniques are not sustainable (unless you want to sell all your gold, in which case you end up with no gold and the market still goes its way).
 The London Gold Pool price rigging agreement collapsed in 1968. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown sold almost half of the UK's gold in 1999 at a near 20-year low, a notorious effort at price manipulation known as Brown's Bottom.
 Both are good examples of how manipulation always fails in the end. The government could try a replay of FDR's gold confiscation from 1933, but it won't work this time because there's no trust in the government's promises.
 There are many reasons for this. No one trusts the government today, whereas in 1933 there was a belief that FDR knew what he was doing and was trying to end the Great Depression. COVID is a good example of how people were lied to about vaccines, masks, etc.
 The rule today is ""Don't get fooled again."" No one will surrender their gold except perhaps the people still wearing masks. But they probably don't have any gold to begin with.
 The other reason gold confiscation won't work is that gold is not fixed in price as it was in 1933. Very few saw the Dollar devaluation from $20 per ounce to $35 per ounce of gold coming that FDR orchestrated in 1933.
 That gold price increase (really a Dollar devaluation) wasn't announced until months after the confiscation. It was the ultimate in insider trading organized by FDR. Informed citizens won't fall for that a second time.
 In a non-pegged market as we have today, the crisis will come first and gold will go to $5,000 or $10,000 per ounce or higher before the government gets around to an attempted confiscation. By that point the damage is done and gold owners have their winnings.
 How should everyday Americans evaluate the crisis choice between gold and cryptos as alternatives to the Dollar? Ask the following questions:
 Can crypto get whacked by governments? Yes. Can gold be manipulated in the long-run? No.
 Those questions and answers really answer the bigger question of how to survive the collapse of the Dollar.
 Gold works. Crypto doesn't. 'Nuff said."
2023-11-01,"Title:What Oil Means for Gold Mining Stocks
Article:Tracking the GOR against the GDX...


              
           


GOLD MINING stock charts have not yet confirmed a sustainable rally, and current fundamentals may be a headwind, 
            says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.


              
           

             We have used this daily chart of the gold stock ETF (GDX) in written and video updates to keep NFTRH subscribers apprised of the progress of the bounce from the early October low (after previously using the chart to manage the long correction that began with the May double top).
           

              
           




              
           

             The sentiment and oversold conditions at the early October low were powerful enough to spring a strong rebound or even to end the bear phase in force since May. The break above the top of the falling wedge on the chart above was a positive, as a falling wedge in this case is a massive bull flag. However, I regard falling and rising wedges among the less reliable patterns in TA. So there's your caveat.
           

              
           

             On the plus side, the Gold Miners Bullish Percent Index shows a still deeply oversold condition. When the BPGDM 20-month EMA hits lows – as it did a few weeks ago – it tends to spring back much harder than it has currently. This implies that there is more fuel to the rally from this perspective.
           

              
           




              
           

             There are a couple concerning signals in play that will remain proprietary to NFTRH. But here is one that conventional gold mining analysts should be considering. We first noted it in NFTRH a few weeks ago.
           

              
           

             The Gold/Oil ratio (GOR) was negative for the entirety of the Q3 period that is about to be reported this earnings season. Crude Oil/Energy is a large factor in mining costs and the miners' product under-performed in Q3. The questions now are...
           

 To what degree does the ratio impact the miners' bottom lines and has the impact been factored?
 Will the market be smart enough to look ahead, rather than react to what is already behind?


             If the market is looking ahead it sees the GOR breaking the downtrend and turning up. The GOR is not nearly a comprehensive fundamental indicator for gold mining stocks. But it is a very primary one, and if this breakout continues mining operational fundamentals will improve nicely.
           

              
           




              
           

             As the technical situation stalls where it is supposed to stall, a still deeply depressed sector is not carrying much froth, which is contrary positive. The short-term technical situation is stalled after all, not broken.
           

              
           

             However, the sector has been fairly 'anti-USD' and painted more often than not with the brush that paints commodities. Again, we are managing signals in play that are concerning for the anti-USD/inflation trades. But for the purposes of this article, note that the techncials are at a decision point while the fundamentals (including and beyond the GOR) make moves to improve.
           

              
           

             When viewing the macro funda, there is a whole range of items that need to be considered and factored, which we do in weekly reports and NFTRH+ updates. That said, watch this earnings season closely.
           

              
           

             If the sector bulls (first objective: take out the SMA 200 on GDX) it could be looking ahead to the improving macro I see for 2024, and if it puts on a final decline – and the fundamentals continue to improve – we'll have a table pounder of a buying opportunity. That opportunity would come at the expense of those who've been guided by, and acted upon improper fundamental analysis not only since 2020, but on the long inflationary phase from 2003 to 2023.
           

              
           

             To the surprise of most, the gold mining sector will become something special only when the Inflation > Disinflation/Goldilocks progression we are currently experiencing morphs to a deflation scare. And if the Fed's hands are still tied and it cannot or will not effectively commit inflationary bailouts of bubble assets once again, so much the better for the long-term health of the gold mining sector."

Article:Comex bulls got gold to $2000. Central banks and festive buying to support... 


              
           


IS THIS new touch of $2000 gold for real? 
            asks Adrian Ash at BullionVault in this note first shared with readers of the Weekly Update
             email on Monday.


              
           

             I mean, will it stick this time?
           

              
           

             Sure, gold has already made fresh record highs in Euros, UK Pounds, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and most other currencies since Friday evening's big surge.
           

              
           

             And there is no such thing as a triple top...
           

              
           

             ...not 
            according to lots of technical analysts back when the Dollar 
            gold price pushed above $2000 per ounce for the 3rd time in history this spring.
           

              
           

Gold first got to $2000 amid Covid and the first-wave catastrophe of 2020. Then 
            $2000 gold came on Russia invading Ukraine in early 2022...
           

              
           

             ...followed by 
            $2000 gold on spring 2023's mini banking crisis...
           

              
           

             ...and now we're here again as Israel's army 
            flattens northern Gaza to hunt down the murderers, rapists and kidnappers of 7th October...
           

              
           

             ...with the US Navy sailing alongside as 
            Iran-backed forces attack Uncle Sam elsewhere in the Middle East.
           

              
           




              
           

             Yes, gold bulls would appear to love misery and death. The 'ghoulish' tag is hard to deny when the chart looks like this. 
           

              
           

             And no, there's no reason to think $2000 will act as a hard ceiling for gold prices just because it has tried and failed to hold above that level 3 times already.
           

              
           

             Right now however, long-time pundits and analysts would point to 3 things:
           

              
           

             First, silver isn't following, let alone leading, and the cheaper metal tends to amplify the moves in gold when the yellow metal is enjoying a deep and sustained move higher.
           

              
           

             Second, gold mining stocks are also lagging the yellow metal. Again, that says real money is shy of gold's long-term prospects right now.
           

              
           




              
           

             The HUI index has risen 15.4% over the last 12 months, but gold itself is up 17.7% in Dollar terms, and Friday's pop in mining share prices still leaves the sector over 5% lower for 2023-to-date right now.
           

              
           

             Third, and to repeat and repeat, no one is buying bullion. Not net of selling. No one that anyone can see.
           

              
           

             ""Gold is overbought in Dollar terms on the [relative strength index] and getting that way on the Bollinger basis,"" says long-time bullion analyst Rhona O'Connell, now at brokerage StoneX, studying her charts.
           

              
           

             ""Definitely overbought in Swiss, Yen and Euro terms. And very much so in Thai Baht and Korean Won, so I'd expect physical to be coming back from those areas.""
           

              
           

             Physical metal is certainly coming back to market from BullionVault users...
           

              
           

             ...net sellers as a group overall of £1 million per day in gold on average so far this month.
           

              
           

             Gold continues to bleed back into the market from gold coin-and-bar owners as well.
           

              
           

             ""With these high prices, goods come back to the market,"" says one German retailer. ""That's why there is 
            still a lot of cheap product available at the moment.""
           

              
           

             Cheap is, of course, a relative word for retail bar and coin customers when they're paying 5% above spot to buy and facing 4% discounts when they sell, digging into the profits they might be hoping to take and switch into cash-in-the-bank, now offering something close to an inflation-matching rate of interest for the first time since the global financial crisis.
           

              
           

             Shareholders in 
            gold-backed ETF trust funds also continue to head for the exits as well. And as with the 2023 drop in coin and small-bar demand, this trend didn't need murder and mayhem in the Middle East to get rolling.
           

              
           




              
           

             The giant GLD and IAU products listed in New York ended Friday with their 8th and 14th consecutive week of net liquidation respectively...
           

              
           

             ...shrinking their combined size by almost 30% from the joint top of September 2020, the immediate aftermath of gold's first peep above $2000 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             Germany's Xetra Gold ETC has meanwhile shrunk by another 1.3% so far in October, down to its smallest size since February 2021 and shrinking by 1/10th from spring 2022's all-time peak...
           

              
           

             ...and the London stock market's 2 largest gold-backed trust fund products have meantime shrunk to their smallest since April 2021, down by more than 1/5th from their combined peak of April 2022.
           

              
           

             Put another way, the ghouls of gold aren't to be found among BullionVault users, coin-and-bar consumers, or ETF traders.
           

              
           

             So who's buying hand-over-fist to drive $2000 gold?
           

              
           

             Like Rhona O'Connell suggests above, Asian households aren't likely leading this move.
           

              
           

             Gold near $2000 was 
            already denting the run-up to Diwali in India, typically the No.2 gold consumer market's biggest gold-buying season, before this latest price pop.
           

              
           

             Some households in China 
            are also rushing to cash in, at least with any old or broken bits of jewellery they can find according to the 
            South China Morning Post, even as others continue to buy new bars and bullion jewellery at today's record-high prices. 
           

              
           

             And why not? China's domestic gold price has risen by more than 21% in Yuan terms from this time last year. That makes it the only bull-market in town both for profit-takers and for new investment inflows.
           

              
           

             Productive demand for gold meantime 
            continues to shrink as a proportion of the market, now decisively below the 10% share which it used to enjoy when the rise of the microchip met what was left of dental demand for gold fillings.
           

              
           

             That leaves, like we keep saying, the unusual suspects of 
            central-bank gold buyers, led by China, India, Singapore and Thailand over the last 3 years.
           

              
           

             Central banks already took their net gold demand as a group up to record levels in 2022, and 2023 looks very likely to top it on 
            best estimates for the gold demand which those hoarders do not deign to report.
           

              
           

             But really, today? Or over the past 3 weeks? Honestly, do the state-employed national asset managers of Beijing, New Delhi, Shenton Way and Bangkok present the most likely suspects for rushing to bid up gold to new record highs even as they try to grow their bullion holdings for 
            long-term security, stability and diversification? 
           

              
           

             I doubt it. Not compared to this lot.
           

              
           




              
           

             See the blue circle, top right?
           

              
           

             It highlights the 2nd highest figure ever for the red line. And that red line tracks how over-excited the hot money has got in gold, betting on prices rather than actually paying those prices to buy any gold.
           

              
           

             Look, as we noted in last week's 
            Update, something very odd happened in the gold derivatives market in the immediate aftermath of Hamas' vile atrocities in Israel.
           

              
           

             Speculative traders – better known as 'Managed Money' by US regulator the CFTC, which collects the data on trader positioning each Tuesday – actually grew their net bearish position from the week before using Comex futures and options.
           

              
           

             In other words, the hot money was betting that gold prices would fall.
           

              
           

             But since then, the ghouls of gold have reverted to type, cutting their bearish bets and hiking their bullish bets as a group. And that move has been so rapid, it's flipped the Managed Money category from net bearish to solidly bullish.
           

              
           

             More dramatically, it has added 328 tonnes of notional gold to their net position overall (red line, right-hand axis above)...
           

              
           

             ...the fastest 2-week rise ever outside of mid-2019's sudden spike, when the world and her husband suddenly decided the Fed would start slashing US interest rates amid a US recession which would drive gold prices higher.
           

              
           

             Remember, this isn't even make-believe gold. No one betting on the gold price via the futures market wants to own physical bullion. They would just go and buy it if they did (say, using BullionVault to keep their costs low and their 24/7 access unbeatable, like their physical security).
           

              
           

             No, what these speculators want instead is to bet $1 for the chance of a $10 gain if things run their way. And after the Managed Money was caught short when gold prices started to jump following the horrors of 7th October, it has now rushed to get long...
           

              
           

             ...and it's rushed faster than any time on record outside mid-2019.
           

              
           

             Maybe they're right. Maybe gold will keep pushing higher, rising and holding above $2000 per Troy ounce. But if so, then actual gold buyers will at some point need to start swallowing and stop selling the steep cost jump of the last 2 weeks...
           

              
           

             ...now pricing gold 10% higher in US Dollar terms and up at fresh record highs in most other currencies.
           

              
           

             Could that happen? Yes of course it could. And it very well might.
           

              
           

             How else do you think gold went from $250 back in 2001 up to $2000 today?
           

              
           

             Gold's big jumps always spook jewellery consumers, and they invite profit-taking among physical traders and investors too.
           

              
           

             But the underlying uptrend in gold started long before Hamas' terrorists broke into southern Israel. And it has always needed...and always got...buyers to come in eventually, whether on a pullback or on swallowing their desire for a dip.
           

              
           

             All this said, the stars aren't classically aligned for gold to run and run, not on the 'old hands' criteria at the top.
           

              
           

             Maybe silver and the HUI will suddenly catch up, or maybe something is different this time. But it also needs noting that the $2000 handle clearly represents a big psychological level for the global gold market to accept. To date it has rejected it 3 times.
           

              
           

             Gold's floor since the last attempt in April-May this year, however, came in much higher than it had come in following the 2 previous tops. The floor rose even though demand from Western private investors was much lower and then turned outright negative.
           

              
           

             So to repeat: Central banks are playing a huge part in this, as pretty much everyone I spoke to about it agreed at 
            this month's LBMA conference. And this time, gold $2000 has come as the world runs into the key Diwali-Christmas-Chinese-New-Year period.
           

              
           

             Yes, the recent price surge will hurt tonnage demand among those consumers. But many private households MUST buy some gold during this period, whatever the price. And as gold turns to face 2024, history says that if this attempt above $2000 doesn't quite hold, those consumers are sure to buy the hell out of any dip, bringing the floor higher again as the global gold market gets used to higher ground once more."

Article:Invest in things you can control...


              
           


I WOULD summarize the economic flow of recent events like this, 
            says Charles Hugh Smith on his OfTwoMinds blog in this article re-posted on Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             2020-21: massive stimulus and pandemic restrictions build up household savings and generate a stock market ""meme stock"" bubble.
           

              
           

             Mid-2021-22: ""Revenge Spending"" splurging generates massive spike in consumption, profiteering and inflation.
           

              
           

             2023: Renewed bubbles in housing and stocks, a classic ""rebound/echo"" bubble. Splurging wanes as savings and credit are tapped out, and higher interest rates finally start affecting behavior.
           

              
           

             2024: Forced frugality as jobs are slashed, profits fall, inflation stays sticky, credit dries up, businesses close, Federal Reserve stimulus wanes and soaring government borrowing costs crimps government spending.
           

              
           

             I've often discussed that the economy and society are cyclical. Nothing stays on the same trajectory forever.
           

              
           

             History shows that when prices rise sharply, they rarely return to their previous levels as participants quickly habituate to the higher costs. Taxes, fees, rents, etc. rarely decline. Owners will keep prices high until they go broke rather than lower prices, as their own costs are also sticky.
           

              
           

             So what's the best way to reduce the risks of forced frugality manifesting as recession/depression that affects us?
           

              
           

             I've written a book on self-reliance. My approach to self-reliance is to differentiate it from self-sufficiency by focusing on:
           

 Lowering our exposure to the risks created by deglobalization, definancialization, instability and forced frugality;
 Taking control of our resources/assets rather than leaving them exposed to the excesses/errors of asset managers, the Federal Reserve, politicians, etc.


             These are of course related: by taking control of our skills/resources/assets, we're accepting responsibility for their management, and the responsibility of lowering the risks of our assets being impaired by events outside our control.
           

              
           

             The basics of lowering risk are common-sense:
           

 Lower expenses, needs, expectations, obligations: it's easier to get enough of whatever you need if you need very little.
 Eliminate debt: Uncertainties abound in our net income, but debt payments are certainties. Fewer bad things can happen to us if we're debt-free.
 Have plans in place to respond to much more severe challenges / crises than the mainstream reckons are possible.
 Avoid relying on speculative gains to provide income and security: easy come, easy go.


             The status quo is optimized to function at a low simmer. There are only a handful of first responders and minimal resources available at any one time, and limited institutional know-how to deal with crises that overwhelm the narrow boundaries of ""normal"" consumption, supply chains, etc.
           

              
           

             The wind-driven firestorm that consumed Lahaina on Maui is a tragic example of how thin resources are spread, and how they're optimized for conventional risks (for example, a single building on fire).
           

              
           

             The immediate overwhelming of response resources is only the first domino. All the follow-on responses are equally ill-equipped for any contingency above a low-level event, or series of events.
           

              
           

             Consider the limited staff and capabilities of the Maui County planning and building permits department. How is this small staff and limited system going to issue permits for the 1,900 structures that were destroyed?
           

              
           

             Even the capacity of larger regions is quickly overwhelmed by even a blip in permit demand. The Malibu (California) fire in 2018 burned 600 residences to the ground, and five years later, fewer than 300 homes have been built or permitted. Bureaucratic inertia and over-regulation are factors that there are few incentives to overcome.
           

              
           

             600 homes is a tiny blip of signal noise in the vast megalopolis of LA. Yet even this insignificant number has fatally log-jammed the status quo.
           

              
           

             Households, businesses, institutions and government agencies are no longer very resilient. The vast majority depend on global supply chains and services performed by others for virtually everything. Once those break down or are overwhelmed, the majority are helpless as they have few real-world skills, few planned responses and few real-world resources.
           

              
           

             As I have often noted, many locales are highly vulnerable to disruption because they're almost totally dependent on long global supply chains for essentials as they lack local sources. Moving out of such locales to places with at least some local resources (water, energy, food, manufacturing, etc) and a cultural-social memory (values and connections) of self-reliance, self-help, community and sharing reduces risks and increases our options for influencing what happens to us.
           

              
           

             I have long held that the ""bug-out cabin"" is not a resilient option. Self-reliance is much better served by becoming a useful member of a productive, trustworthy network of productive people and local enterprises in a functioning community.
           

              
           

             Diversifying our assets is the basic strategy to reducing risk. Much of the investment field is aimed at the top 10% who own most of the financial wealth, so ""diversification"" means distributing a large nest egg of wealth into conventional ""boxes"": some in precious metals, some in income-producing real estate, some in dividend-paying stocks, some in bonds, etc.
           

              
           

             The problem with this approach is two-fold:
           

 Not every household has a large nest egg of financial wealth that can be divvied up in passive investments.
 All of these passive asset classes could be disrupted by authorities responding to financial/economic crises. Precious metals, stocks and bonds could be restricted, frozen, heavily taxed or expropriated by one means or another, and rental real estate could be restricted by rent control.


             Authorities have few limits on their responses, and their desperation to keep the status quo glued together by whatever means are at hand will be near-infinite.
           

              
           

             Many such options are time-tested and legal. A ""windfall tax"" on profits and capital gains is legal, for example, and there are no upper limits on such ""special levies"". Local authorities can forcibly acquire property via eminent domain, and should real estate valuations plummet, the ""fair value"" paid for the property might be minimal.
           

              
           

             The wealthy will have targets on their back, as the bottom 90% will support ""wealth taxes"" because they won't have to pay them. The authorities will leave assets the majority own (the family house) alone to avoid the risk of political blowback/disorder.
           

              
           

             The top 10% are the natural target as they 1) own 90% of the income-producing wealth 2) are a minority and 3) politically vulnerable to charges of rigging the system to their own benefit.
           

              
           

             Not all assets are of equal utility. A house will continue to have utility as shelter regardless of its market value. It doesn't matter if the house is worth $1,000 or $1 million if it's owned debt-free and provides shelter.
           

              
           

             Not all assets generate income we can actually control. Renting out a studio or room in our house is unlikely to face much regulatory risk, and we control who we rent to and under what conditions. In previous eras, taking boarders was a common path to generating income for widows who had lost their husbands and their income.
           

              
           

             The core concept here is that if you have few resources or assets, invest them in an enterprise you own and control that has the potential to generate more income than passive investments.
           

              
           

             For example, the capital gains/income potential of $5,000 invested passively in precious metals, bonds or stocks is negligible. But this modest sum could go a long way in setting up an enterprise based on skills, networking, etc – ie, an enterprise whose value is generated not by the sum invested but by the skills and social capital leveraged by the modest financial investment.
           

              
           

             One of the points of my book on self-reliance is to highlight the lack of basic life skills in today's populace when compared to the populace in Emerson's time (1840s). I admit to being stunned by how many people do not know how to change the oil in their car, make minimal mechanical repairs, nurture plants/trees, do basic home repairs, or prepare simple, real-food meals from scratch.
           

              
           

             In an economy optimized for efficiency and profitability, tasks are segmented and specialized. Jobs where we're paid for having a spectrum of broad-based skills are rare. We're paid to be specialists, and encouraged to pay other specialists to do everything for us.
           

              
           

             Many people are finding it difficult to find a handyperson who can do a variety of small repairs. Those who are available are often overbooked and pricey. I've heard some online sources claiming a handyperson can make $1,000 a day. Even if that overstates reality, the trajectory is clear: the number of people with a broad range of skills is narrow, and further narrowed to those willing to put up with all the hassles of running an enterprise and dealing with customers.
           

              
           

             In an era where risks are multiplying and hard to assess, optimizing our lives for broad-based life skills, zero-debt, direct control of our assets, and becoming valued contributing members of networks of productive, trustworthy people will lower our exposure to risk and increase our security.
           

              
           

             If the status quo manages to continue on its present course, none of these strategies reduce our enjoyment. Reducing risk by adding skills and enterprise works just as well in good times. If things unravel, these risk-reduction strategies quickly shift from ""nice to have"" to ""essential."" But by then, it will be too late to put them in place.

2023-10-29,"Title:High Yields vs. Gold: Why Hasn't the Price Sunk?
Article:Yield curve steepener continues, gold price strong...


              
           


MANY have questioned why the gold price has failed to do the normal thing,
             writes Gary Tanashian.


              
           

             That normal thing being to decline significantly in the face of high 'real' yields – themselves an indication of very tight monetary policy...
           

              
           




              
           

             Further, the gold price has held up despite muted High Yield spreads (implying intact risk 'on' investor behavior), despite the intact Goldilocks phase (inflation cooling, but not too cool) that has benefited the US Dollar and the stock market in 2023, and other signals typically negative for gold.
           

              
           

             Assuming that the war input (never a healthy reason to be long-term bullish on gold) is limited, since gold was in a normal and healthy correction (but well above what the macro signals would normally imply) before the disaster in Israel and Gaza erupted, we might simply assign the golden anomalies in play now to the fact that it's a new macro with new rules.
           

              
           

             Here again is my favorite picture of a new macro beckoning new rules. In NFTRH 779 we began a process of defining the possibilities in play by the implications of this chart. That will have to remain proprietary to NFTRH, but my jaw dropped a little when considering the sheer beauty and symmetry in play.
           

              
           

             It has to do with the differences in inflation/deflation dynamics before something broke (2022 spike above the monthly moving averages in the 30-year Treasury bond yield continuum) and today, in the aftermath and birth of the new macro.
           

              
           




              
           

             But the main point is that something changed profoundly and if you're following the playbook of 2000-2022, that is akin to following Bill Belichick and his obsoleted coaching style (and/or roster construction philosophy) vs. today's NFL.
           

              
           

             Interestingly, the New England Patriots dynasty began the year the great inflationary Maestro, Alan Greenspan, kicked the age of 'Inflation onDemand' into gear in 2001 and ended the day Tom Brady walked out the door, soon to be followed by the old macro door closing and a new one opening.
           

              
           

             One indication that will likely turn out to be a tail wind to the gold price is the yield curve; in this case the 10yr-2yr yield curve. The curve has done as we'd projected after the secondary inversion extreme and is now ticking new cycle highs and soon an undoing of the inverted state.
           

              
           




              
           

             Why does a yield curve steepener favor gold?
           

              
           

             Well first off, let's review the fact that a steepening yield curve can come under deflationary pressure, or inflationary pressure, or both over the course of an extended steepener.
           

              
           

             As an example, the run up to the 2008 deflationary liquidation featured a steepening curve in 2007-2008 that began inflationary and resolved deflationary.
           

              
           

             A steepening yield curve under deflationary pressure implies that markets are going risk 'off', seeking liquidity of short-term cash equivalents over speculation in long-term debt instruments. Gold is favored in relation to risk assets like stocks, commodities and even silver as its monetary aspects come into play as a safe haven.
           

              
           

             This safe haven can eventually turn into a play on the gold price as well, when markets get a whiff of dovishness emanating from policymakers' various orifices. But the main feature is that the 'real' price of gold, as measured in a spectrum of risk assets, would rise and likely rise hard regardless of whether or not the nominal gold price is rising.
           

              
           

             The above also happens to be THE investment case for gold mining stocks. Listen to analysis claiming China, rising oil prices, inflation and war are positives for gold stocks if you will. But it is wrong and it's no wonder legions of gold bugs have been perma-wrong while making excuses about wrong-doing from our overlords or whatever.
           

              
           

             When gold rises vs. risk assets like stocks and mining costs like oil and materials, the fundamental picture will improve and the miners will do what they have not done over the last 20 years; leverage the gold price in a positive manner. See last week's As the New Macro Engages, Gold Stocks to Shine for a compelling picture of the HUI/Gold ratio juxtaposed against the new macro.
           

              
           

             The deflationary view is the favored dominant view for the new steepener. Right now the steepener is signaled to be under inflationary pressure with nominal yields rising, but when nominal yields top out the curve will be likely to continue steepening under deflationary pressure because risk asset prices will be tanking.
           

              
           

             ""Signaled to be under inflationary pressure"" does not mean inflationary pressure is building in this case. We have documented all along since projecting a broad recovery in Q4, 2022 that inflationary pressures would wane, and they have done just that. Don Quixote is tilting at his inflationary windmill for other reasons, in my opinion. Like perhaps a Federal Government that refuses to muzzle itself and stop its sublime levels of debt spending.
           

              
           

             A steepening yield curve under inflationary pressure would theoretically paint the Fed as behind the curve. But of course, the Fed is currently tight...VERY tight, as the 3 month T-bill continues to diverge the 2yr yield as it has prior to previous bear markets in stocks. This divergence should eventually crack the stock market into a bear market.
           

              
           




              
           

             The very fact that the Fed appears intent on cracking inflated asset markets implies that an inflationary yield curve steepener is way out on the horizon. But no matter the mix of deflationary and inflationary pressure on the yield curve, a firm steepener of the yield curve usually implies economic hardship if not an outright economic bust.
           

              
           

             Gold. Is. Counter. Cyclical...relative to speculative risk assets.
           

              
           

             Through years of moaning, in some corners, about gold's lack of performance, let's just note that gold has generally performed better than it should have performed with macro signaling such as it has been since mid-2020.
           

              
           

             But firmness in the gold price – again, backing out the war inputs, which are there and do complicate if not compromise the fundamental picture – is likely looking ahead to turns in the macro yet to come. For months now various indicators have been slipping that way (the yield curve above is exhibit A) but it is when the herds (and their fund managers) take note that these turns will become obvious on Main Street.
           

              
           

             In a complicated macro, yield curves are currently steepening. That's a fact."

IN 1999 it was reported that the world population had reached 6 billion, 
            writes Tim Price at Price Value Partners.


              
           

             The rate of growth was 1.3% per year. That might not sound dramatic. But at that rate, the world population would double over the next half century.
           

              
           

             Recent changes in birthrates and even more recent demographic developments 'associated' with the global 'overreaction' to Covid suggest that population growth will not be the problem that it seemed at the turn of the millennium. And 1.3% is a relatively modest annual growth rate.
           

              
           

             But if it were to continue, the world population would reach a density of one person per square metre on the dry land surface of the earth in just 780 years. The mass of people on the earth would equal the mass of the earth itself in just 2400 years. In the words of the late Dr.Albert Bartlett, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, US:
           

              
           

              ""The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.""
           

              
           

             An exponential function is simply one in which a variable increases at a fixed rate or percentage per time period. This is opposed to an arithmetic function, in which growth is by a fixed amount each period. The sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6 illustrates arithmetic growth. The sequence 1,2,4,8,16,32 demonstrates exponential growth.
           

              
           

             As Dr.Bartlett points out, at some point in the comparatively near future, zero population growth will happen. (The WHO in association with Bill Gates may yet have played their part.) But it would be mathematically certain in any case, as a simple response to steady, exponential growth. Whatever human beings might want to do, the finite carrying capacity of the earth, and Mother Nature, will have the final say.
           

              
           

             Let's take another of Dr.Bartlett's observations. Imagine bacteria growing steadily in a bottle. They double in number every minute (the so-called ""doubling time"" in other words is one minute). At 11 am., there is one bacterium in the bottle; at 12 noon the bottle is full.
           

              
           

             Question 1: at what time was the bottle half full?
           

             Question 2: if you were an average bacterium in the bottle, at what time would you first realize that you were running out of space?
           

             Question 3: suppose that at 11.58 am, some of the bacteria realize that they are running out of room. So they launch a great search for new bottles. They search offshore, on the outer continental shelf, and in the arctic, and they find three new bottles – a ""colossal new discovery"". How long can the growth continue as a result of the discovery of three new bottles; this quadrupling of the proven resource?
           

              
           

             Answer 1: the bottle was half full at 11.59 am.
           

              
           

             Answer 2: the question, of course, is rhetorical. But as Dr.Bartlett says,
           

              
           

             ""Think about this. This kind of steady growth is the centrepiece of the national economy and of the entire global economy.""
           

              
           

             At 11.55 am., the bottle is just 1/32 full. With just five minutes left until it fills completely with bacteria, the bottle is 31/32 empty!
           

              
           

             Answer 3: all of the bottles are completely full by 12.02. Those extra three bottles bought our bacteria just two extra minutes. That is the power and challenge of the exponential function.
           

              
           

             We should point out that the exponential function has an ominous relevance to growth – and the limits of growth – in government debt. That shrill, discordant sound you hear is the debt piper; and he really wants to be paid.
           

              
           

             But let's talk about energy. Particularly the political, social and market implications of ""peak oil"" in what are certain to be volatile years ahead.
           

              
           

             Why the references to Dr.Bartlett?
           

              
           

             Because as US Secretary of Energy James Schlesinger told Time Magazine in April 1977 (perhaps the last time that Americans were truly worried about running out of oil) during the Opec price hike-triggered energy crisis of the 1970s:
           

              
           

             ""We have a classic case of exponential growth against a finite source"".
           

              
           

             You may be familiar with Hubbert's Peak. The late Dr.M.King Hubbert was one of the most celebrated geophysicists who made his reputation on the back of a startling prediction, first made public in 1949, that the era of so-called fossil fuels would be surprisingly short-lived. In 1956 he predicted that US oil production would peak in around 1970 and decline thereafter.
           

              
           

             US oil production did indeed peak in 1970. But as James Howard Kunstler points out in his book, 'The Long Emergency', it took a year for the peak to be detected, when lower production figures started to be reported.
           

              
           

             Peak US oil production in 1970 amounted to 11.3 million barrels per day (bpd). That was the high watermark for the US oil industry. Production would fall by several per cent per year thereafter. By the mid-1980s, total US crude oil production had fallen below 9 million bpd. It is now running at approximately 6 million bpd. (Recent advances in the shale arena have somewhat rebalanced the equation – but then so have the Biden administration's asinine energy 'policies'.)
           

              
           

             This is not just a US problem. Hubbert went on to forecast that global oil production would peak between 1990 and 2000. Colin Campbell, retired chief of research for Shell Oil, estimated that global peak oil would occur in 2007, and Kenneth Deffeyes of Princeton forecast the global peak at 2005. It may well be that the global oil peak is already behind us.
           

              
           

             Not all of the oil below ground will ever be pumped out. Long before an oil field runs completely dry, the oil contained within it becomes so difficult or expensive to pump that it takes more than a barrel of oil's worth of energy to pump out one barrel. Even at peak, there will be plenty of oil left in the ground. But in Kunstler's words it will be ""the half that is deeper down, harder and costlier to extract, sitting under harsh and remote parts of the world, owned in some cases by people with a grudge against [the West], and this remaining oil will be contested by everyone.
           

              
           

             ""At peak and just beyond, there is massive potential for system failures of all kinds, social, economic and political. Peak is quite literally a tipping point. Beyond peak, things unravel and the centre does not hold. Beyond peak, all bets are off about civilisation's future.""
           

              
           

             Sound eerily relevant to our current cultural and economic predicaments today? (Doubly a shame and a scandal beyond words, then, that the US – the world's self-appointed policeman and putative sole superpower – appears frozen into trance-like paralysis under the baleful influence of the Biden crime administration, just as its 'end of empire' tribute act gets into full swing.)
           

              
           

             If 'peak oil' is a real phenomenon, and it is still debated, it is a huge deal. We are not facing the end of fossil fuels, but we are undoubtedly facing the end of cheap fossil fuels.
           

              
           

             Try and identify a single facet of modern life that doesn't have its origins or continued existence courtesy of cheap oil and natural gas. Central heating; air conditioning; cars and the fuel that drives them; powered flight; electric lighting; the very fabric of agriculture, and not least fertilizers. And the clothes worn by 'Just Stop Oil' protesters.
           

              
           

             In what James Howard Kunstler calls 'The long emergency', mankind may face a compelling pressure to revert to a more localised existence. Anything more ""global"" might be simply impossible once the next oil shock hits (if we're not already experiencing it). We may have to get used to an altogether more ""local"" economy, one in which year-round strawberries are a thing of the past. Same goes for commuting for miles in a gas-guzzling SUV. Grotesque and illiberal though they are, things like ULEZ taxes and 15-minute cities seem indicative of the Big State's determination to make political capital – and of course to seize private capital – out of a perceived concern over scarcity and the environment.
           

              
           

             For some years now, we have been writing about the doleful effects of the global financial crisis, and endeavouring to navigate through it. In all that time, energy has been a side issue by comparison with the malign impact of broken banks and bankrupt sovereign finances.
           

              
           

             But the long financial crisis will ultimately end, as confidence and economic vigour slowly returns, and those banking institutions that survive come to rebuild their shattered balance sheets. There will be pain to be dished out as holders of government bonds belatedly come to realise that those assets are not as riskless as they thought. That pain indeed began roughly two years ago as the fundamental insolvency of the West became manifest through surging bond yields after policy and market interest rates reached their lowest – and even at the time clearly unsustainable – levels for 5,000 years.
           

              
           

             But an energy crisis borne out of a fundamental contraction in new oil supplies, and perhaps savage rises in the price of oil? It is difficult to foresee any element of modern society that wouldn't be dramatically affected.
           

              
           

             Whether from a social or an investment perspective, the natural response to fears about peak oil is to highlight alternative energies, whether in the form of wind, tide, solar, nuclear or hydrogen. There are obviously certain environmental benefits to these alternative fuel technologies, but typical discussion of their implementation ignores one critical fact. Apart from being markedly less efficient, no single alternative energy source can remotely begin to replace oil over either the short or medium term – because the installed base of hydrocarbon infrastructure is simply too vast.
           

              
           

             Even if scientists were to suddenly create a magical new energy source that was effectively free to use, it would take decades and trillions of Dollars to replace the existing hydrocarbon infrastructure – the network of tens of thousands of petrol stations that support the auto economy, for example. For more and excellent analysis of this topic, we recommend the excellent service provided by the Doomberg team on Substack.
           

              
           

             And if peak oil is for real, and if we are close to, or beyond, that peak, one thing seems clear: two-digit oil prices may well soon be a thing of the past, too.
           

              
           

             The immediate investment conclusion would seem to be to pile into the oil majors. But while the oil majors may well outperform the broader stock market – in recent history they've been absolute cash cows – we're not convinced that they'll be the best way to profit from peak oil. Why? Because they will also be in the unenviable position of having to pay more and more to get every increasingly valuable barrel of oil out of the ground. In other words, while their oil inventory will be worth more in current Dollars, their future extraction costs are going inevitably to soar as well, and the balance may not be in favour of stockholders. Precious metals and commodities miners have recently suffered from the shareholder perception (which we happen to think not entirely warranted) that higher extraction costs will outweigh higher future commodities prices.
           

              
           

             Oil prices may yet be set for a secular rerating on the back of 'peak oil'. Current heightened geopolitical tensions and fresh outright military conflict in the Middle East (and Asia?) will clearly put a bid under prices. And higher prices will to an extent compensate the oil majors for the heightened costs and risks of exploration and production. But oil majors will be obliged to go to ever more remote locations to explore and drill and therefore face more complex geological and geopolitical risks.
           

              
           

             Are people living in denial about the severity of the oil challenge facing the global economy? As a side note, while researching Dr.Bartlett's book, 'The Essential Exponential', we happened to stumble upon a review for Colin Campbell's 2004 book, 'The truth about oil and the looming energy crisis'...
           

              
           

             ""While on holiday in Italy some years back, we visited the remains of the Roman villa at Desenzano, Lake Garda, one of the most significant Roman villas in the north of the country. We were struck at how the museum's guidebook described its establishment:
           

              
           

             ""At the end of the Roman era, the general economic crisis destroyed the small and medium sized country estates and favoured the formation of a limited number of large villae, an expression of a strong concentration of agrarian property. Their proprietors left the city to move onto their land, where...they regained all the authority which they had lost in the deterioration of the political system.""
           

              
           

             Not much has changed with the passing of almost two thousand years. Now, as then, the wealthy are retreating to farmland – both geographically and within their investment portfolios – in a general focus on real assets amidst monetary and political uncertainty.
           

              
           

             Whether or not we believe in the peak oil thesis, the harsh reality would seem to be that global population growth and trends in energy consumption are imposing an increasingly untenable burden on our installed but secularly underdeveloped and underinvested energy infrastructure.
           

              
           

             So we must all now pay the price for that colossal political policy failure – both literally, and figuratively."

WE LEARN that gross domestic product expanded at an annualized 4.9% rate last quarter, 
            writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.


              
           

             ""The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending,"" says CNBC.
           

              
           

             Various reports describe the data as ""strong""...""stellar""...""sizzling.""
           

              
           

             Just so. Yet here at The Daily Reckoning, we tend to observe glasses that are half empty of liquid – not half full of liquid.
           

              
           

             Silver linings are gray edges and bright sides are usually the wrong sides.
           

              
           

             And like a man lowering water balloons onto a parade...or heaving a stink bomb into a wedding party...today we cast a pall upon the news.
           

              
           

             We simply do not believe what we are told. We believe we are being taken on a sleigh ride.
           

              
           

             In the official telling GDP equals: consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports.
           

              
           

             Let us consider the equation's initial component: consumption.
           

              
           

             We learn that third-quarter consumer spending leapt 4% – plenty handsome.
           

              
           

             Thus we are told the American consumer is flush. She represents some 68% of third-quarter economic expansion.
           

              
           

             ""This report confirmed what we already knew,"" says a certain Michael Arone of State Street Global Advisors, continuing:
           

              
           

             ""The consumer went on a shopping spree in the third quarter.""
           

              
           

             Yet this she did heavily on credit – she had a credit card in her purse.
           

              
           

             American credit card debt attained a record $1 trillion in this year's third quarter. Again...a record $1 trillion.
           

              
           

             Meantime, Americans' personal savings rate registered 3.9% this past quarter.
           

              
           

             The long-term average nears 9%.
           

              
           

             We must conclude the American consumer is purchasing on credit because her piggy bank is depleted of coins.
           

              
           

             Is this the sign of flush times? Or of lean times?
           

              
           

             What is more, she is in for a splendid migraine when her shopping bills come due.
           

              
           

             The annual interest charge for retail credit cards has attained a record 29% this year.
           

              
           

             Can she keep pace? We are not half so convinced she can keep pace.
           

              
           

             We expect to find her in a very poor way this time next year. That is, if we can find her at all.
           

              
           

             Her head may first slip beneath the water presently rising around her.
           

              
           

             Let us proceed to a central assault upon the consumption theory itself – the nearly universal theory that consumer consumption constitutes 70% of the United States economy.
           

              
           

             It likely constitutes far less.
           

              
           

             Official calculations of the gross domestic product neglect tremendous piles of economic doings.
           

              
           

             These doings include business investment and spending on ""intermediate"" goods.
           

              
           

             These are inputs required for the production of final goods – hence they are intermediate goods.
           

              
           

             The steel in the automobile, the sugar in the candy, the wood of the furniture...these are intermediate goods...for example.
           

              
           

             Yet their purchase does not classify as consumer spending – else they would be double-counted in the ledgers.
           

              
           

             Explains economist Mark Skousen:
           

              
           

             ""GDP only measures the value of final output. It deliberately leaves out a big chunk of the economy – intermediate production or goods-in-process at the commodity, manufacturing and wholesale stages – to avoid double counting.""
           

              
           

             Now mix in expenditures on intermediate goods. What do we find?
           

              
           

             We find that consumer consumption merely constitutes perhaps 30% of GDP. Skousen:
           

              
           

             ""I calculated total spending (sales or receipts) in the economy at all stages to be more than double GDP...By this measure – which I have dubbed gross domestic expenditures, or GDE – consumption represents only about 30% of the economy, while business investment (including intermediate output) represents over 50%.""
           

              
           

             To emphasize: Business investment represents over 50% of the gross domestic product.
           

              
           

             What do we learn today?
           

              
           

             We learn that business investment slackened 0.1% in the year's third quarter.
           

              
           

             We are not the least surprised that business investment slackened 0.1% in the year's third quarter.
           

              
           

             That is because borrowing costs are on the jump. And credit has become somewhat dear.
           

              
           

             The 10-year Treasury yield crossed 5% this week – if only briefly.
           

              
           

             And as we explained yesterday: Business projects that may yield juice at lower rates of interest may not yield juice at higher rates of interest.
           

              
           

             And so they are not undertaken. And that is why – we hazard – business investment has slackened.
           

              
           

             But to proceed...
           

              
           

             Let us recall the GDP equation: consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports.
           

              
           

             We now train our sights on the government spending ""contribution"" to the gross domestic product.
           

              
           

             We are told total government spending contributed 0.8 percentage points to third-quarter GDP.
           

              
           

             Affirms MarketWatch:
           

              
           

             ""Government spending, meanwhile, rose sharply again, largely because of an increase in defense-related purchases. The US has sent lots of arms to Ukraine and has to replenish its own dwindling military supplies.""
           

              
           

             We can merely surmise that any economic reversal should be met by vast increases to the expenditure on tanks, warplanes and warships.
           

              
           

             The economy would be up and away in very short order. But we let it pass.
           

              
           

             A question nonetheless arises: How can government spending add even the lonest cent to the gross domestic product?
           

              
           

             We must first recall that government lacks all resources. Imagine a parasite with its fangs sunk into a host.
           

              
           

             You have just imagined a government.
           

              
           

             This parasite may serve certain useful functions, we may concede if we are in generous humor.
           

              
           

             The host/parasite relationship nonetheless obtains.
           

              
           

             Before government can ladle out one meager Dollar for guns, for butter, for bread, for circuses...it must first pluck it from private pockets – directly or indirectly.
           

              
           

             That is, through taxes or credit. That is, through taxes or taxes.
           

              
           

             As we have explained before: The Dollar borrowed appears a lesser plucking than the Dollar taxed.
           

              
           

             But it is an equal plucking. It is merely a plucking at one remove.
           

              
           

             Do not forget, the borrowed Dollar must be repaid – with interest into the bargain. And who pays it?
           

              
           

             The answer, at all times and in all places, is the taxpayer.
           

              
           

             Government at all levels is credited with a thumping 36% of United States GDP spending.
           

              
           

             Yet we are fond to cite this example:
           

              
           

             Assume the government pays a fellow to shovel a hole. Assume further this government pays him to empty the dirt back in.
           

              
           

             In the official telling you have just witnessed an increase to the gross domestic product.
           

              
           

             Yet have you?
           

              
           

             Or have you merely witnessed a sort of leg-pulling, a statistical feint – a squandering of time, effort and resources?
           

              
           

             We believe you have your answer.
           

              
           

             Furthermore: Automobile production, computer production, food production, widget production, all enhance the consumer's material existence.
           

              
           

             Does tank production? Does warplane production? Does warship production?
           

              
           

             We are riddled with doubt.
           

              
           

             They may be necessary. They are very likely necessary.
           

              
           

             Yet let us see them in their true aspect – as expenditures – not consumer ""goods"".
           

              
           

             They do not enhance the consumer's economic health.
           

              
           

             Thus we conclude our reflections on today's ""sizzling"" economic report.
           

              
           

             Into our hellbox it goes. And hopefully into yours."
2023-10-26,"Title:Gold at LBMA 2023: High, Quality, Liquid
Article:Taking stock in Barcelona. Lots of gold bar and coin stock...!


              
           


ANOTHER AUTUMN, another LBMA conference for the precious metals industry, 
            writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.


              
           

             More attendees than ever joined the London Bullion Market Association's latest shindig, held last week in Barcelona, Spain.
           

              
           

             But while everyone got busy meeting with partners, suppliers, buyers, competitors and friends, they got much less news than we've grown accustomed to. 
           

              
           

             No market-changing rules (responsible sourcing for refiners, 
            LBMA 2011 in Montreal) or shock exits (Mitsui, 
            Vienna 2015) or sudden buyers (Reserve Bank of India, 
            Edinburgh 2009) or existential crises (banking's NSFR regulations, 
            Singapore 2016).
           

              
           

             Instead, this year's event offered a moment to take stock. And as the excellent session on 'Consumer demand in a time of high prices' showed – as well as the cheerful ""tumbleweed"" comments from many attendees over drinks – there's a lot of stock to take for gold bar-and-coin retailers right now.
           

              
           

             If there was a scoop (heavens knows we tried to find you one, beyond the whispers and mutterings about central-bank demand in 2023 beating even last year's post-war 
            record gold reserves demand) it came on Day 2, in the final formal session of the LBMA 2023 conference in Barcelona.
           

              
           

             Because someone, finally, explained what-in-the-hell is HQLA.
           

              
           

             ""It means 'high-quality liquid asset',"" said David Gornall, former head of trading at French investment bank Natixis, chairman of LBMA during the tumult of the early 2010s, and now senior advisor to the Association's executive team.
           

              
           

             ""Go on..."" asked 
            no one but me.
           

              
           

             I mean, 
            HQLA is banking regulation. Who cares? Who can stay awake when it's explained, even this well?
           

              
           

             Turns out, maybe, we all should. Especially the wider banking and finance industry, never mind anyone in physical gold.
           

              
           

             You'll find David's explanation, plus the ramifications for the HQLA future of the gold market here on 
            GoldNews in the next couple of days.
           

              
           

             Meantime, and as the latest LBMA conference confirmed, those words – high, quality, liquid – already apply to our market anyway right now. And not necessarily in a good way.
           

              
           
 Gold High. Very

             Gold prices have rarely been higher than today in US Dollar terms, and they've never traded this high in Chinese Yuan, Turkish Lira, Euros, Japanese Yen, Sterling, Aussie Dollars or most other currencies.
           

              
           

             But rather than giving a bullish tone to LBMA 2023, and despite the very upbeat mood of delegates in person, this left the Barcelona conference's forecast for gold prices looking pretty deflated...
           

              
           

             ...with the average delegate prediction for October 2024 (when we next meet, in Miami, Florida) coming in at just $1990 per Troy ounce.
           

              
           

             Yes, that's a big number. Gold was trading nearly $375 lower than that only this time last year. But even with gold prices now trading at their highest ever for the LBMA's October conference (even in Dollar terms) it doesn't mark the highest-ever such forecast.
           

              
           

             For that, see Montreal 2011 predicting $2019 off $1800, or lockdown's 2020 conference online predicting $2177 off $1900 at the time of asking.
           

              
           




              
           

             Moreover, last week's forecast predicted only a 4% rise from where gold was trading as the conference began. And that broke the mold if not the cupola...
           

              
           

             ...because while LBMA delegates 
            peering at their crystal balls tend to forecast a bullish move after seeing one over the prior 12 months...
           

              
           

             ...the conference's 4% twelve-month outlook contrasts with the last 12 months' 15% gain in gold prices.
           

              
           

             That was the 5th biggest bullish move from October-to-October of the last 15 LBMA conferences. Yet in percentage terms, LBMA conference attendees just gave their least bullish prediction since the depths of gold's post-financial crisis bear market in 2015. And that was the only time since the early 2000s that delegates – on average – said prices would drop.
           

              
           

             What gives?
           

              
           

             ""Delegates historically trend overly bullish,"" notes Nicky Shiels, precious metals strategist at Swiss refining and finance group MKS Pamp (and moderator of Day 1's excellent PGM session), in her round-up of last week's LBMA conference.
           

              
           

             ""[So] the mildly bullish forecast from delegates is indicative of a lack of conviction"" in the face of higher-for-longer interest rates, even ""while physical [consumer] regions AND central banks continue to be super supportive.""
           

              
           

             Contrarian klaxon? Reviewing the history of LBMA conference forecasts, maybe the past 12 months' gains in gold just weren't big enough. Because, if you map prior conference predictions against what just happened to prices...
           

              
           

             ...rather than trying to see if those forecasts hold any predictive value...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...then the chart makes much more sense.
           

              
           

             Especially if you allow for the fact that, for many LBMA conference attendees, the price they charge – whether for coins, small bars or jewelry – comes a little or more above spot prices anyway.
           

              
           
 Gold Quality

             At root, the LBMA exists to set and maintain the Good Delivery standards for the fineness, shape and size of bullion bars acceptable to the London market, heart of precious metals trading and storage worldwide.
           

              
           

             That way, LBMA members – and their customers – trade only the very best metal, good every time it's delivered and without needing an assayer to check and re-check quality each time the gold is moved from one specialist vault to another. 
           

              
           

             But on top of the physical requirements, further rules keep accruing to the Good Delivery standards, adding – most dramatically – 
            ever more ESG requirements over the last decade and more.
           

              
           

             That acronym – environmental, social and governance – covers pretty much everything you might hope to achieve (or be accused of failing to do) over and above turning a profit. But ESG increasingly matters to that profit as well. Because as 4-decade market veteran Mehdi Barkhordar said in the 'Future of Gold' panel on Day 2 of LBMA 2023, ""ESG equals R, and R stands for reputation.""
           

              
           

             Hence the hot topic (again) of trying to 
            get more gold from artisanal and small-scale mining into London Good Delivery gold bars. Start by adding ASM and LGD to your alphabet soup. Because the volume of gold unearthed by some of the world's very poorest people which finds its way into LGD bullion has collapsed, sinking to barely 1% of the formal market's new annual supply.
           

              
           

             Why? ESG of course! Plus all the resulting reputational threats which stepping outside the large-scale stock-market-listed mining sector risks bringing down on your head thanks to ever-tighter rules on conflict-free supply chains, ever-tighter anti-money laundering rules across the financial and commercial sectors, and all the due diligence checks now added since the first Responsible & Sustainable Sourcing rules came into force in 2012. (Yes, add RSS to your acronyms too.)
           

              
           

             Now, that figure for LGD gold coming from ASM has risen to perhaps 2% over the last 12 months. So 
            the LBMA's initiative – working together with the mining industry's World Gold Council – appears to be helping. But that 2% figure still contrasts badly with 
            estimates of 15-20% for the total volume of all the world's newly-mined gold which comes from ASM's informal, sometimes illegal and often dangerous production...
           

              
           

             ...and it leaves perhaps 20 if not 40 million people worldwide digging gold out of the ground but locked out of earning the higher prices which the LGD supply chain pays versus the cut-price bid from gangsters and crooks.
           

              
           

             What to do? Lots of people have lots of ideas. And demands.
           

              
           

             ""The LBMA's ASM project applies risk-based due diligence, rather than assuming guilt,"" noted Gregory Mthembu-Salter, director of South Africa-based Phuzumoya Consulting, chairing the Responsible Sourcing session last week and raising hopes that 'perfect' won't keep being the enemy of the 'good'.
           

              
           

             But some NGOs (there's another acronym; non-governmental organizations) are pushing back on that approach, while others demand that refiners on the London Good Delivery list not only take metal from ASM miners but also spend additional money to improve their lives and local society, too.
           

              
           

             Together, that risks cementing the ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" problem that's forced some major refiners to quit buying metal from entire continents rather than spend time and money just to put their reputation on the line. 
           

              
           

             Governments also keep making demands of the legal gold industry too...
           

              
           




              
           

             ...rightly pushing against conflict, terrorist and organized crime-funding gold but also raising the risks – over and above reputation – into the courts (if not jail) for anyone daring to try expanding the formal industry's feedstock by engaging with and paying ASM miners.
           

              
           

             Why would the refiners and banks bother? Business is humming along anyway, right?
           

              
           
 Gold Liquid

             Forget the cerveza in Barcelona (if you can recall it to start with). Liquidity in any market, as the LBMA Barcelona conference was reminded in both this year's very strong 'Investment exposure' session and by the 'Future of gold' panel, means the ability to sell as easily as you buy without suffering a deep price discount as you get your order matched.
           

              
           

             And for gold – suddenly – retail dealers across the West are finding that their customers 
            want to sell the stuff back to them at today's all-time or near-record highs.
           

              
           

             ""This is 
            the most dramatic change in consumer gold demand I can remember in any major market,"" said 37-year precious metals veteran Wolfgang Wrzesniok-Rossbach, founder and CEO of consultancy Fragold GmbH, of the German bullion coin and bar market.
           

              
           

             How dramatic? Germany's retail gold bar and coin demand is down 78% this year versus 2022. Net silver demand has sunk by 90%.
           

              
           

             Sure, this plunges comes off a very high base. Perhaps it's just a return to normal as German and other European citizens finally get to earn a positive rate of interest on their cash savings again (well, positive until you account for inflation) rather than paying a negative rate as they faced from 2014 to 2022.
           

              
           

             But the plunge is proving a real shock to some newer German gold and silver retailers, and the sudden lack of new buyers across Western economies – plus the move to take profit among existing private investors, as well as among ETF shareholders and (for instance) BullionVault users – means metal is piling up.
           

              
           

             So again, last week's opportunity to take stock of the precious metals market in late 2023 gave many attendees a quick break from counting stock back in their office, shop or warehouse. But for others, as well as for those unsurprised by and prepared for client flows in the other direction, business remains brisk, and the commercial outlook upbeat.
           

              
           

             After all, the bear market of 2012-2015 came to an end. So did the long bear market of 1980 to 2001. This too shall pass. But it is an oddity. Record high prices, net investor outflows.
           

              
           

             Someone's buying, in short, and they're paying record high prices. Not the usual suspects at the top of a bull run. This time it's emerging-market consumers buying and, most dramatically, 
            central bank gold holdings."
2023-10-23,"Title:The High Price of Optimism
Article:Investing means staying the course, sure. But be realistic...

 VICE ADMIRAL James Stockdale has a good claim to have been one of the most extraordinary, not to say one of the bravest, Americans ever to have lived, writes Tim Price at Price Value Partners.
 On September 9th, 1965 he was shot down over North Vietnam and seized by a mob. Having broken a bone in his back ejecting from his plane he had his leg broken and his arm badly injured. He would spend the next seven years in Hoa Lo Prison, the infamous ""Hanoi Hilton"".
 The physical brutality was unspeakable, and the mental torture never stopped. He would be kept in solitary confinement, in total darkness, for four years. He would be kept in heavy leg-irons for two years, on a starvation diet, deprived even of letters from home.
 Throughout it all, Stockdale was stoic.
 When told he would be paraded in front of foreign journalists, he slashed his own scalp with a razor and beat himself in the face with a wooden stool so that he would be unrecognisable and useless to the enemy's press.
 When he discovered that his fellow prisoners were being tortured to death, he slashed his wrists to show his torturers that he would not submit to them.
 When his guards finally realised that he would die before cooperating, they relented. The torture of American prisoners ended, and the treatment of all American prisoners of war improved.
 After being released in 1973, Stockdale was awarded the Medal of Honour. He was one of the most decorated officers in US naval history, with 26 personal combat decorations, including four Silver Stars.
 Jim Collins, author of the influential study of US businesses, 'Good to Great', interviewed Stockdale during his research for the book. How had he found the courage to survive those long, dark years?
 ""I never lost faith in the end of the story,"" replied Stockdale.
 ""I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining moment of my life, which in retrospect, I would not trade.""
 Collins was silent for a few minutes. The two men walked along, Stockdale with a heavy limp, swinging a stiff leg that had never properly recovered from repeated torture. Finally, Collins went on to ask another question. Who didn't make it out?
 ""Oh, that's easy,"" replied Stockdale. ""The optimists.""
 Collins was confused.
 ""The optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be out by Christmas.' And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. Then they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.' And Easter would come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving. And then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart.""
 As the two men walked slowly onward, Stockdale turned to Collins.
 ""This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end – which you can never afford to lose – with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.""
 As Collins' book came to be published, this observation came to be known as the Stockdale Paradox. For Collins, it was exactly the same sort of behaviour displayed by those company founders who had led their businesses through thick and thin. The alternative was the average managers at also-ran companies that generated average returns at best, or which failed completely.
 And we have had interest rates held at emergency levels for over a decade – igniting inflationary problems that are now all too visible, not least in the bond market. Central bankers are now trapped in a monetary policy killing pen of their own design; they cannot afford to raise rates to the levels realistically required, and pivoting back to cutting rates will destroy the last vestiges of policy credibility and currency stability.
 What are the implications for global asset allocation and stock selection?
 Both in absolute terms and relative to equities, most bond markets are collapsing in real time. Ever since the risk-free rate became the return-free risk, and given the dismal outlook for higher inflation, especially after new Middle Eastern conflict, stocks now look like the only game in town (aside from commodities, of course), and value stocks the most favourable tactic for playing that game.
 As regards stock markets, price is what you pay, and value (or lack thereof) is what you get. On any fair analysis, the US market in particular is a fly in search of a windscreen. Using Professor Robert Shiller's cyclically adjusted price / earnings ratio for the broad US stock market (currently 29.8x), shown below, US stocks have only been more expensive than they are today a handful of times in the past 130 years: in 2000, when they briefly traded at 44x, and more recently, just before the scamdemic. We are now ""merely"" back to 1929 pre-Crash levels, at around 30x.
 The peak-to-trough fall for the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1929, for example (when the market hit a Shiller p/e of only 30x), equated to 89%. The peak-to-trough fall for the Dow from 2000 equated to ""just"" 38%. Time will tell just how disappointing (both by scale and by duration) the coming years will be for US equity market and growth stock bulls.
 Vice Admiral Stockdale was unequivocal: while we need to confront the ""brutal facts"" of the marketplace, we also need to keep faith that we will prevail. To us, that boils down to avoiding conspicuous overvaluation (in most bond markets, for example, and a significant portion of the developed equity markets) and embracing equally conspicuous value – where current poor sentiment is likely to intensify subsequent upside returns. In this uniquely oppressive financial environment, with the skies darkening with the risks of sovereign debt default, or reset, we think innocent optimism could be fatal. Or as Warren Buffett once observed,
 ""You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.""
 We also seek portfolio diversification in uncorrelated assets (in our case, systematic trend-following funds) and, increasingly, in real assets (sensibly priced, hugely cash-generative listed businesses which derive the bulk of their earnings from the processing and provision of commodities, notably gold and silver).
 Elroy Dimson, Mike Staunton, and Paul Marsh titled their classic study of equity market returns for the 20th Century 'Triumph of the Optimists'. It seems to us that in the months and years to come, realists may yet have the last laugh."
2023-10-20,"Title:Big Bitcoin Fake-Out
Article:How reading the news can hurt your trading...

 SOME market pundits are convinced stocks are gearing up for a big year-end rally in stocks, writes Greg Guenther in Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.
 Other prognosticators see nothing but doom and gloom on the horizon – along with a major market correction. I believe there's credible evidence supporting both scenarios.
 But the market doesn't care what you or I (or anyone else) thinks. We could gather the world's most prominent bullish and bearish investors for a weeklong retreat to debate the merits of their arguments. Yet this exercise would have no bearing on how stocks finished the year.
 The world is much too complex for market action to work out this way. We're always just a war, pandemic, or terrorist attack away from having to rethink just above everything we thought was true at the time.
 Right now, the averages are stuck in a sideways struggle. It's a frustrating situation for many traders and investors since the market isn't trending higher or lower.
 But I believe we can put these choppy periods to good use.
 Instead of forcing too many ill-advised trades, we've discussed some of my bigger-picture market philosophies over the past several weeks. And as the chop continues, it feels as if the action is subtly confirming the most important messages from our discussions.
 We have no edge in the markets. We cannot discover any magical formula that will give us an advantage over other investors.
 Fundamental information has no short-term predictive power. And, most importantly, price is the most effective indicator we can use to time our buys and sells.
 While these concepts are relatively simple, they are far from easy to put into practice.
 Fortunately, the markets are gracious enough to give us another chance to get it right. Our best opportunities are always right around the corner, no matter how we've performed in the past. If we pay close attention and are willing to learn from our mistakes, the market will offer teaching moments we can use to get better every single day.
 One of these amazing teaching moments just so happens to be playing out this week. The story isn't over yet, but the initial reactions as it began to unfold tell us a lot about how markets work in real time – and how emotional investors typically react to new information.
 It all started early Monday morning as futures were attempting to rally off their overnight lows. Bitcoin was also starting to tick higher after pushing toward $28K on Sunday evening. Traders were on the lookout for a bounce in the tech growth and crypto following Friday's ugly performance. But they had no idea what would happen next...
 Just before the opening bell, Bitcoin suddenly exploded higher. It looked like it was starting to squeeze as the price jumped from $28K to almost $30K in just a couple minutes.
 But after a little digging, it appeared that this potential breakout move was triggered by a social media post. A crypto Twitter account with almost 2 million followers reported that the SEC approved BlackRock's iShares spot Bitcoin ETF.
 Bitcoin was rocketing on the SEC approval news. There was just one problem: no other sources seemed to be able to confirm the information. After briefly hitting $30K for the first time since August, the rally began to unwind almost as fast as it appeared.
 By 9:45, Bitcoin was well below $28K again. Forty-five minutes later, the same Twitter account that initially spread the news was posting an apology:
 Cointelegraph later revealed that they took a tip that turned out to be a fake Bloomberg headline. It’s still unclear whether this was a prank or someone attempting to manipulate the market.
 But as far as I’m concerned, the reasons don’t matter at all…
 To be clear, I don’t fault the folks at Cointelegraph for the SEC mixup.
 Whether the news is “real” or “fake” doesn’t really matter. What does matter is how the market reacts to the information.
 In this case, an extreme influx of buyers swooped in when the headline first hit social media, bullying the price of Bitcoin sharply higher.
 But what happened to these early news reactors?
 I suppose some of the more savvy buyers might have set alerts that allowed them to get in minutes — or maybe even 20-30 seconds — after the news broke. But there’s no realistic chance that any random trader was able to get in at the exact moment the market started moving.
 Accounting for slippage, I doubt it would even be possible to make a profit on a move like this. In a more likely scenario, you’d buy in the $29K range, then get stopped out minutes later as the move failed. Or, even worse, you would buy and then watch your position immediately sink into the red as Bitcoin reversed.
 As we discussed earlier, this story isn’t over yet. Bitcoin did manage to slowly move higher into Monday evening following the initial attempt at $30K. But I have to assume there are more than a few traders with underwater positions who attempted to play the headline.
 The takeaway is simple: You can’t trade the news or time your short-term buys and sells by the headlines. Whether you’re tracking a planned earnings announcement or a surprise event, it’s impossible to know if the buying or selling force from the initial reaction will continue.
 This is also one of the main reasons I never attempt to play earnings. You never know how a stock will react – even to solid numbers. The CFO could hiccup during the conference call and send the stock down 5%. Or, you might have to sit through a couple of false moves while the market attempts to sort out its final reaction to the new information.
 The purest breakouts in the market that are most reliable happen because of supply and demand dynamics. Aggressive sellers overwhelm demand, or aggressive buyers chew through supply at critical levels.
 Once resistance is defeated, the stage is set for an extended move that can play out for days, weeks, or even longer.
 That’s where the real money is made."
2023-10-19,"Title:Zombie Credit to Die At Last?
Article:The Fed upturned sound central banking to feed zombie borrowers...

 TODAY we run a warning flag up our flagpole, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 For we have detected zombies.
 Zombies? Robert Burrows of BondVigilantes.com:
 ""Zombie firms are essentially companies that exist on borrowed time.
 ""They struggle to generate enough profits to cover their debt obligations, yet manage to stay afloat thanks to lenient borrowing conditions. The prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis played a significant role in sustaining these firms, allowing them to refinance their debts at favorable terms.
 ""As a result, many of these entities have been able to continue operating, albeit with weakened balance sheets and limited growth prospects.""
 These zombies exist in a sort of twilit torpor between life and death.
 Their condition resembles a coma – yet it is not precisely a coma.
 It is more a guttering along...in a reduced, scarcely comatose existence.
 Yet they refuse to die the death. They can scare up sufficient credit to keep the Grim Reaper and the devil at arm's distance.
 Thus they are zombies...neither alive nor dead...both alive and dead.
 They acquired their bizarre existence during the era of zero interest rates and infinite credit.
 Cheap, nearly cost-free credit sustained them. They got while the getting was good.
 Yet the getting is no longer good.
 Interest rates have soared high above zero. And the cheap credit that sustained them is no longer cheap.
 Burrows:
 ""One of the key factors enabling zombie firms to survive has been the availability of cheap credit. As central banks increase interest rates in response to improving economic conditions and/or inflation, the environment that has sustained these firms has shifted dramatically. Higher interest rates will lead to increased borrowing costs for these entities, potentially pushing some of them over the brink and into insolvency.""
 Now these zombies are on the move, destination Main Street:
 ""The persistence of zombie firms has implications beyond individual company struggles. These entities tie up resources that could otherwise be invested in more productive and innovative ventures. Resources such as labor, capital and market share are effectively locked within these stagnant firms, inhibiting the overall efficiency of the economy. This phenomenon can contribute to sluggish economic growth, reduced job creation and a less dynamic business landscape.""
 Bloomberg has identified some 600 such creatures – or 20% of the United States' largest publicly traded entities.
 Their very existence represents a larceny of the present and a larceny of the future.
 They are devouring resources that might otherwise serve productive purpose.
 Imagine for the moment that you inhabit a sane and parallel universe.
 Imagine that the Federal Reserve let economic and financial systems run their natural course following the 2008 nastiness.
 Interest rates would have likely gone soaring.
 Many firms loaded to the gunwales with debt would have filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of United States Code.
 The grief – though acute – would have likely proven brief.
 Sound business with deep roots within the soil would have endured.
 Higher interest rates would have encouraged savings...and gradually re-amassed the capital stock.
 From this capital stock the green shoots of future growth would have come thrusting.
 Yet it was not to be.
 Rather than letting the cleansing fire clear away the deadwood...the Federal Reserve intervened to preserve it.
 This it did for years under zero or near-zero interest rate policy.
 Yet artificially low interest rates rob the future to gratify the present.
 They deprive the struggling saplings of their nourishment – nourishment that promises tomorrow's growth.
 How many future redwoods never came into being because these zombies robbed their nutrients?
 The answer is many.
 Thus the Federal Reserve shattered the six mandates of sound central banking.
 These are, as summarized by Wikipedia:

 protect the money stock instead of saving individual institutions;
 rescue solvent institutions only;
 let insolvent institutions default;
 charge penalty rates;
 require good collateral; and
 announce the conditions before a crisis so that the market knows exactly what to expect.

A word of explanation – perhaps – on ""penalty rates""...
 The central bank should charge interest rates above the market rate.
 Else the central bank would be a lender of resort – not the lender of last resort.
 A high rate further encourages debtors to retire their debts rapidly...to shake loose the heavy burden as soon as circumstances grant.
 Yet what does the Federal Reserve's actual record reveal?
 Economist Thomas M.Humphrey is the author of Lender of Last Resort: What It Is, Whence It Came and Why the Fed Isn't It.
 This fellow argues that the Federal Reserve turned the six mandates of sound central banking upon their heads.
 Its perverted mandates were – and are:

 ""Emphasis on credit (loans) as opposed to money...
 ""taking junk collateral...
 ""charging subsidy rates...
 ""rescuing insolvent firms too big and interconnected to fail...
 ""extension of loan repayment deadlines...
 ""no pre-announced commitment.""

Thus the Federal Reserve took sound central banking and knocked it 180 degrees out of phase.
 It has warred against all six mandates – and massively against mandates 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 It has proved incompetent at its profession.
 Imagine a plumber who does not patch leaks but creates leaks...a doctor who does not mend bones but cracks bones...a head shrinker who does not shrink heads but expands heads.
 Now you have the flavor of it.
 What nutrients are sustaining these zombies at present? The answer is largely high-yield bonds – junk bonds.
 They have held up to date. Yet in the likely event of recession? Look out.
 Deutsche Bank crackerjacks Jim Reid and Karthik Nagalingam hazard that defaults in junk bonds will near 12% – their historic highs.
 Furthermore, as Barron's notes:
 ""The Federal Reserve has committed to keep interest rates 'high for longer', which should cause the US economy to weaken – and weaken highly indebted companies, leading to more defaults by these speculative-grade borrowers over the next year.""
 Thus these zombies are in for a good hard shellacking...or so we hazard.
 They are resilient, it is true – else they would not be zombies.
 Yet they can be dispatched over the rainbow with the proper blow to the proper location.
 Rising rates may represent that blow.
 We are all for it. ""Death to the zombies!"" is our cry.
 They have worked enough wreckage as is."
2023-10-15,"Title:New Macro, New Gold Stock Bull
Article:Compare the HUI/Gold ratio to 30-year yields...

 GOLD STOCKS are rallying in the short-term, but the real move may still be ahead, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 This article views the gold stock sector's big picture bullish situation from the standpoint of a single indicator, the HUI/Gold ratio and its relationship to the 30-year Treasury bond yield.
 On the shorter-term and without going into tactical detail in a public post, the gold stock sector will either continue bouncing to end the correction that has been in force since the spring or it will take a final plunge. A final shakeout that could come amid vastly improved or improving fundamentals. As of the end of Q3 those fundamentals had not improved. They had degraded.
 Indeed, we reviewed both the technical and fundamental situations in a Trade Log & Notes for NFTRH subscribers last week, and have been tracking each routinely in weekend reports. We will be present and accounted for when the time is right to pound the table because NFTRH is committed to right-minded, as opposed to promotional or hopeful analysis.
 Back on the big picture, I find views like this compelling. While there is no particular rhyme or reason for the HUI/Gold ratio to have tracked the 30-year Treasury bond yield 'Continuum' on any given interim phase (and it has not done so), over the last 20 years the downtrend in long-term yields has coincided with a downtrend in the gold miners vs. the monetary metal they dig out of the earth. In other words, the yield has coincided with the HUI/Gold ratio.
 
 With many (but not all) upside pings of the blue line on the chart above, the 30-year Treasury yield indicated inflationary pressure running hot and thus, a bad time to be getting bullish on gold mining. Need any further proof that sources touting inflation as a reason to buy gold stocks are wrong?
 Gold mining stocks have routinely been impaired during the long inflation cycle. The Continuum is nothing if not a picture of a long disinflationary trend in bond market signaling that, especially since the 2001-2003 time frame,
 While the likes of Ben Bernanke really put the process on steroids, Alan Greenspan was regarded as a trailblazer in inflationary policy-making. He birthed the age of Inflation onDemand, with little regard for sound practices and much regard for the asset owner classes. Bernanke simply took the playbook and ran with it (to hero status).
 Together they launched and tended the 20 year phase of inflationary policy-making masked as heroism. Bernanke may have been ""the hero"", but Greenspan was the ""Maestro"", was he not?
 As to 'why' the chart's trend relationship between the HUI/Gold ratio and the yield may prove bullish for gold miners, since gold is proven to out-perform the miners during inflationary phases, what might happen when the macro flips the other way? If our view (that the current disinflationary Goldilocks trade will morph into a liquidity-constrained deflation scare before the next inflation phase) is correct, gold stocks should out-perform when the yield normalizes (pulls back)? Probably not the minute that yields obviously top and drop (inflationist bugs will be unloading, after all), but eventually the miners will grind out a bull market (or more accurately, continue the highly volatile one in place since 2016) that few will expect.
 I don't expect the old downtrend in the yield to reemerge, but a hard drop amid deflationary pressure would benefit the miners in relation to gold. It's not just a chart telling us that. It's the fact that gold has under-performed inflated commodities and markets since 2020 and often over the last 20 (inflationary) years, as the miners leveraged its under-performance (as pictured in the HUI/Gold ratio).
 Leverage works both ways. But most will not expect it to work in a positive way because herds were well tended by previous macro trends. Think of the big spike in the yield as a handle. The end."
2023-10-12,"Title:US Stocks Rose After Pearl Harbor
Article:But terror and destruction make stocks drop, no...?

 WE SUSPECTED the stock market would take a fright following last weekend's terrors in Israel, writes Brian Maher in The Daily Reckoning.
 It did not. The stock market yawned them off. Why?
 Today our thoughts turn to the sanguinary arts and sciences...and to Wall Street.
 That is, our thoughts turn to carnage, markets and how the two mingle.
 To what extent does warfare – or the prospect of warfare – manipulate markets?
 Much? Little?
 Our own James Altucher ransacked market history.
 From the Second World War clear through the tumults of Sept. 11, 2001, James stretched it all upon his canvas...rolled his sleeves, spat upon his hands...and got working.
 His purpose: to determine the impact of potentially systemic shocks on markets.
 James identified 10 such potential hells and their dates. The most conspicuous among them were:

 The commencement of World War II (Sept. 1, 1939)...
 Pearl Harbor (consult a book if you must)...
 The Cuban Missile Crisis (Oct. 22, 1962)...
 Sept. 11 itself.

James recorded the S&P's activity the day before the shock...the day after the shock...and its panicked low the week following the shock.
 He then inspected the S&P one week later, one month later and six months later. His conclusion?
 ""Each time, the market has absorbed the shock and moved past the event.""
 That is correct. The stock market took the blow and plowed on.
 When Herr Hitler blitzkrieged Poland on Sept. 1, 1939 – no average day – the US market largely shrugged its shoulders...as if it was an average day.
 The S&P took a slip. It found a shallow bottom merely days after.
 It proceeded higher for the next six months...as if the kraut soldaten were tourists on holiday...taking in the pleasant sights of Europe.
 Why weren't markets fleeing in headlong retreat – along with Europe?
 The Federal Reserve had yet to assume the role of stock market guardian and savior.
 Only in recent decades has it taken up that high and solemn duty.
 We cannot therefore credit the Federal Reserve for the stock market's steadfastness.
 Next we come to Pearl Harbor and its Dec. 7 Japanese visitation...
 It is true, the market took a good stagger after Pearl Harbor.
 And the S&P proceeded lower into January 1942. Yet it was up and punching shortly thereafter.
 It remained up and punching for the war's duration.
 The S&P opened each year higher than the previous year – until 1946.
 Of course comes the objection: Stocks were up and away on the prospects of ultimate Allied victory.
 Just so. Yet the S&P had found its legs in January 1942.
 What was occurring in January 1942?
 In January 1942 Japan was trouncing the American Navy and the Germans were amok in Europe.
 That is what was occurring in January 1942.
 The war tide only swung America's way after the Battle of Midway in June 1942 – several months after the market tide swung Wall Street's way.
 But to proceed, what about October 1962 and its famous missiles? Did the nuclear brinkmanship traumatize stocks as it traumatized people?
 It was – after all – a very near-run thing. Never had the world stood so precariously upon the devil's shovel.
 Yet it did not traumatize the stock market.
 After a brief fright the S&P went whistling on, merry as a grig, carefree as a bird.
 It saw the doomsday clock flashing 11:59 a.m. – not 11:59 p.m.
 ""What is most interesting is the ferocity with which the market rallied in only a few months,"" says James.
 The market spent the following three decades mocking Armageddon. James:
 The party started in 1962 and continued for the next seven years, resulting in the biggest bull market in history until the 1990s.
 Finally we come to Sept. 11, 2001. The very date makes an icicle of our spine.
 We were within direct eyesight of the World Trade Center that morning...and gazed in horror as its clone towers went heaping down.
 Markets were shuttered that entire week. They traded down heavily upon reopening.
 Yet one month later, the S&P was a mere 15 points from its Sept. 10 closing.
 Six months after the evil day the S&P was 73 points above its Sept. 10 closing.
 Many credited the silent hand of the Plunge Protection Team, so-called.
 It is formally the President's Working Group on Financial Markets.
 Its purpose is to stretch a safety net across the canyons of Wall Street...and arrest the plunging stock market before its encounter with pavement.
 Through executive order President Ronald Reagan fanned the thing into existence in 1988 – heavily in response to 1987's ""Black Monday"" plunge.
 But the stock market bounced several stories higher for the next six months – a period during which Enron toppled, incidentally.
 The Plunge Protection Team may interrupt a plunge. But can it send the plungee vaulting higher for six months?
 A net is not a springboard.
 James' study concluded before 2008. Thus the ensuing travails never came under his bifocals.
 Of course, the Federal Reserve's cosmic money-conjuring after 2008 – and again from 2020-2022 – likely negates all comparison to pre-crisis events.
 You have apples and you have oranges.
 Were you aware that since January 2020...the Federal Reserve manufactured some 80% of all Dollars in current existence?
 It is true. How many of them went piling into stocks? We hazard the number is handsome.
 Prior to 1988 at least, the stock market largely went along on its own steam.
 Not entirely perhaps. Yet largely. What are we to conclude?
 If James is correct, market shocks may prove less shocking than feared. From whom:
 ""The nation has nevertheless undergone shocks to the system that we have survived and will continue to survive.""
 We cannot dispute the first point. And we are consoled by the second point.
 Yet given the enormity of current financial and monetary arrangements...we cannot put away the suspicion that this system may not withstand the next shock.
 By our own admission, we yanked the same alarm in 2008.
 And in 1987. And in 2001. And in 2020.
 Each time our alarms proved false. The financial and economic systems absorbed the blows.
 The financial and economic system may well absorb the next blow.
 Yet the thing squats upon a foundation constructed increasingly of sand.
 And only a fool erects a house on sand."
2023-10-11,"Title:Weaponizing Migration
Article:The strategic manipulation of migrant flows...

 SAVVY investors are aware that geopolitical tensions and uncertainty can significantly influence the financial markets, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 That includes human migration – or, to be more specific, weaponized migration.
 Many of you, no doubt, watched Elon Musk's livestream of the historic US-Mexico border crisis last month on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. You may also be aware of the situation that's unfolding in the Mediterranean, with thousands of refugees from Northern Africa overwhelming Italy, prompting much-needed immigration reform.
 Both cases have raised questions about who's behind this global immigration surge.
 The tactic of using migrants as pawns is not new. Since at least the 1950s, bad actors have employed this strategy against liberal democracies like the US and Europe, which historically have tended to accept large numbers of refugees, according to Kelly Greenhill, author of the 2016 book Weapons of Mass Migration: Forced Displacement, Coercion and Foreign Policy.
 Back to the US-Mexico border. In August, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported a 36% increase in migrant encounters compared to July, totaling over 180,000 apprehensions. And last month, a staggering 50,000 migrants from crisis-stricken Venezuela illegally crossed the border, marking an all-time monthly record.
 
 The driving force? Beyond immediate socio-economic and political crises, deeper geopolitical manipulations may be at play.
 The Mexican government, for instance, has initiated a program to bus immigrants from the southern part of Mexico toward the USA. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently stated that around 10,000 people were reaching the border every day.
 Across the Atlantic, Europe – and Southern Europe in particular – faces parallel challenges. Between January and July 2023, the continent saw a significant increase in arrivals of refugees and migrants, totaling over 120,000 individuals, primarily through the Mediterranean and Northwest African maritime routes. This marked a 77% rise compared to the same period the previous year.
 
 The Italian island of Lampedusa has seen an overwhelming surge in migrant boats. On September 15 alone, some 7,000 people landed on the island, doubling its population and prompting local authorities to declare a state of emergency. This brought the total number of arrivals in Italy to nearly 126,000 in 2023, making it a significant political issue.
 As for the boats that migrants used to make the journey from North Africa to Italy, many appear to be expensive, high-end speedboats and other such vessels, clueing some observers in to the possibility that this sort of activity is being engineered to destabilize Western governments.
 Some immigration experts suspect that Russia could be behind the current crisis. According to the Heritage Foundation's Daniel Kochis, Moscow has employed and continues to employ the weaponization of migrants to manipulate the situation in places like Syria, North Africa and the Sahel, effectively pushing refugees toward European shores.
 Russia isn't the only country to have used this strategy. According to Judge Aaron Petty, an Appellate Immigration Judge at the Board of Immigration Appeals, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko orchestrated a crisis in 2021 by enticing thousands of migrants and asylum seekers – primarily from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan – to Belarus and then pushing them toward the European Union (EU) border, exploiting EU legislation and UN treaties for asylum seekers.
 Judge Petty believes the weaponization of migrants will increase, particularly by states like China and Russia. Such ""gray zone"" activities, including the manipulation of population flows, are aimed at shaping the strategic environment, destabilizing rivals and achieving objectives through means just short of direct warfare.
 Manufacturing an influx of migrants, or even just threatening to do so, has proven effective in the past in leveling the playing field with more powerful adversaries. It has created a bargaining chip and forces the engagement of targeted countries.
 Unless policymakers address the underlying dynamics that enable weaponized migration, the use of this tactic is likely to persist and expand, Judge Petty says.
 That's precisely what European policymakers are seeking to do. This month, EU diplomats reached a consensus on immigration policy reforms, following the resolution of a dispute between Italy and Germany over non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in the Mediterranean.
 The aim of these reforms is to enable EU states to respond in a unified manner to significant increases in asylum-seekers. A pivotal element of the agreement proposes the redistribution of migrants from countries with high influxes, like Italy and Greece, to other EU nations. Countries that opt out of hosting asylum-seekers would be obligated to financially compensate those that do.
 For investors, this is a sign that Europe is keenly aware of the risks and is looking to mitigate them. A stable Europe means a more predictable investment environment, especially in industries like tourism, real estate and manufacturing.
 The bigger question remains: will the US follow suit? The ongoing challenges at the US-Mexico border, combined with weaponized migration's growing prominence as a tool, mean that US policy decisions in the coming months will be crucial.
 For investors, this means staying informed, agile and ready to adapt. Government policy is a precursor to change, after all, and it's important to be prepared for sudden policy shifts. It's also wise to diversify investments across sectors and regions, hedging against potential disruptions such as weaponized migration.
 As always, I recommend a 10% weighting in gold, with 5% in physical bullion and jewelry, the other 5% in high-quality gold mining mutual funds and ETFs."
2023-10-09,"Title:Why China's Buying Gold
Article:Stocks, Yuan, real estate all struggling...

 The CHINESE YUAN has lost nearly 6% of its value against the US Dollar this year, writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.
 Shanghai-listed stocks are meanwhile off about 8% from their 2023 high, set back in May. There's an ongoing property crisis, with shares of Evergrande Group – China's second-largest property developer and the world's most indebted – halting trading after its founder and chairman was reportedly taken into police custody for unknown reasons.
 Against this backdrop, gold has emerged as a preferred investment alternative, acting as a hedge against financial volatility.
 Gold prices in China have soared as a result, hitting a historic relative high with a more than $100 premium per ounce over metal prices in New York or London, according to Bloomberg. Data showing a 40% hike in withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange and a 15% increase in imports in August further underscore this trend.
 
 Looking ahead, analysts predict sustained demand for the yellow metal amid not just a depreciating Yuan and shaky real estate market but also falling bond yields.
 The gold buying spree appears to represent an investment move – sales of bars and coins are up 30% compared to last year – but rising prices are also tempting jewelry buyers to make early purchases ahead of the busy Lunar New Year buying season.
 It's not just China's retail investors. The People's Bank of China also continues to diversify its reserves with gold, so much so that one expert believes total official gold holdings by central banks have touched a new all-time high. Jan Nieuwenhuijs, writing for Gainesville Coins, estimates that global gold reserves peaked at 38,764 tonnes in June, surpassing the previous 1965 record by as much as 400 tonnes.
 Nieuwenhuijs's estimate, which tries to account for unreported purchases, shows a notable increase in gold holdings since the 2008 financial crisis. This reflects what he calls a ""desire by central banks the world over to diversify away from the US Dollar with its ever more evident counterparty risks."""
2023-10-07,"Title:Treasuries, Gold and Guy Debord
Article:The Society of the Spectacle, 2023 edition...

 THIS is a financial market article that also delves into social commentary, says Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.
 The new macro, as exemplified by the 30-year Treasury bond yield surging higher, will bring change; both social and financial. The two are, of course, related.
 Here we do not come to firm conclusions, and so perhaps the article does not get picked up by some re-publishers. But in a time of change, I believe that the process of interpretation is more important than forming conclusions, just yet. Conclusions will be handled by trend followers, promoters and gurus, as they have been for decades.
 As for strategically operating in the markets, we (NFTRH, its subscribers and myself) are managing them quite well, in part because we are looking into the spectacle of modern society and the markets it encompasses and seeing the lies, bromides, falsehoods, promotions and outright grift within. But mostly we observe macro trends that have been broken, in service to being among the few that adapt to the changes promptly and successfully. Because we shall not be human commodities.
 When I was much younger, I was already dissatisfied with the automation and commoditization of human life (my main peeve being the relentlessness and omnipresence of the Ad man). With things of little real importance replacing sound ideals on what seemed like a mass scale, I felt very alone in my angst. Most people seemed not to mind the constant barrage and stoopidification of America.
 Then I had occasion to visit the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston to see an installation featuring the Situationist International (SI). It was not art. It was pure social commentary and it blew me away, probably because I was already going down that road at the time and it was nice to have my bias reinforced. :-)
 You can get a summary of the SI at Wiki, but an important aspect of their view is summed up per SI member Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle (SoS):
 ""Debord traces the development of a modern society in which authentic social life has been replaced with its representation: 'All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.' Debord argues that the history of social life can be understood as 'the decline of being into having, and having into merely appearing.' This condition, according to Debord, is the 'historical moment at which the commodity completes its colonization of social life.'
 SoS was written in 1967 by a man born in 1931. Things are exponentially worse now in a culture going full cartoon commodity, as one look at what America is obsessed with, or more to the point, what the Ad man wants America to be obsessed with, will bear out.
 Sure, it's fine to like entertainment. I like various forms of it (and abhor many others). But it's important to remain conscious, otherwise you are no longer Rowdy Roddy Piper (rest in peace) but instead, well, you know...
 Buy. Consume. Marry and reproduce. Conform. Accept that the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce hype is worth even 2 seconds of your time. Buy. Live. Reproduce...
 Rowdy Roddy Piper (on the current state of things):
 ""Just when they think they got the answers, I change the questions.""
 What, you expected ""I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum.""?
 The subject of automated thinking by a large proportion of the citizenry is relevant to the financial markets and in particular, this moment in time in the financial markets.
 Why this particular moment in time instead of all those moments in time that alarmists have noted for years and decades? Because something changed in a profound manner and is no longer in place as it was over those decades. But it's a pretty good bet that a vast majority of public market participants – when they can pull themselves away from the Swift/Kelce theatrics or our ever more cartoonish political arena (both sides of the aisle) for a moment – are still mentally riding the trend that ended in 2022.
 They have been riding the gentle downtrend of long-term Treasury bond yields and its pleasantly disinflationary signaling over decades dating back to the 1980s. Multitudes of market participants were not even born at the start of this trend. Multitudes have been tended and bred to obey the rules. Not to question. The thing we call Wall Street is an entity that wants to keep you stupid. Stupid and satisfied. Warm froggies in a pot set to medium. It'll eventually boil.
 That said, a market bounce now can come about if the recently spiking Gold/Silver ratio and recently steepening Yield Curves ease in the near-term, as we've been anticipating. But they and other indicators have made their initial moves. I believe any broad rally resumption will have a shelf life. The commoditized herds will take the bait again but likely not observe the warnings beneath the surface (for my part, I am collecting interest on cash, which is my overwhelmingly largest position, after covering some shorts in precious metals and broad indexes, and am lightly playing a bounce with favored stocks, including quality gold stocks).
 Back on the macro, it is super important that the bond market has signaled an end to the way business was done for decades. Said business was done by an all knowing, all controlling entity that is today going in the other direction. But is your financial advisor? Probably not. What about your Wharton educated active manager? Maybe, but probably not.
 Education can equal orthodoxy, which can be another way of saying ""stay in line, obey!"" Many of the best and brightest were bred by decades of a trend now broken. A RE-education of sorts from the cautious yet open minded thinking abilities that many humans are born with.
 Okay, time for more imagery. My edit of the formerly all powerful, all controlling Federal Reserve. Why formerly? Well, I can guarantee you that this bond market rebellion and the most recent inflation problem that spurred it on was not anticipated by our dear leaders. Don't take my word for it, take the word of the eggheads themselves:
 ""TRANSITORY""
 Transi friggin' tory! They used that word until they could use it no more lest they be completely discredited and debunked, even by the mainstream.
 Referring back to the 30-year bond yield, the Continuum's long down slope gave the Fed permission, even license to control the markets. Today, due to the bond market rebellion the Fed is sidelined and desperately trying to put the bond genie back in its bottle. But a trend has changed and so have the rules. Our job is to effectively interpret new rules and not only abide by them, but as speculators, profit from them.
 So I feel confident in having felt like a social outsider my whole life, because guess what? Being on the side of what was for decades the right side is not the right side anymore. If the bubble is not bursting it surely is taking on new shapes and dimensions.
 One important indicator of change is the fact that gold has not imploded on the state of 'real' 5 and 10 year Treasury yields. Historically, over the course of the Continuum's decades, this condition (implying tight monetary policy) was very detrimental to the gold price.
 If all were as it was, no way should gold be holding support and the channel bottom today, especially on a blow-out payrolls number. A deeply oversold condition and a logical support area could well be the final act of a gold-negative macro environment. It likely would not be the final act if the macro we had for decades were the macro we have today. But dear commoditized trend extrapolaters, it's a whole new ball game.
 There is much question as to whether the precious metals correction has ended. Don't let the touts likely to emerge on this broad market relief bounce convince you otherwise. But I expect the proof to come out in the pudding, perhaps before year-end. I expect gold stocks to shine after broad markets top out and gold stocks potentially (an important word, not a prediction) take one more leg down. Today the precious metals are rallying with everything else and that means they are not yet unique.
 One signal about when they will be unique? When gold stocks stop under-performing gold. That will come about when most of the macro stops out-performing to gold. Then the miners will leverage gold's standing within the macro and quite possibly put on a laser show not unlike the one that the 30 year yield has put on. For 20 years now the miners have under-performed with the declining yield as a guide. But the macro we had is not the macro we have.
 It's been a satisfying market to manage in the interim simply because, at the start of something new, the answers are not ready-made and information is no longer a commodity. It is a new thing altogether. We are called to the task of thinking for ourselves in order to succeed. The macro is churning out signals galore lately, including both new fundamental macro signals and interim plays in the other direction (like this week's broad bounce, which we anticipated due to index support levels and secondarily, depressed but not extreme sentiment).
 Meanwhile, the commoditization of financial market analysis will follow its trends that no longer are. Perfect."
2023-10-07,"Title:Asia's Giant Gold Buying Rises as Biggest Demand Season Starts
Article:India 'optimistic' for Diwali, China 'gold craze' continues...


              
           


The FESTIVE period for gold's largest consumer countries to buy the precious metal has begun with demand rising in the key markets of India and China as people take advantage of the current drop in prices.
           

              
           

             Last month saw the return of 'auspicious' dates for marriages on Hindu calendars after the seasonal summer shutdown, and November will bring India's peak gold-buying festival of Dhanteras, the start of Diwali. Western gift-giving at Christmas will then be followed by the run-up to Chinese New Year, starting on 10 February in 2024.
           

              
           

             Altogether, this festive period – covering the October-to-December and January-to-March calendar quarters – has seen consumers in China and India buy 8% more gold by weight over the past 10 years than they did across the April to September period on average, according to quarterly data from specialist analysts Metals Focus.
           

              
           

             That extra demand rises to 15% if you exclude the exceptional years of 2013 – when a crash in global gold prices spurred record-heavy buying in the precious metal's top 2 consumer markets – and also 2020, when Covid lockdowns crushed sales, from comparing Q4 plus Q1 against the figures for Q2 plus Q3.
           

              
           




              
           

             Having averaged a price above $1800 per Troy ounce in each of these periods since Q2-to-Q3 2020, global bullion prices jumped to average $1950 across mid-year 2023, denting India and China's demand amid 
            gold's typically quiet summer lull.
           

              
           

             But so far in October, global prices – as set by trading in the London bullion market – have fallen hard, down by more than $100 from that level at Friday's finish as 
            the crash in Western government bond prices drives longer-term interest rates sharply higher.
           

              
           

             ""Many consumers are frantically buying gold,"" reports China's 
            National Business Daily, saying that 
            the ""gold buying craze"" seen in the precious metal's No.1 consumer market ahead of the past week's Mid-Autumn and National Day holidays ""has not fallen but risen"" according to retailers.
           

              
           

             Bullion prices in Shanghai jumped a record $120 per Troy ounce above London's global gold price in mid-September as 
            China's rising gold demand met restricted supply, with household jewelry and investment purchases 
            ""running unstoppably hot"" according to the Henan News Channel.
           

              
           

             Gold's Rupee rates in India are meantime showing a premium of $5 per ounce to the cost of newly-imported bullion – which includes a massive 18% in duty and tax – the highest incentive for new inflows to the No.2 gold consumer nation in 17 months according to Reuters, thanks to rising demand and the lower global price.
           

              
           

             ""Retail and wholesale 
            demand is improving because of the price correction,"" the news-wire quotes one Mumbai gold dealer. ""We have been witnessing good traction in the last few days.""
           

              
           

             In China, where 
            the world's No.1 gold-buying central bank of the last 3 years has expanded the national holdings by nearly 8% since mid-2020, ""There are now a lot of people buying investment gold bars,"" NBD quotes a gold store salesman during the Golden Week holidays, ""because the price has dropped a lot.""
           

              
           

             But with China's Yuan gold price previously rising sharply over the past 12 months, ""It's hard to say what the impact will be on the post-holiday sales market,"" cautions Chen Biao, general manager of Swiss refiner Metalor's Chinese business.
           

              
           

             ""If the price continues to fall, it will have a greater negative impact on sentiment. But otherwise, consumers may buy gold on dips in the price.""
           

              
           

             As for India, the monsoon rainfall this year was slightly below average, says Metals Focus, but this is ""unlikely to impact crop output, which bodes well for India's precious metals demand, particularly jewellery consumption, as a large portion of this is concentrated in rural India.""
           

              
           

             ""Gold prices fall, retailers rejoice,"" 
            said a headline at the 
            Times of India as the global price fall took hold last week, adding to the ""optimism"" reported among gold dealers by 
            Metals Focus."
2023-10-03,"Title:Gold Bullion Finds Fewest Buyers in 4 Years
Article:Past week's gold price drop stems investor selling...


              
           


GOLD BULLION found the fewest buyers in more than 4 years in September, with investors as a group cutting their holdings for the first time since March,
             writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault, the largest marketplace for private investors to buy and trade physical precious metals.


              
           

             That came as interest rates on cash continued to rise and strong prices in Euro and UK terms spurred profit-taking. It's taken the past week's near-5% price plunge to stem that profit-taking. New gold investing demand looks unlikely to jump until something breaks in the wider financial markets.
           

              
           

             The Gold Investor Index tracks the number of people buying across each month against the number of people choosing to sell. It fell 2.0 points in September to 52.2, the weakest reading in 6 months but rallying last week from an interim reading of 50.7 as 
            gold prices dropped sharply.
           

              
           

             Even so, the number of people choosing to buy gold fell by 20.2% from the month before, hitting its lowest count since June 2019, while the numbers selling rose by the same proportion.
           

              
           

             The 
            Gold Investor Index set a decade high of 65.9 in March 2020 as the Covid pandemic and lockdowns crashed the global economy. A reading below 50.0 would signal more gold sellers than buyers among BullionVault users.
           

              
           




              
           

             While gold has retreated from the record highs reached on this spring's mini-crisis in US banking, and while prices have fallen hard over the past week, September marked gold's 9th highest monthly average ever in US Dollar terms, the 5th in UK Pounds, and the 3rd highest for Euro investors.
           

              
           

             The underlying strength in gold prices, plus rising interest rates on bonds and cash, continues to invite profit-taking among existing holders at the same as deterring new demand. This is likely to remain the picture until interest rates turn lower and/or the damage from today's high borrowing costs – the highest in 2 decades on the US Fed's overnight rate – suddenly becomes plain, spurring a rush for gold as investment insurance once again.
           

              
           

             As it is meantime, last month's selling on BullionVault saw investors as a group record their first net outflow of gold by weight since March, trimming 265 kilograms (0.6%) from August's month-end 
            record gold holdings – the 3rd all-time high in a row – to reach 47.9 tonnes, the lowest since April.
           

              
           

             Private investors also sold more silver in September than they bought as a group, cutting their holdings at BullionVault by 4.2 tonnes (0.3%) to 1,240 tonnes, the smallest in 15 months and 2.1% below last October's 
            record peak silver holdings.
           

              
           




              
           

             The Silver Investor Index held above 50.0 mark for the second month running in September, edging 0.5 points higher to 50.7 as the number of buyers fell 10.5% towards July's 4.5-year low but the number of sellers also dropped, down 22.9% to the fewest since February.
           

              
           

             As with investment gold bullion, the more industrially useful precious metal edged higher for UK and Euro investors, but silver prices failed to spike to multi-month highs as gold did."
