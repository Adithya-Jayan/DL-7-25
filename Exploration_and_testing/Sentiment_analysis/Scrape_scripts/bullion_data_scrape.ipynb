This sharp retreat confirms that bargain-hunting drove April's spike. But as with the Gold Investor Index, sentiment keeps trending upwards, marking higher highs and higher lows as the industrially-useful precious metal's underlying price continues to rise.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             On a 12-month basis, silver prices rose in May above $31 per Troy ounce for the first time since New Year 2013.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As for gold, its run of month-average gains has now made the strongest start to any year since 2006, matching the 5-month Covid Crisis run of April-to-August 2020 with the longest unbroken stretch of gains since the 8-month run ending in September 2011, the peak of gold's global financial crisis bullion market.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So while the Trump White House is promoting crypto, the uncertainty and volatility spurred by the President's policies provide the perfect backdrop for fresh gains in gold, making it the best-performing asset of 2025 so far.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That extends gold's market-beating returns across the 21st Century to date, confirming its appeal as a vital portfolio asset."

And while historical data say that silver prices typically swing harder and faster than gold, that's not true right now.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In fact, our analysis of the statistics shows that gold is now jumpier than silver by the widest margin since the 2001 terror attacks of 9/11.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Volatility is the way that analysts measure how jumpy an asset's price is, or isn't.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             High is bad, low is good. Or so investment managers think. Short-term traders like it the other way around. Because quicker moves make for fast money, if you call it right.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             There's a number of ways to track volatility. Our statistics use the standard deviation maths (just like most such analysis does), crunching the size of the price swings for gold and silver, day-to-day, across every 21-day period (ie, one month of weekday trading).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That number is then spat out as an annualized percentage...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...and the blue line in BullionVault's chart above simply tracks the difference between gold's rolling 1-month volatility and the rolling 1-month vol in silver.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As you can see, gold is usually less volatile than silver. Much less volatile. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Over the past 6 decades in fact, gold has shown 16.2% volatility on average. For silver, the data averages out at 28.8%.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This is why silver, famously, is known as \"the Devil's metal\". It's likely to jump or plunge far more often than gold...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...crushing any short-term traders who think they can guess which way it's going to swing next, most especially if they're betting with leverage through futures and options or CFDs and spreads rather than spot-market cash prices.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But who's the Devil's metal now? Because over the past month, the price of gold has swung more violently than silver.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That's rare. Since April 1968, when open-market gold prices were cut free from the Dollar's official value of $35 per Troy ounce, gold has been more volatile than silver less than 9% of the time. And over the past 2 decades, that statistic falls to just 1.1% of the time.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Indeed, up until late last week, the Dollar-price data say that gold hadn't been more volatile than silver since mid-April 2022...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...immediate aftermath of Russia starting its 'special operation' to invade Ukraine.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Back then, gold out-freaked silver by just 1.7 percentage points. Whereas this Monday, gold's 1-month volatility reached 12.0 percentage points above silver's if you track their London benchmark prices day-to-day.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That means gold has been out-freaking the Devil's metal by the widest margin since late-September 2001...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...immediate aftermath of Al Qaeda's 9/11 atrocities on New York and the Pentagon.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That terrible day coincided with gold prices finally finding their floor after a 2-decade bear market. (Lots of \n            other factors counted too, but it's \n            how history already likes to remember it.)\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Today, in contrast, gold has been soaring to fresh record highs, swinging lower only to set fresh record highs yet again, before swooning below $3200 this Wednesday.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So has the past month's dramatic gold price action marked a blow-off top for the 'safe haven' metal?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Maybe. But gold's sudden skittishness shouldn't spook investors out of the precious metal, not by itself.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Compare gold to the stock market, for instance. Yes, gold is currently out-freaking the S&P500 index by a wide margin. Day-to-day over the past month, its volatility is a hefty 14.3 percentage points higher.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But over the past 5 years, gold has been less volatile than that major US stock index almost 2/3rds of the time...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...only out-pacing the stock market's volatility 37.3% of the time on our analysis of London 3pm vs. the New York close.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Silver, in contrast, has been more volatile than the S&P index nearly 9/10ths of the time (89.1% to be exact).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So while gold's sudden freak-out might give some newer investors the jitters, it's got a long way to go...plus a whole heap of history to overcome too...before it gets anywhere close to matching the volatility of the stock market, never mind silver prices."

Gold Reserves By Nation\nArticle:Data and charts for today's Top 10 largest gold buyers and holders...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nCENTRAL BANK gold buying is a vital factor in the global gold bullion market today.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n              Over the past 5 years, central banks as a group have chosen to buy almost 1 in every 8 ounces produced by global gold mining. Their demand outweighed inflows to gold-backed ETF investment products more than 5 times over.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              In fact, the total quantity of gold now reported to be held in national central-bank reserves – shown on BullionVault's interactive data table and map below – today accounts for 17% of all the gold ever mined in all of history.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Which countries lead this central-bank gold buying?

But none of those counties top the table for outright gold reserves holders. Not yet, and not on the official data at least.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Get the full picture of the world's largest central bank gold buyers and holders with these interactive map and tables.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n Top 10 countries by gold reserves 2025\n\n              Gold continues to be a cornerstone of financial security for many nations in the 21st Century, especially in times of global uncertainty. Over the five years to 2025, central banks around the world have continued to bolster their bullion reserves as a hedge against inflation, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical instability.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              But which countries hold the most gold? Explore all the \n             gold reserves data in detail at the bottom of the page.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n USA\n\n              Official data for the start of 2025 says that the United States continues to lead the global gold rankings with a massive \n             8,133.5 tonnes of gold held in reserve. Against its population of close to \n             340 million, this translates to an average of \n             23.9 grams of gold per person, worth almost $2200 per head at gold's early 2025 prices. Despite no change in reserve volume over the past five years, that per capita figure underscores the scale of America’s longstanding investment in gold as a strategic asset. The consistent volume also reflects the Federal Reserve’s conservative approach to its gold policy.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Germany\n\n              Germany’s gold reserves amount to \n             3,351.6 tonnes, maintaining its position as Europe’s top gold-holding nation. With a population of just over \n             83 million, this equates to an impressive \n             40.2 grams per person. This high per capita figure reflects Germany’s deep-rooted trust in gold as a store of value, managed by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Although the tonnage has dipped slightly from 2019, the country's commitment to gold remains firm.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Italy\n\n              Based on Italy’s official data for the end of 2024, its gold holdings stand firm at \n             2,451.9 tonnes, unchanged from five years earlier. With a population nearing \n             58.9 million, the country enjoys a strong \n             41.6 grams of gold per capita, one of the highest ratios in Europe. This consistent reserve level demonstrates Italy’s continued reliance on gold as a key component of its national financial security, overseen by the Banca d’Italia.\n            \n\n               \n            \n France\n\n              France holds a substantial \n             2,437.0 tonnes of gold, virtually unchanged from five years ago. With a national population approaching \n             64.8 million, this amounts to around \n             37.6 grams of gold per capita. Managed by the Banque de France, the country’s long-standing commitment to gold underscores its strategic role in safeguarding monetary stability, even as public interest in gold fluctuates.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Russia\n\n              Russia has, on its publicly stated data, boosted its gold holdings to \n             2,333.1 tonnes, reflecting a steady rise from its start-2020 level. With a population of approximately \n             144.4 million, this equates to \n             16.2 grams per capita. Though not the highest on the list, Russia’s strategic focus on increasing its reserves over time points to a broader effort to bolster economic independence and reduce exposure to foreign currencies.\n            \n\n               \n            \n China\n\n              China’s gold reserves grew significantly to \n             2,279.6 tonnes by the end of 2024, marking a continued upward trend in accumulation. However, with a vast population of over \n             1.42 billion, the country still only holds \n             1.6 grams of gold per person, one of the lowest per capita levels among major reserve holders. This disparity highlights the impact of population size on per capita figures, even when total reserves are high. But it might also be contradicted by the widespread view among gold-market analysts that Beijing is most likely growing its gold holdings faster than it reports in public, cutting its exposure to the Dollar and other US assets in favor of bullion.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Switzerland\n\n              Switzerland remains a global outlier when it comes to per capita gold, with \n             1,039.9 tonnes of gold reserves shared among just \n             8.8 million people. This results in an impressive \n             118.2 grams per person, by far the highest gold-per-head ratio in the world. Despite a referendum in 1999 voting to end the Franc's formal gold-backing in law, the Swiss National Bank’s commitment to maintaining large reserves of bullion reflects Switzerland’s historic role as a haven of financial security and independence.\n            \n\n               \n            \n India\n\n              India’s gold reserves rose significantly from 635.0 to \n             876.2 tonnes over the past half decade, a 38% increase in just five years. However, with a population of more than \n             1.43 billion, this results in just \n             0.6 grams of gold per person. While the per capita figure is small, the growth in reserves signals the Indian authorities' recognition of gold’s role in supporting national economic resilience and diversifying financial assets. That appeal is already well-known by India's private households, the 2nd largest buyers of the precious metal behind China's household sector.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Japan\n\n              Japan’s gold reserves increased to \n             846.0 tonnes by the end of 2024, up from 765.2 in 2019. With a population around \n             123.3 million, that gives the country a modest \n             6.9 grams of gold per capita. While not among the highest, this figure reflects Japan’s cautious and balanced approach to reserves management, with gold playing a supporting role alongside foreign currencies and other assets.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Netherlands\n\n              The Netherlands maintained its gold holdings at \n             612.5 tonnes as of New Year 2025, nudging the Central Bank of Turkey out of the Top 10 on BullionVault's analysis because, on its reported figures, Ankara counts a large portion of Turkey's commercial bank gold holdings among its sovereign reserves. With a population of about \n             17.6 million, the Netherlands shows a healthy \n             34.8 grams of gold per capita, placing it among Europe’s more robust gold-per-head nations. As with Switzerland, the consistency of its reserves reflects a long-standing national strategy focused on fiscal conservatism and stability.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Who is buying the most gold among central banks and why?\n\n              At the start of the 21st Century, all of the Top 10 central bank gold nations were 'legacy' holders, sitting on massive reserves built during or in the years following World War Two.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Led then as now by the United States, eight of those Year 2000 giants were in Western Europe, and the other was Japan. Whereas today, Russia comes in 5th place, with China in 6th and India in 8th.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              In fact, Turkey would be in 10th position, ahead of the Netherlands, if we counted commercial-bank gold holdings − needed to back their customers' gold investment accounts − as part of its sovereign-state reserves like the central bank in Ankara does on its official data.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              What changed to drive this surge of non-Western gold buying?\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              First came the early 2000s' rush of globalization. It poured Western consumers' cash into emerging-market nations' central-bank reserves, buying gas and crude oil from Russia plus manufactured goods from China and India. It also coincided with ill-advised gold bullion sales by many Western nations, made at what proved to be the eve of gold's dramatic 21st Century gains to date.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Then, around 2010, the US and European financial crisis saw emerging-market central banks buy gold to spread their portfolio risk away from the Dollar. That move has since continued, but with a sharp geopolitical edge, since Russia was hit by Western financial sanctions over its invasions of Ukraine, first annexing the region of Crimea in 2014 and then attempting to take the whole country since 2022.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              That has seen demand to buy gold for national central bank reserves spread among many smaller nations. Because Washington and Brussels have, in the eyes of many, chosen to 'weaponize' their currencies as a tool of geopolitical control. Gold, in contrast, is no one's to control through bank clearing systems or outright default. So it shines as a way of diversifying exposure to the Dollar, to the Euro, and to the political actions of Western governments.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n China\n\n              The world's 7th largest economy in US Dollar terms in 1999, China jumped to 3rd place on the GDP league table within 10 years and then overtook Japan, closing the gap with world No.1 economy the USA to less than 50% by 2014 and then to barely 30% last year.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Driving that economic growth, China has built a giant manufacturing sector and earns a huge trade surplus against the rest of the world. Today it ships out over 14% of all merchandise exports by value, but it buys less than 11% of global imports. To pay for the gap, other countries – led by the USA – must send huge quantities of currency to China to get the goods that they want. That has enabled the central bank in Beijing to build massive reserves of foreign currency and bonds, led by the US Dollar.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              China's FX reserves at the People's Bank are so huge, its massive gold holdings still accounted for just 5.5% of the total in US Dollar terms at New Year 2025. But that ratio has more than doubled over the past 20 years as Beijing more than tripled the weight of its gold bullion reserves to reach more than 2,270 tonnes on the official data.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              That makes China the 6th largest national gold holder, with analysts believing that the vast bulk if not all of its gold is stored domestically. But do those figures understate China's true bullion reserves?\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Many analysts believe China's national gold bullion holdings are larger than the reported total, perhaps twice the size if you compare the country's visible private-sector demand against its gold mining output and bullion imports. The excess supply must have gone somewhere, and the People's Bank has in the past kept the changes in its gold holdings a secret, \n             suddenly announcing huge increases in its gold reserves.\n            \n\n               \n            \n India\n\n              For a country with such a deep and famous love for gold, India began the 21st Century very shy about buying any gold for its central-bank reserves. But looking to diversify its foreign-exchange reserves as economic growth in the world's most populous nation accelerated, the Reserve Bank of India in late 2009 bought a massive 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\nIndia's 2009 gold purchase was the largest increase in its national gold holdings on record. It cost the central bank $1045 per Troy ounce, then the highest gold price ever. The very same level then became the final floor for the gold prices when the market slumped in 2012-2015. Perhaps that proves – as several analysts had noted – that the staff at India's central bank really do \n             know a thing or two about gold.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              After the 2009 purchase of IMF gold, the RBI kept its record-large gold reserves unchanged for 8 years, focusing instead on trying to boost the Rupee's exchange-rate value while building its holdings of US Dollars and other foreign currencies. Indeed, there was discussion about \n             selling or lending some of India's gold to help the central bank defend the Rupee, something it had done two decades earlier.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              But the officials in Mumbai then began to buy gold regularly from the end of 2017, adding almost 320 tonnes since then to take the Reserve Bank of India's total reported bullion reserves to the 8th largest worldwide among national central banks. Over 27% of the total has been added in the past 5 years alone, as our table shows.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              What's more, India has recently joined another key central-bank gold trend – repatriating some of its gold reserves from abroad, and keeping more of its bullion at home.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              More on this geopolitical trend and the reasons behind it below.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Poland\n\n\n               Trailing the monster gold buyers of China, India and Russia, three members of the European Union have also shown strong appetite for central-bank gold reserves over the past five years, led by Poland.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               While some of \n              Warsaw's gold buying appeared politically motivated under the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), Poland's gold purchases have continued since they lost power in 2023, adding another 89.5 tonnes last year alone.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Hungary and the Czech Republic have meanwhile more than doubled their gold reserves since the start of 2020, eve of the global Covid pandemic. Like Poland, they are due to join the single Euro currency at some stage. But for now, they continue choosing the safety of gold bullion as a key monetary reserve.\n             \n\n\n               \n            \n Countries doubling their gold reserves\n\n              Other countries doubling the weight of their gold reserves since the end of 2019 include Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in eastern Europe, major African gold-mining nation Ghana, EU and Euro member Ireland (albeit to only 12.0 tonnes), plus Middle East states the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Russia\n\n              As with China, the Central Bank of Russia is believed to keep all its gold bullion domestically, rather than holding much if any abroad.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Also like China, there's debate over the true size of Russia's government gold holdings. But on the central bank's official data, Moscow now holds the world's 5th largest national gold hoard after choosing to buy almost 2,000 tonnes for its reserves over the last 20 years.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              That gold-buying spree took off as the price of oil and gas – which make up half of Russia's total exports and account for almost 1/5th of its entire economic output – began rising in the 'commodity supercycle' of the early 2000s. Boosting Russia's GDP as well as Moscow's tax revenues, the country's trade surplus with the rest of the world also spurred a jump in the central bank's reserves of foreign currency, most of all the US Dollar.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              At the same time, Vladmir Putin – then as now President of Russia – called for the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) to increase gold's share in its foreign-exchange reserves, and he also called for greater investment into Russia's gold-mining industry. The country has since moved from 5th position to No.2 among the largest producer nations, almost doubling its annual gold mine output by weight.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              As a major supplier to the global bullion market, Russia's gold miners hit a big problem when Western sanctions hit the country's banking sector after its invasion and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. Those US and EU sanctions meant Russia's gold miners couldn't easily access the international market to sell their output. So after reporting no sales and only purchases between 2007 and 2012, the Central Bank of Russia accelerated its \n             relentless campaign of gold buying in 2014-2018, paying domestic mining companies with Rubles to buy 80% of their output.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Russia's huge gold accumulation means that it accounted for more than one-third of all national central-bank gold buying worldwide since 2004. But Moscow's dominance has slipped, sinking below 4% of the sector's net demand over the last 5 years while China accounted for 20% and India 14%, with Poland and Turkey both on 13%.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              First, that's because other countries began buying gold during the Western financial crisis of the late 2000s. Russia's accumulation then slowed because of the 2020 Covid Crisis, when the plunging price of crude oil hit Moscow's tax revenues and forced the Ruble's foreign exchange rate lower. Thirdly, Moscow's war on Ukraine then hit the Russian state's finances and international liquidity reserves as the US, UK and EU authorities have tried to lock it out of the global financial system.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              The CBR initially said it \n             wouldn't buy any domestic gold output, but it relented as Western sanctions hit both Russia's mining industry and its own ability to grow its reserves of non-Ruble assets.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Why do central banks buy and hold so much gold?\n\n              \"Gold,\" says a research paper co-written by monetary historian Barry Eichengreen in 2023 and published by the IMF, \"appeals to central-bank reserve managers as a safe haven in periods of economic, financial and geopolitical volatility.\"\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Because those stresses have worsened so far in the 21st Century, gold's appeal has only grown for many central-bank buyers, as you can see on this interactive table (click the column headings to sort the table).\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Overall, the total quantity of gold held in national central-bank reserves has increased almost 19% by weight over the past 20 years – and it has jumped 7-fold in US Dollar value to $2.5 trillion – led by Russia, China, India, Turkey and Uzbekistan.\n            \n\n               \n            \n How much gold does the UK have?\n\n              The UK held \n             310.3 tonnes of gold at the end of 2024, unchanged from 2 decades before, when it ended a heavy gold-selling program which coincided with the bottom of the precious metal's long bear market. With a population of approximately 67.7 million, this works out to just \n             4.6 grams of gold per person, a relatively low figure when measured against other leading Western nations. Despite the modest reserve size, the UK's gold is securely managed by the Bank of England and plays a supporting role in the country’s foreign reserves portfolio.\n            \n\n               \n            \n Why are UK gold reserves low?\n\n              The United Kingdom’s low gold reserves can largely be traced back to that controversial decision made between 1999 and 2002 \n             when the UK government sold more than half of its gold holdings at historically low prices. Instead of accumulating gold, the UK has focused its reserve strategy on a \n             diversified basket of foreign currencies and other financial assets, viewing gold more as a hedge than a primary store of value. \n            \n\n               \n            \n\n Uses of gold FAQs\n\n\nWhat is gold used for in jewelry?\n\n\n\nGold has been used in jewelry for thousands of years primarily due to its appearance and natural lustre that doesn’t diminish over time due to gold’s inertness and resistance to tarnishing. Pure gold is relatively soft and easy to craft into delicate and intricate pieces and can also be combined or alloyed with different metals to change its colour and hardness.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is investment grade gold?\n\n\n\nThe global wholesale gold investment market, centred in London deals in the London Good Delivery gold bullion bar. This London Good Delivery bar weighs 400 troy ounces - about 12.4 kilograms - and is about eleven inches long. It is stamped on the top (the larger face) with the manufacturer's name, the weight, and the assayed purity. The minimum specified fineness must be 99.5% pure gold, but improvements in the refining process mean that Good Delivery bars now reach 99.99% purity or higher.\n\n\n\n\nIs gold jewelry subject to VAT?\n\n\n\nIn the UK gold jewelry is subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) at the standard rate of 20%. In the UK gold jewelry is considered a consumer good much like a mobile phone or TV. However, investment grade gold bullion in the form of London Good delivery bars or investment grade coins and small bars can be bought and sold free of VAT.\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of gold is used for investing?\n\n\n\nSince 2010 the percentage of gold used for investing has averaged 29%. 2013 saw the lowest investment percentage at 18% and in 2020 during the Covid pandemic the percentage of investment gold peaked at 49%. If you include Central Banks reserves as gold investment of sorts, then between 2022 and 2024 this reached 23% of gold demand.\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of gold is used for technology?\n\n\n\nBetween 2010 and 2024 the percentage of gold used in technology has averaged 8% with little variation over the past decade. In comparison over the past 15 years gold used in jewelry has accounted for 50% of total gold demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n\n Central Bank Gold Reserves"

         "Title:When Tariffs Do Good\nArticle:Today's US underinvests and overconsumes...\n\n WITH so much attention focused on US stock markets, it seems timely to pivot away from stocks for the moment and consider the global perspective, writes Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.\n Globalization may be dying in terms of trade and supply chains, but financial markets are inextricably linked in ways that relatively few understand.\n The Dollar still dominates the global financial system despite the cracks in the foundation and the valid criticisms. If there's a Dollar problem in Eurodollar banks, it's sure to echo from Tokyo to Shanghai and New York. And problems in those locales affect everything else.\n I continually urge people to get away from their desks, stop staring at screens and go out and talk to real people. There's no substitute for walking the streets around the world (including the poorest areas) if you really want to know what's going on.\n I've just returned from separate visits to India, Japan and Jekyll Island, Georgia. India has the largest population in the world, has the fifth largest economy, is a nuclear power and a key member of BRICS. Japan is the fourth largest economy in the world and is a key geopolitical ally of the United States in its faceoff with China. Jekyll Island is a lovely ocean resort but is best known as the site of a secret meeting in 1910 where the Morgan, Rockefeller and Warburg interests dreamed up the Federal Reserve System.\n While India, Japan and Jekyll Island could hardly be more diverse and geographically scattered, they share a common thread. It's their economic linkage through the US Dollar. The following are some impressions I gathered during these visits that reflect the volatile situation facing markets today.\n For Trump's new tariff policies, responses varied from retaliation tariffs (proposed by Canada, China and the EU) to a much more reasonable approach of simply asking the White House for a meeting to sit down and discuss the issue amicably with a view to lowering tariffs in both directions. Japan and India fell into this latter category and are being rewarded by being included among the first countries that will actually have that opportunity. (Mexico has also taken the moderate route by engaging in discussions rather than retaliation).\n There will be some give and take. Some US tariffs on certain items are likely to remain in place. But the optimal solution is not to cut down on US purchases from those countries but for them to buy more from the US.\n That trims the US trade deficit without reducing world trade and so constitutes a win-win resolution with both India and Japan. India will likely buy more military hardware and semiconductors from the US Japan will likely buy more agricultural goods including soybeans and beef. The result will be higher growth in the US.\n Bilateral deals like this have losers. Taiwan may miss out on some semiconductor sales (although they are investing hundreds of billions of Dollars to build semiconductors in the US). Russia may miss out on military sales to India although they will remain a major energy supplier. Still, the US is done being the \"consumer of last resort\" to the world and wants to increase its profile as a seller. Trump's policies move the US in that direction.\n There is little question that the new US tariff policy will hurt some countries around the world. Not to sound harsh, but that's their problem. Trump's job is to make America great again. President Xi's job is to make China great again. Chancellor-in-waiting Merz's job is to make Germany great again.\n The US cannot carry the world on its back. If other countries (rich or poor) took Trump's growth-oriented approach instead of free riding on America, the entire world would be better off. That's certainly the view from the White House and is a good guide to US policy going forward.\n Defenders of China point to the fact that Chinese exports are not a particularly large percentage of their total GDP. (Germany is the worst offender by that metric). The problem with that data point does not come from the Chinese export number; I'm sure that's roughly correct. The distortion comes from the GDP denominator. Chinese GDP is overstated by 100% (at least) perhaps more, and China may already be in a recession.\n The reason is that China shows about 45% of its GDP as investment, mostly in the form of government backed construction. I've been to the ghost cities in China and seen more on the horizon. I got mud on my boots on the construction sites (except I was wearing Italian loafers). There is real steel, glass and copper in the buildings and it takes real labor to build them. That all counts as GDP.\n But they're all empty. If you used GAAP or international accounting principles, you would write that investment down to zero immediately. You can't put a ghost city into inventory. Buildings age rapidly and take enormous amounts to maintain. I saw this in the Congo in the early 1980s. They had a commodity boom in the 1970s and wasted much of the money on skyscrapers and other showcase projects.\n By the time I arrived there, the windows were falling out and rust stains ran down the sides of their showcases. The same thing will happen in China. Once you make that accounting adjustment for wasted investment, GDP shrinks, and the Chinese export/GDP ratio goes up exponentially. China is much more dependent on exports for any real growth than most analysts realize. Trump and Scott Bessent have this right.\n Tariffs are not automatically good or bad for an economy. Their impact depends on initial conditions when the tariffs are imposed. Tariffs are a tool that should be applied judiciously. A country that overinvests and under consumes will be hurt by tariffs. The tariffs will increase investment and restrain consumption, making the imbalance worse. That's what happened to the US under the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs in 1930 and later.\n A country that over consumes and underinvests will benefit from tariffs. That's the situation in the US today. The tariffs will increase investment as foreign and domestic investors build new plants behind tariff walls. Tariffs will channel consumer Dollars from consumption into savings, which is also desirable. In the end, consumption will expand not because of cheap imports but because of high-paying US jobs.\n China is in the category that overinvests (much of it wasted) and under consumes. China's best strategy would be to lower its own tariffs and allow its people to spend their savings on imported goods from the US and EU along with their own production. That would reduce China's trade surplus with the US, increase China's GDP and improve the well-being of its own people. It would also make an excellent opening move in any effort to get the US to reduce its tariffs on China.\n The US is making good use of tariffs. China is doing the opposite. China may be fighting to a draw in the rhetorical war, but it will definitely lose the trade war. Japan, India and Mexico are models of how to make progress. China is the poster child for how to fail.\n Global supply chains will no doubt be disrupted by the tariff and trade wars now erupting. Reconfiguring supply chains will be a one-to-two-year transition. But once it's done, the new supply chains will prove durable. Volkswagen blundered badly by putting its new Audi Q5 plant in Mexico. Their US sales are booming right now (beat the tariffs!) but will fall off a cliff once dealer inventories are drained and tariffs apply. Still, that's a management blunder not a global disruption. Supply chains are adaptable with a lag. US soybeans will soon be on their way to Japan if China doesn't want them.\n As an aside, Elon Musk's shelf life in the White House pantry will soon expire. Musk sparked a pointless feud with White House trade and manufacturing czar Peter Navarro. I know Peter fairly well (a conversation with him is like a graduate level oral exam but that's another matter). When Elon attacked Navarro, he messed with the wrong guy. Navarro took a bullet for Trump by serving four months in a federal penitentiary rather than answer a subpoena that sought to pierce the veil of executive privilege between the two. That's the kind of loyalty Trump respects. Navarro also happens to be right about tariffs despite Musk's whining.\n With regard to the Federal Reserve System that emerged from the swamps around Jekyll Island, the Fed has fallen into complete irrelevance. They have modest impact on the short-end of the yield curve (Treasury bills) but have no material impact on the intermediate- and long-end of the yield curve (Treasury notes and bonds).\n US national debt and spending will never be brought under control. But sustainable growth can be stimulated by sound fiscal policies, if not by the Fed. As long as nominal growth is greater than nominal debt increases, then the US debt-to-GDP ratio will shrink. That's the simple formula behind Scott Bessent's Three Arrows plan and it can feed on itself in a virtuous circle.\n What the Fed and the Treasury have done (mostly under Biden) is to create a global Dollar shortage, which is now morphing into a global liquidity crisis. China is not dumping Treasuries because they're distancing themselves from the Dollar. Quite the opposite. China is selling Treasuries because they're desperate for Dollars and can't get them from Japanese banks who have their own problems with carry trade unwinds.\n The liquidity crisis then goes back to European banks who can't fund in EuroDollars and US hedge funds who can't find collateral to support their derivatives basis trades. India is not immune.\n The best description of a financial crisis I've ever heard is that \"Everybody wants his money back.\" We're dangerously close to that situation right now. If it gets worse, trade, tariffs and stock markets will be a sideshow. Watch Treasury yields and foreign exchange markets if you really want to know what's going on."

         "Title:Silver Investing Leaps Fastest Since Covid\nArticle:Silver buyers +108% on price plunge... \n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nSILVER INVESTING demand just leapt at its fastest pace since the Covid Crisis, \n            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             The surge in demand came as \n            the price of silver − which finds more than half its end-use globally from industrial and tech applications, over five times the proportion for 'useless' safe haven gold − fell hard from new multi-year highs, only to rebound as US President Trump back-tracked on some of his 'Liberation Day' trade tariffs.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Across the first week of May, investors who had used BullionVault's live 24/7 marketplace to buy securely-stored \n            silver at early April's sudden 6-month lows would have been offered net gains of 15.9% (11.6% for UK Pound investors, 11.8% in Euro terms).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Those gains would have been impossible for anyone buying bullion, small bars or coins outside professional storage because of those 'retail' units carrying dealing spreads as wide as 10% plus VAT sales tax as high as 20% in the UK and Europe.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             What drove April's surge in demand to invest in silver?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             While gold prices had stolen the headlines with a run of new records in 2025, silver quietly rose to its highest Dollar prices since the global financial crisis, plus \n            fresh monthly silver price records in Euro and Sterling terms across February and March.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But US President Trump's shock 'Liberation Day' trade tariffs then sent silver prices reeling, spiking down like no time since the initial Covid Crash in world stock markets and commodities prices of March 2020.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             With silver prices spiking lower, the number of investors who chose to buy silver across April more than doubled from March. It jumped 108.0% on BullionVault's low-cost platform to the most since March 2021.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The number of silver sellers meanwhile slipped 11.2% to the fewest since December last year. Together that sent the Silver Investor Index − BullionVault's unique measure of sentiment, calculated back to New Year 2012 − soaring by 7.5 points to 58.3.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That marks the highest reading in 49 months, thanks to the steepest month-on-month jump in the Silver Investor Index since March 2020's series-record rise of 20.4 points.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Any reading above 50.0 means that buyers outnumbered sellers across the month. The Silver Investor Index set a series peak at 75.1 as the Covid crisis first struck in March 2020, and it set a series low of 45.0 on March last year's record-heavy profit-taking.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             What next? April's surge of silver investment demand hasn't yet run into May. That's because it came thanks to silver prices spiking lower, just as happened in spring 2020. And longer-term, this spike in silver demand also followed nearly 2.5 years of net selling when prices rose and investors took profit, with sellers outnumbering buyers ten times on the Silver Investor Index across the previous 29 months.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Silver investment by weight also leapt last month, totaling 17.8 tonnes net of customer selling. That was the heaviest 1-month buying since February 2021's net demand of 25.3 tonnes − an inflow driven by the \n            #silversqueeze ramp on social media.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This April's big silver inflow took BullionVault clients' total holdings − all securely stored and insured in each user's choice of London, Singapore, Toronto or (like gold, most popular) Zurich − up to a 7-month high above 1,160.5 tonnes.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That contrasts with gold, where \n            half-a-tonne of net selling last month shrank BullionVault clients' total holdings to the lowest quantity in almost 5 years, just beneath 43.8 tonnes, on the heaviest net liquidation since March 2024's record 1-tonne of gold profit-taking.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But by value, gold holdings set a fresh all-time high once again, rising to $4.6 billion (£3.4bn, €4.0bn). The drop in silver prices, in contrast, meant that the surge of investor demand still put client holdings 3.9% below March's record high in US Dollar terms, down at $1.2 billion (-6.9% in GBP to £900 million, -8.5% in EUR to €1.0bn).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Looking ahead, and whether or not the US-China trade war is resolved quickly, Trump's tariffs shock is likely to weigh on global trade and economic growth. The President's policies against green energy also present a headwind to silver, because the solar-energy sector worldwide has accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in total industrial demand to new record highs over the past decade.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So while it's driven long term by the same inflationary and geopolitical tensions as gold, the price of the gray metal is more vulnerable to economic anxiety, as well as enjoying long-term demand growth, because of \n            silver's strong industrial uses. That made silver 40% more volatile day-to-day last month than the safe haven metal, offering larger gains to short-term traders but also carrying more risk."

         "Title:New Gold Investing Jumps 121% But Price Trumps Trump\nArticle:Gold profit-taking heaviest since last March's record...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nGOLD's latest run of fresh record prices met the most new investors in over four years in April. But it also spurred the heaviest profit-taking, net of demand, in more than 12 months on BullionVault, \n            writes Adrian Ash at the world-leading marketplace.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Now caring for a record $4.6 billion of securely-stored gold (£3.4bn, €4.0bn) for its global clientbase − nine-in-10 of whom live in Western Europe or North America − BullionVault saw the number of investors choosing to buy gold for the first jump 56.0% last month from March's figure, and it rose 121.6% from April last year to reach the most since February 2021.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But the volume of gold selling leapt again, leading to the 5th heaviest net monthly outflow by weight since BullionVault's live 24/7 marketplace opened 20 years ago.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So while \n            Trump's chaotic return to the White House has spurred a new wave of investors buying gold for the first time, the record gold prices which his policies have prompted are meeting heavy profit-taking from existing owners.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That includes investors who first chose to buy gold earlier this year, seizing a quick profit as the surge in prices trumps longer-term fears over the impact of Trump's policies. Indeed, 2025's new gold buyers were 70.0% more likely to sell in April than investors who began buying gold during the previous five years.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             And why not? Anyone choosing to buy gold on BullionVault in January, February or March was, on average, offered a gain in US Dollar terms of 10.7% last month net of all costs (6.2% in UK Pounds, 4.0% in Euros).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Across BullionVault's total client base in April, the number of people starting or adding to their gold holdings rose 26.5% from March's figure to the most since February 2021, depths of that winter's Covid wave and lockdowns.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The number of sellers meanwhile rose by 51.1% to the most since March last year's record high, when a surge in Chinese demand and trading drove global gold prices sharply higher.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Together that put the \n            Gold Investor Index − our unique measure of sentiment based solely on actual trading behaviour on the world's largest marketplace for personal gold investment − at 54.8 in April.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Higher by 0.2 points from March and 3.2 points above April last year, that reading was 1.2 above the index's prior 12 months' average. Any figure above 50.0 means that buyers outnumbered sellers on BullionVault. The Gold Investor Index set a decade peak of 65.9 as the Covid crisis struck in March 2020, and it set a series low of 47.5 on March last year's heavy profit-taking.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But while the count of investors choosing to buy gold this April outnumbered those who chose to sell for the 13th month in a row, the quantity of selling outweighed demand by almost half-a-tonne (452 kilograms), the widest margin since March 2024's record 1-tonne outflow (992kg). That reversed more than five times the net inflow made in January-to-March (86kg) − the \n            first quarterly inflow since Q2 2023 − with BullionVault users taking profit on more $46 million of gold (£35m, €41m).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So with gold's new all-time highs destroying jewelry demand worldwide as Western investment remains muted net-net, this bull market is being driven by China's latest gold investing surge, plus the ongoing bid from central banks wanting to cut their exposure to US assets, most especially the Dollar.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             A new wave of private investment in Europe suggests similar anxiety, and April's surge in first-time investors was led by the UK, Spain and Germany, where April's inflow of new users rose 121.8%, 147.5% and 66.9% respectively above their prior 5-year monthly averages. But while the number of new US buyers was, comparatively, quiet once more in April, it did rise 45.9% month-on-month and finally joined all Western European nations in topping its previous 5-year monthly average (+39.8%). That's something not seen in four years outside of April 2023's 'mini banking crisis' and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Meantime, the President's back-tracking on tariffs (and on firing US Fed chairman Jerome Powell) have seen some of the heat coming out of the gold price. But the damage done to the Dollar and to America's long-term investment appeal only adds to the appeal of gold as an all-weather hedge against geopolitical and financial volatility."

         "Title:Trump at 100 Days, Gold at $3300\nArticle:A history of debasement at the federal troughs...\n\n TIME flies. We're already past the 100th day of President Trump's second term, writes Byron King in The Daily Reckoning.\n One piece of good news is that America's southern border is as secure as it's ever been in modern times. Trump and his people fixed that wide-open, Biden-era problem quite fast, by the novel approach of applying existing law. Amazing! Who knew?\n Now the country doesn't have to deal with 10-15,000 new arrivals every day, unknown, un-vetted people from all over the planet who just walk in and immediately become a burden on the country's broken budget.\n On the other side of the political ledger, the economy is weakening, something we predicted in articles going back deep into 2024. And many federal judges have decided to wage lawfare on the 47th President, itching for a so-called \"Constitutional crisis\" that they will blame on Trump.\n Overseas, international tensions remain high; Eastern Europe, Middle East and East Asia all speak for themselves. There's nothing easy about any of those problems, and they cost money that the country can ill-afford just now.\n All this, and last week the price of gold hit $3500 per ounce before receding to the low-$3300s price range. So gold is moving; but will it head upwards or is a pullback in the cards?\n In this note, let's discuss Trump and gold, but mostly gold.\n On 20 January, when Donald Trump took his oath of office, the gold price was $2725 per ounce. Now, after 100 days it's about $3325, an upward move of 22%.\n Correlation is not causation, as I learned many years ago in statistics class, but Trump still owns some of that move.\n Let's time-travel a decade ago to mid-2015 when the New York businessman dove into national politics and announced his run for the presidency. Back then, the price of gold was just shy of $1200 per ounce. And over the past 10 years gold has moved up by about 177%.\n Of course, Trump alone doesn't move the price of gold. Sure, he was President for four years, 2017-21. Then, he was not President for four years; and in fact, from 2021-25 he spent much of his time as a professional defendant in multiple court cases.\n Now he's back in the Oval Office at the three-plus month marker. But c'mon, man...all sorts of things move gold prices.\n In this regard, it's more accurate to say that the price of gold reflects global-scale perceptions of the inherent (and declining) value and utility of US Dollars; and yes, Trump definitely sways perceptions.\n That is, if world markets perceive that the US economy is strong and things look good for the future of America, then gold prices tend to moderate; they find a range. But if markets sense weakness in the US or its economic future, then the price of gold rises.\n Again, Trump plays a big role in all of this, but he's only one factor among many.\n To help understand the moves in gold prices, let's do a quick (I promise) history lesson. We'll start in 1914, with a standard $20 coin called a \"St. Gaudens\", named after the designer.\n This coin had a bit less than one ounce of gold in it (30.093 grams to be exact), along with a small measure of copper to harden the alloy. When it was minted 111 years ago, this item was worth a face value of $20, and the gold was also worth $20. In other words, and to channel the ghost of long-deceased tycoon J.P.Morgan, \"gold was money\" back then, and twenty Dollars bought an ounce of gold.\n If you're wondering why I chose 1914, it's because that was the first year of the US Federal Reserve, meaning America's central bank. President Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on 23 December 1913, literally in the dead of night, during a holiday period in a nearly empty Washington D.C., which tells you much about how the Fed came into being.\n Then as 1914 unfolded, and in one of the Fed's first official acts, it issued so-called \"notes\" among which some were valued at $20.\n The note specifically stated: \"The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand Twenty Dollars.\" Meaning yes, you could take this to a bank and exchange the paper for a gold coin.\n Today, you might be forgiven to think that the note itself is itself $20. But no, that's not the case; that 111-year-old item is definitely not $20, it's just a promise. Again, that's because long ago, \"twenty Dollars\" meant an ounce of gold, ideally stamped into the shape of a coin.\n To nail the point, in 1914 gold was real money; paper notes were just promises, even those issued by the Fed. That's even if, as in the case above, the US government was the promisor who guaranteed payment in gold.\n Which brings us back to last month's gold price rise, up above the $3500 line, and then the subsequent pullback to the current level around $3325.\n Do the math. At $3325, you now need over 166 Federal Reserve $20 bills – like those that you get from the local ATM machine – to buy an ounce of gold; and that's just the gold, not allowing for any numismatic value to an old, rare coin.\n Look at it this way; over the past 111 years, the Dollar has shrunk in purchasing power and its ability to preserve wealth by a factor of 166. Or stated in another way, a penny from that 1914 era is now worth $1.66.\n The value-loss of the past century had nearly nothing to do with President Trump. Indeed, for that decline in the Dollar's value we can thank many Presidents: Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Roosevelt (Franklin), Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush (H.W.), Clinton, Bush (W.), Obama, Trump (first term), Biden...and now Trump 2.0 at his 100 day mark.\n Generation after generation, President after President, the US government routinely engaged in deficit spending. This is certainly the case since 1971, after President Nixon essentially tore up the World War II-era Bretton Woods agreement which kept the Dollar tied to the value of gold. Since then, federal spending, deficits and the national debt have mushroomed.\n Now the nation owes unpayable levels of national debt, around $37 trillion. That, plus something approaching $2 trillion in interest due every year, a sum which cleans out most of the cash in the Treasury's accounts. And it's axiomatic that the annual federal deficit is paid with borrowed funds, including what gets paid as interest on past debt. All in all, our national accounting scheme is a highway to ruin.\n To compound the matter, current American culture doesn't seem to know what to do with itself absent massive federal spending, particularly deficit spending which is sewn into the social fabric of the country.\n For many decades, Congress has been institutionally incapable of cutting the budget. Politically, there are few accounting priorities in Washington; they fund just about everything. And we almost never program terminations except for a few of the most grievous military procurement boondoggles.\n More recently – the past 100 days – we've witnessed the nation's collective inability to deal with spending cuts. Consider the apoplectic, psychotic reactions in many quarters to federal spending freezes and shutdowns. Or to state it another way, we hear the sound of rice bowls being broken.\n For example, we have Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which in just three months has torn through one federal agency after another. DOGE cut budgets, laid off staff, closed offices and more. And predictably, the mainstream media went nuts while people across the Republic went to court, seeking a friendly federal judge to issue an order blocking the President from not spending money that, at root, the country doesn't have.\n Did Trump cut too many things, too much, too fast? Hey, argue it any way you want because it depends on what's in your rice bowl. Does America need most of what, say, US Agency for International Development (USAID) was doing? Does the country need the Department of Education? And so on; there's a long list and no need to detail it here.\n Then again, at an even higher plane, can Trump ever begin to \"cut\" enough spending to save the financially foundering ship of state? So far, Trump has eliminated perhaps $200 billion in federal expenditures, but the number ought to be ten times that size. Good luck, right?\n The problem is that for better or worse, every federal Dollar is someone's income. So when federal spending declines, it's money no longer in someone else's pocket. It's no wonder that house sales are down, airlines are selling fewer tickets, hotels are booking fewer rooms, auto dealers are selling fewer cars, and so on.\n Whether Trump is President or not, the fact is that the country is painted into a fiscal and monetary corner. There's too much debt and interest, and not enough cash to pay for it absent inflating the currency. Sure, Captain Trump has rearranged some deck chairs on the Titanic, but the ship is still sinking based on a century of federal policy and misallocation of the country's resources. Face it, there's no nice, clean, easy, pretty way to fix what's broken.\n Now, here's one final point, which is that gold is slowly remonetizing. The world is moving towards a revised gold standard, and away from American petroDollars of the past half century. Yes, it's happening under Trump but this trend was happening in any event, Trump or not.\n Start with the gold price over the past 5 years. On the chart, you'll notice the upward trend in gold prices that began in mid-2022 during the Biden administration; in fact, it occurred not long after the US government seized and froze massive amounts of Russian sovereign wealth, at the time locked up in Treasury bonds. That is, the US weaponized its currency, its banking system, and even its underlying basis of government finance.\n In response, the world reacted as one might imagine; central banks bought gold, the price of which has moved from $1750 to the recent $3500 level, a double in under three years. And don't be misled, it was central banks that bought large blocks of metal. Gold's big move was not due to retail buyers down at the coin shops, nor hedge funds, banks, family offices, etc.\n For three years, central banks unloaded Dollars and derisked their long-term holdings. This reflects their collectively negative future perceptions of the US, its economy and strength. Frankly, it doesn't matter that Trump is now President. Central banks were buying gold in 2022 when Trump was battling state and federal prosecutors who wanted to toss him into jail.\n That is, Trump had nothing to do with what kicked off the 2022 upward move in gold prices, a rising tide on which we're now floating. Yes, Trump's recent on-again, off-again tariff policies have created confusion. His budget and spending priorities are still in formation. But that's not what elevated gold to $3500 last month.\n Gold didn't spike up because the metal is somehow shinier or denser, or because the future of the US economy looks brilliant. Gold moved up along trend lines that are three years in the making.\n The bottom line is that many people who control vast amounts of wealth realize that America's fiscal and monetary house is totally dysfunctional and unsustainable. The US budget is broken, the national debt is unpayable, the interest will kill the Treasury account.\n Will gold keep going up? Yes, of course, it's hard to see why not. Own gold or you'll live to regret it.\n Sure, expect pullbacks along the way, certainly during market sell-downs and especially if/when there's a crash. We may again see gold under $3000, but not for long. Some things are bigger than one President and his term in office. The US is over a century getting into the current mess, and we'll be many decades digging out. You had better own some gold as it all plays out."

         "Title:Silver Ratio Dive Bombs vs. Gold\nArticle:Might silver's low price to gold signal a surge ahead...?\n\n NO REVERSAL yet in the Silver/Gold ratio, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole, flipping the more common Gold/Silver Ratio on its head, the better to measure silver in terms of the less useful 'safe haven' precious metal.\n In fact, quite the contrary as the ratio makes its 5th day fading after a spike last week.\n The Silver/Gold ratio, in other words, remains extremely depressed. That in itself is not a big deal. It's a normal consolidation of the spike.\n But the nominal silver price, which had been conspicuously strong above its 50-day moving average despite the correction in gold and the miners, is slipping said level.\n If that is an indication of things to come, the sector correction should continue and other areas in commodities/resources could come under renewed pressure.\n\n A reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio would trigger a positive market for commodities/resources.\n The question is, will the recent dive bomb in the silver price vs. the gold price prove to be a pivotal event, as it did in 2020? Will a reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio come from this drop?\n If so, given relatively less downside intensity than 2020, I'd expect the upside to be highly tradable, but more moderate (sorry my silver buggish friends).\n (By the way, above, and outside of the P-51 Mustang, the Junkers JU87 'Stuka' dive bomber was this WWII fighter dork's favorite of the era. It's a bomber, but work with me here. It was so awkward and clumsy.)\n Silver, with more cyclical industrial utility than gold, would lead if inflationary pressures build up and/or renewed enthusiasm against a coming recession/bust were to manifest.\n Further implications would be for strength in the precious metals miners, despite a currently in-process healthy pullback, and further weakness in the US Dollar, which has been bearish for the entirety of Trump's term.\n As a side note, USD is due for a bounce or rally. But \"due\" implies a time variable.\n Meanwhile, the TSX-V index, home of the most speculative Canadian commodity/resource related stocks, has ticked a new high for its bottom/upturn cycle. The 'V' seems to think silver will take over from gold, potentially providing a backdrop for wider commodity participation.\n Only time will tell if this will play out, but it's interesting goings-on in a macro stimulated by an awful lot of geopolitical input."

         "Title:The Reality of Trump's Coal Economics\nArticle:Fossil fuels below 50% of US electricity output...\n\n BETWEEN raising and lowering tariffs on imported goods, President Donald Trump made time to sign an executive order aimed at reviving America's \"beautiful clean coal industry\", writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.\n The order outlines an ambitious strategy to reclassify coal as a critical mineral, reopen federal lands to mining, fast-track environmental reviews and provide federal support for coal-fired electricity and coal exports.\n The move comes at a pivotal time. Demand for electricity is surging as the US seeks to reindustrialize and build out new infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, electric vehicles (EVs) and high-performance computing.\n According to S&P Global, the US will see greater electricity demand growth in the next decade than in any ten-year period in history.\n \n Shares of Peabody Energy − the largest US coal producer, responsible for mining over 104,000 short tons in 2023 − closed up 9.21% on the Tuesday of Trump's big tariff crash bounce.\n That was the company's best one-day increase since 6 November 2024, the day after Trump won his second term. Over the longer term, however, Peabody's stock has plummeted, losing close to 60% of its value since Election Day.\n \n I admire the President's focus on strengthening US energy security. Reliable, affordable power is the bedrock of economic growth and national competitiveness. While I understand his intent, I believe the long-term investment case is moving in a different direction − and it's one that leans heavily toward renewables.\n Coal is often described as a powerful energy source, and indeed it helped build the industrial age. But today, coal is struggling to compete on cost. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for new coal plants is more than double that of solar, wind and natural gas, according to BloombergNEF. And that's before factoring in the environmental and public health costs of coal extraction and combustion.\n The simple truth is that coal is no longer the cheapest or cleanest option.\n \n The market knows this. Coal's share of power generation in advanced economies has been in steady decline since it peaked in 2007, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n In the US, coal fell below 15% for the first time ever in 2024, and the trend is accelerating. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) projects that the remaining 115,000 megawatts (MW) of coal capacity could be shuttered by 2040. Nearly a quarter of the existing US coal fleet is already scheduled to retire by 2029.\n Many of the plants still online are operating far below capacity. Reopening closed plants, or extending the lives of aging ones, is highly inefficient. Maintenance costs increase with age, and many units are now over 50 years old. The last large coal plant built in the US came online in 2013, and since then, the pipeline has run dry.\n It's no secret that the global energy makeup is transitioning. Coal generation hit a new record high in 2024, largely due to growth in emerging markets, but even in China and India, two of the world's largest coal consumers, ambitious plans are underway to increase cleaner energy. China led the world in solar additions in 2024, while India is scaling up renewables to meet its growing energy needs.\n The US saw coal consumption fall 4% last year, on top of a 17% drop in 2023. Meanwhile, renewables are setting new records. Just last month, US wind and solar generation hit an all-time high of 83 terawatt-hours (TWh), while fossil fuels' share of the electricity mix fell below 50% for the first time ever.\n It's clear where the wind is blowing. I believe this trend represents an attractive investment opportunity.\n Renewable capacity additions around the world surged by 25% last year, led by solar and wind. Solar alone is expected to account for more than half of all new generating capacity in the US this year, with my home state of Texas leading the way. More than a third of all new solar panels is expected to be installed right here.\n What's even more compelling is that renewables are now cheaper not just than building new coal plants − they're cheaper than operating most existing coal plants. According to Energy Innovation, 99% of US coal plants could be replaced with new solar or wind at a lower cost.\n Again, I agree with President Trump that AI and data centers will be massive energy consumers in the coming years. As executive chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, I should know. Between now and 2030, electricity consumption by data centers alone is set to more than double to an estimated 945 TWh. Pinning our hopes on coal to meet those needs is a backward-looking solution, I believe.\n Coal may see a temporary boost from regulatory relief, and some investors may profit in the short term. But in the long run, I think the writing is on the wall. The global transition to cleaner, cheaper energy is well underway. Investors who want to stay ahead of the curve should follow the data and the money."

         "Title:US Trade: The Real Story\nArticle:Ignore the Harvard men...\n\n PETE NAVARRO is in the news, writes Bill Bonner at The Daily Reckoning.\n He is believed to be the 'architect' of Trump's tariff policies. Fox:\n \"White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on US imports would not be enough for the administration to lift its new levies announced last week. 'Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters,' Navarro said on CNBC's Squawk Box.\"\n Say what?\n Even with zero tariffs Vietnam would still be subject to 'reciprocal' charges from the US? How could Vietnam eliminate the 'non-tariff barriers?' Make sure its currency doesn't go down against the Dollar? Change its tax policies so they do not encourage exporting?\n Would it have to give up what Adam Smith called its 'comparative advantage' − cheap labor − and raise wages to the US unionized standard, with all America's labor protections, over-time pay, holidays, and pensions?\n Will oil rich nations have to compensate for having cheap energy? Cold nations will have to pay a penalty for not needed A/C? Will warm ones need to apologize for their bananas?\n White House experts don't actually analyze any of those things. They just look at trade volumes. So, the only way they will know if Vietnam is not 'cheating' is if the balance of trade is even.\n By this formula the US was a cheater from 1875 to 1971...it ran trade surpluses in all those years. It had a very efficient, advanced economy. Should it have been punished for that?\n It was only after Nixon changed the world's money system that the deficits began...and never ended. The new 'fake' Dollar − that the US can effectively 'print' at will – is the cause of America's chronic trade deficits, not NTBs.\n The real story: after 1971, the US could buy what it needed with its inexhaustible new money; it didn't need to compete.\n Navarro is said to have a PhD in economics from Harvard. This makes us very suspicious of Harvard's standards. But Harvard has figured prominently in US history. Usually disastrously.\n In theory, the role of a Harvard education – we get this first-hand from sharing our marriage bed with a Harvard grad for the last 41 years – is to discipline the mind so it thinks with rigorous logic, and furnish it with enough literature, history and science to give it something to think about.\n How then does a man like Pete Navarro end up with a PhD from that august institution? Perhaps its standards have slipped?\n A bastion of privilege, power and positivism, Harvard cultivates a pernicious weed – the person who believes he can use his brain to know what others should do...and use the government to make them do it. Sprouting from seed in Cambridge, the weed spreads...and soon has covered the ground all the way to the Potomac.\n Trump was looking for an economic advisor. His son-in-law reportedly found Navarro's book (perhaps then on the remainder table, along with our forgotten classic \"Empire of Debt\").\n In 'Death by China' the author frequently quotes another Harvard guy, Ron Vara. The only problem is that there is no Ron Vara. He is Navarro's made-up alter-ego. In effect, the 'Death by China' theme is supported by two Harvard men – one fictional, both delusional.\n And now word on the street is that Ron Vara is butting heads with Elon Musk. Here's Politico:\n \"In the early hours of Saturday morning, Musk took to his social media platform X to launch an apparent attack at the President's senior trade counselor, taking jabs at Navarro under a video in which he explained the Trump administration's logic in levying tariffs during a CNN appearance. The Department of Government Efficiency head replied to another user's comment on the video lauding Navarro's explanation, writing of the economist: 'He ain't built shit'.\"\n Then, Elon's brother joined the scuffle. Business Insider:\n \"Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of Elon Musk, said on Monday that President Donald Trump's slate of reciprocal tariffs would be like imposing a 'permanent tax' on US consumers.\"\n The Musk team and the Trump/Navarro Team are not on the Same Team. Musk represents real economic interests...Trump is politics incarnate.\n Tariffs are a political move...part demagoguery, part cupidity. They make politicians more powerful as they get to choose who pays what to whom. And they make a few insiders richer as they favor some industries over others. But ultimately, they weaken the economy and make everyone else poorer.\n Eventually, the two teams are going to come to blows. And maybe sooner than later. Newsweek:\n Musk's open criticism of White House policy is the first time that the relationship between himself and Trump has appeared to be strained.\n Musk:\n \"A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing. Results in the ego/brains>>1 problem.\"\n More to come..."

         "Title:Forget the Fed, Don't Fight the Yield Curve\nArticle:Too late already. As always...\n\n The BOND market's yield curves imply a dovish Fed to come, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n But the Fed will sit on its ample behind for as long as it takes for it to finally act on the message.\n Eventually the Fed will be dragged into action; dovish action. Much like the Fed was compelled, despite its tardiness, to finally fight inflation with hawkish action on the last cycle, as we noted in real time back in that phase.\n The effects of the inflation problem created by the Fed and government in 2020 could have been less severe had the Fed gotten off its ass and addressed the problem sooner. Instead, it held off in paranoid fashion until it was sure the asset bubble in equities, which it was blowing, was in full flight.\n Was this political? I can't comment. But the inflation was birthed under Trump and it was sustained way too long under Biden (with Janet Yellen riding in the side car as Treasury secretary).\n Fast forward to today. CME Group's FedWatch tool − which I have come to realize is not the skilled forward prognosticating entity many think it is (it all too often reacts to events and indications in real time) − sees a 70% chance of a Fed Funds rate hold in May. Although it also sees an 87% chance of a cut by one or two basis points in June.\n On April 7th we noted that the Yield Curves were painting the Fed \"behind the curve\". That was due to the 10-year-minus-3-month curve lagging the 10yr-2yr. On April 9th we reviewed the Yield Curve steepener, indicating an economic bust in the not too distant future.\n Proof, you demand? Here it is.\n Historically, Yield Curve steepeners have never failed to bring on recessions to one degree or another at some point, usually after the steepener has expressed itself for several months. The current steepener need not necessarily bring on a recession just yet. But it is very likely coming. The shaded areas on the chart were the recessions of yore.\n \n The yield curve anchored by the 3 month T-bill is more heavily influenced by the Fed's status (holding), and the curve anchored by the 2 year Treasury note is more subject to a (relatively) freer bond market.\n But while the Yield Curve anchored by the 2-year Treasury Note continues on its steepening way, it is dragging the 10-3 chart directly into the fight and thus, it is dragging the Fed into the fight.\n The concept of short-term Treasury yields declining in relation to longer-term Treasury yields (the definition of a curve steepener) means gathering risk-off sentiment in the markets (well, that's been obvious even to those who don't know what a yield curve is) as capital flies toward the safest liquidity in short-term Treasuries and T-bills.\n This is not a discussion about gold, the ultimate risk-off asset in times of liquidity stress. Gold is and has been just fine, when it was languishing below 1100 per ounce. a few years ago and when it is booming to new highs today. It is insurance and safety in a way that bonds, the debt of sovereign nations at economic war, are not.\n Insofar as we are discussing bonds, this is the kind of pressure that will drag the Fed into action, probably whenever the current stock market rally (favored view is that it is a bear market rally) ends."

         "Title:Some Confirmation Bias\nArticle:Plus some initial forecasts for Trump 2.0...\n\n TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 2.0 – this time, with real tariffs – has just made landfall, says Tim Price at Price Value Partners.\n The market focus (aka projectile vomiting) has primarily been on stocks, but like other commentators, we suspect the real story is taking place in the bond market.\n Here is investment consultant Jeremy McKeown's take, as at 7th April 2025, via Linked-In:\n \"Asian markets fell high single-digit percentages overnight as trade war fears increased over the weekend.\n \"Safe havens include the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and gold, all relatively resilient.\n \"Everything else is being torched.\n \"Trump cheerleaders from last year, such as Bill Ackman, have condemned the Trump tariff policy, and even Scott Bessent's mentor Stan Druckenmiller spoke out against it.\n \"The Donald remained unphased, saying he hadn't checked his 401(k) this weekend and compared his policy to necessary medicine.\n \"While the headlines focus on the global traded goods sector, a more meaningful analysis might be on the capital and liquidity flows these tariff moves have set in motion.\n \"As Bessent has said, he is the US's biggest bond salesman, comparing his most pressing job to securing the pilot doors on US commercial aircraft before 9/11. While Ackmann and Druckenmiller have capital at risk that, like others, is being liquidated, Bessent worries about the Treasury 10-year yield and the federal debt burden.\n \"What is clear is that this phase will pass. However, portfolio risk adjustments are necessary.\n \"The narrative for the recovery is still in production; it will centre on a collapsed oil price, lower interest rates, an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, some DOGE successes and massive supply-side reforms, including evidence of inward investment into the US economy.\n \"Of course, none of this is sure to work; otherwise, investors would be happy to hold their nerve. After all, human nature fears loss twice as much as gains; the adjustment can continue for some time.\n \"The new administration has achieved its objective of removing the Trump Put. It needs to collect funds into its safe-haven Treasuries before it executes a pivot back to risk.\n \"However, every stage of this process is fraught with danger.\"\n In an earlier post from the weekend of April 5th/6th, Jeremy made the following comparison:\n \"This is America's Brexit. This is when global investors re-assess their belief in American Exceptionalism, or at least the price they are being asked to pay for it. As with Brexit, rational economic man cannot comprehend the degree to which some are prepared to take short-term pain for their longer-term ambition. In this case, the price the US administration is prepared to pay to restore manufacturing jobs to Detroit and the wider US rust belt. This is MAGA 2.0 in action and damn the torpedoes!\"\n We agree. The original Brexit vote marked the point at which British blue-collar workers issued a definitive vote of no confidence in the globalist experiment, complete with offshoring, a hollowing-out of traditional industry, and unwanted mass migration, known as the European Union.\n Predictably, this vote was ignored by the so-called elites in London and Brussels. Trump 2.0 may prove a harder nut to crack.\n Trump doesn't (personally) have to worry about re-election, so he can spend some quality time as a wrecking ball of change, and seizing the nettle of the US' unsustainable debt load. Whether by accident or design, and probably the latter, tariff chaos helps lower US sovereign borrowing costs in a year when roughly $9 trillion will mature or need to be refinanced.\n We happen to think that the damage done to US sovereign creditworthiness and credibility by the Biden administration egging on the freezing of Russian foreign reserves was and is irreversible: that particular genie is not going back in the bottle.\n So we remain of the view that the future involves a concentration on real assets as opposed to the illusion of fiat ones. So in turn we are more than happy to keep the faith with regard to gold, silver and sensibly priced miners, notwithstanding the elevated volatility that Trump 2.0 has injected into the markets.\n Here is what the retired wealth manager Clive Thompson, again via Linked-In, expects. Irrespective of some perhaps inevitable confirmation bias, we also tend to agree:\n \"Tariffs! You feel you should DO something? Read this first. This is a step-by-step guide to what we can expect for stocks, bonds, the economy and gold.\n 1) America imposes tariffs. 2) Some foreign nations respond with retaliatory tariffs. 3) Stocks fall; recent purchases show losses. 4) Worst hit are exporters to the US, US importers, and high P/E growth stocks. 5) US sellers shift money into deposits, money-market funds, T-Bills, and T-Bonds. 6) Foreign sellers do the same with domestic equivalents (eg, gilts, OATs, Bunds). 7) Gold and silver hold gains thanks to central bank buying. 8)\"Buy-the-dip\" investors sell gold to buy stocks. But stock rallies are brief. 9) Nervous foreign nations reduce US Treasuries, buy more gold, undeterred by price. 10) Prices rise, wages don't. Everything costs more. 11) With limited funds, people cut spending on both US and foreign goods. 12) Global consumption drops. Economies contract. Stocks are falling. 13) Some businesses fail. 14) Many see reduced profits or slower growth. 15) Asset allocators, analyzing losses, see gold would've improved portfolio Sharpe ratios. 16) Portfolio managers begin adding gold. 17) Layoffs rise. Unemployment climbs. A global recession follows. 18) Perversely stocks are rising strongly from the bottom. Stocks are already anticipating central bank stimulus. 19) Slowing economies reduce tax revenues, partly offset by US import tariffs. 20) Governments borrow more to cover shortfalls and rising social costs. 21) Central banks blame consumer price rises on a \"one-off\", not underlying inflation. 22) They lower interest rates multiple times to try and boost economies. Longer term Treasury yields remain stubbornly high. 23) With fewer surplus Dollars from lower exports, foreign nations buy fewer US Treasuries. 24) Americans buy some, but only at higher yields. Treasury prices fall, yields rise. 25) Higher yields raise debt servicing costs. 26) The Fed becomes lender of last resort, prints money to buy T-Bonds − like in 2008 − 2011 and 2020–2023. Foreign central banks follow. 27) We have global QE. 28) More money boosts economies. Stocks rise. Gold soars.\"\n In a financial world experiencing genuine chaos and wild tectonic shifts, there is the possibility that the secular bull in the monetary metals and real assets has only just begun.\n We can live, quite happily, with that."

         "Title:Back to 1909 with Trump's Tariffs\nArticle:Global trade war explodes...\n\n OUCH, says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.\n Global markets are in freefall in response to President Donald Trump's universal 10% tariff on all goods being imported into the US, with as many as 60 countries facing \"reciprocal\" tariffs on top of that.\n When we combine all new tariffs in 2025 so far, including the raft of reciprocal tariffs announced last Wednesday, we're looking at an average effective rate of 22.5%, according to Yale's Budget Lab.\n That's the highest such rate since 1909 − the same year that President Howard Taft proposed the idea of an income tax to Congress.\n \n As I have pointed out before, tariffs are a type of tax paid for by domestic import-export companies, who often pass the additional cost on to consumers. This can turbocharge domestic inflation.\n Tariffs can also lead to full-blown trade wars, as we saw in the federal government's previous attempts to raise revenue through the taxation of imported goods.\n The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, enacted in 1930, is widely believed to have exacerbated the effects of the Great Depression, as global trade tanked a whopping 65%. A few decades prior, then-Representative William McKinley's tariff act triggered retaliation from other nations, leading to higher prices for US consumers.\n (If you need to brush up on your Smoot-Hawley history, I recommend the famous \"Anyone? Anyone?\" scene in 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off.)\n As was the case then, we're already seeing retaliatory tariffs. China announced that it will impose a 34% duty on all goods imported from the US. If this weren't enough, automobile imports face a steep 25% tariff. Trump claims he \"couldn't care less\" if foreign manufacturers raise prices for US consumers, and from the looks of it, they may need to − and significantly so, in some cases.\n Mitsubishi, for instance, will need to increase the price of its vehicles by more than 20% here in the US to offset the new levy, according to estimates by CLSA.\n The manufacturer expected to fare the best under this tariff regime is Tesla, whose supply chain is well-integrated in the US. More than 62% of the company's facilities are located domestically, with approximately a quarter of its suppliers also based in the US, according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, fewer than half of Ford's facilities worldwide are currently located in the US.\n This could be constructive for Tesla, whose stock has lost over half of its value since its peak in mid-December, making it one of the worst performers of the year so far. The carmaker's quarterly sales fell a significant 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due mainly to political backlash against CEO Elon Musk.\n When it comes to new home purchases, bad economic news could be good news. Mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 4% on Friday due to concerns about the trade war. Bond yields generally fall when prices rise.\n Granted, home prices in the US are still hovering near record highs, but current homeowners may be able to refinance sooner than expected.\n Lower yields are also good for gold. Because it's a non-interest-bearing asset, gold starts to look more attractive as yields fall, especially when inflation remains historically elevated, as it is now. The 10-year yield is nominally 4.1% right now, but when you factor in the 2.8% headline inflation rate from February, the real yield is closer to 1.3%.\n If yields fall further or if inflation jumps higher due to tariffs, we may end up with negative real yields, which have historically been bullish for gold prices.\n The yellow metal is trading down as it's swept up in the broader selloff, and I believe investors should strongly consider buying these dips. Gold just notched its best quarter since 1986, ending March at $3123 per Troy ounce, and there could be further upside momentum."

         "Title:Spanners, Wrenches, Steepener and Gold\nArticle:Cue gold's perfect macro to strike...\n\n A MAN sits in the White house, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n A different kind of man. A man who does not like diplomacy or going along and getting along with his global counterparts. He likes throwing spanners and monkey wrenches all around the macro.\n There may one day be revealed a positive outcome to this, through negotiations. But on the face of it, nobody wins a tariff war. Least of all the biggest consumerist nation on the planet.\n Ignore the media panic. It's all noise. It's real, but for the sake of where we are going – and have been indicated to be going for over a year now – it is noise. Recession signals kicked in when yield curves steepened and de-inverted. Always disregard the media's view on yield curves, which in 2023 was that the deep inversion meant imminent recession. The media harvested many eyeballs with that ill-conceived fear campaign as the economy remained firm and the \"boom\" side of the boom/bust continuum, well, continued.\n It's the subsequent curve steepener that gets ya. We married other indicators to the yield curve view in 2024 for a clear picture of an oncoming recession, economic counter-cycle and waning of confidence. These are primary considerations for a bullish fundamental view of the counter-cyclical gold mining sector.\n I used the Macrocosm (the larger the planet, the more important the fundamental consideration for gold stocks) for all too many years to illustrate why a proper and sustainable macro backdrop was NOT in place for gold stocks. For much of the last year it has increasingly confirmed, rather than denied a positive backdrop for gold mining.\n From 2004 to 2024 the economy was boosted by inflationary policy-making more often than not. And every downturn (most dynamically, in 2020) was met with balls out policy. Hence, Jupiter was never allowed to engage beyond quick events, as policymakers reliably sprang into action to mop up the situation with interest rate and bond market manipulation, the mechanics of money printing and inflation.\n \n Saturn came into alignment as yield curves aborted their deep inversions and began to steepen in 2023.\n Then last year, they de-inverted (an economic boom runs with a flattening toward or to inversion, a bust runs with a steepener) and the coming economic down cycle came closer into view. Saturn fully engaged when gold's ratio to the last inflated man standing, the S&P 500, busted upward just recently.\n The Gold/Silver ratio is a wild card as silver can sure lead the precious metals complex. But speaking purely as a fundamentalist, gold rising in silver terms is more aligned with proper gold mining fundamentals, since silver has much more cyclical/industrial utility than gold.\n All the other planets are in fine form as well. A couple notes:\n\n Some planets should be larger (but I had to work with the art I had). Specifically, Stagflation, which is a very viable outcome of a global trade war.\n Cyclical Inflation and China/India Love Trades are provided because there were two tiny little planets that needed to be assigned a level of importance. That level is minuscule and is really just for comic relief, especially when you think about promotional interests out there touting these elements as serious gold stock fundamentals to their herds.\n The bottom line is that we are now in the Macrocosm, some 12 years (+/-) after I came up with the pictorial view of what we would look for to be real fundamental gold mining bulls. It is fully engaged.\n\nGold miners (GDX) had been a card carrying member of the broad stock market rally until the election slammed the counter-cyclical sector on Trump economic optimism. As the realities of the initial destructiveness of a global tariff war become more widely known, the counter-cyclical sector has rallied while the cyclical stock market has tanked. Makes sense, folks.\n Don't over-think it. The gold mining case dearly needed gold to outperform the stock market and that is what is happening. By extension, so too are the miners now outperforming the stock market.\n \n Using the monthly chart of HUI, we have noted a painfully volatile bull market that began in 2016. You may recall that back then, by mid-year the initial launch was doomed because silver was leading gold, then commodities and stock markets. It was an inflationary move for the macro. WRONG setup! Silver bugs led the charge and the whole cacophony topped out that summer, after we noted the degrading fundamentals as the pumpers pumped.\n Since then Huey has ground its way to a low in 2018, a high in 2020, a low in 2022 and voila, here we are on a wave 5. It is likely that HUI will pause or pull back here at or above resistance. Our minimum target has been to make a higher high to 2020's 373. The operating target of 500 may not be the ultimate target. It's just been the objective we've had since bottoming out at '4'.\n Unlike in 2016, the proper backdrop is in play. What we have developing now is a deflationary situation. Why, just look at Treasury bonds, which I've held and increased as cash equivalents, rising nominally and paying income, as illustrated in NFTRH each weekend. The inflation hysteria blew out in 2023.\n \n I do expect the 30-year Treasury yield \"Continuum\" (another of my indicators that has a nickname) to find support prior to the next phase of inflation. But first, a deflationary liquidity episode despite or maybe because of the man throwing wrenches all over the place. Later will come the next inflation phase, and it will likely be of the Stag variety. In other words, economically corrosive.\n Above is the state of the Continuum, which I expect to decline as the Fed weakens and the macro contracts over the coming months. Take note of the red trend lines that had so well resisted the yield for decades. It was busted in 2022 and has now turned up. A decline in the 30-year yield to approximately that level (roughly the 3.5% area) could be all she wrote for the deflation play before the next and more painful inflationary phase engages.\n Gold mining stocks are counter-cyclical. A counter-cyclical backdrop was indicated to be engaging last year, but the Biden administration's predictable fiscal operations kept the macro picture intact into the election. This was a major theme we carried all though 2024, right into November, after which the theme was that Trump would be left with an unwinding macro.\n I just did not know about how many spanners and monkeys he was planning to throw around to help it along. NFTRH is locked in on events that are in play because they are what we have anticipated and patiently awaited. You can trust me to call what I see, not what I want to see or worse, what you may want to see.\n Finally, I am able to call the macro in a favorable way for gold stocks. The going will be volatile, but we are in a new macro, one that is finally aligned for the gold stock sector."

Gold also set 20 new all-time highs, the most in any quarter since summer 1979's record count of 22.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But rather than selling more gold than they chose to buy, private investors as a group snapped 6 calendar quarters of profit-taking in gold to grow their combined holdings on BullionVault, albeit by only 86 kilograms (0.2%) to 44.2 tonnes.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Coupled with the precious metal's latest price jump, that took the value of BullionVault clients' gold investments – all securely stored and insured in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or most popular Zurich – to a new record of $4.4 billion (£3.4bn, €4.1bn, ¥663bn), higher from New Year's Eve by 19.5% (+15.9% in GBP, 15.1% in EUR, 14.0% in JPY).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Already the best-performing asset of the 21st Century to date, gold is surging as Trump 2.0 turns what was left of the US-led world order on its head. The \n            US President's tariff strategy and his increasingly volatile stance on Russia's war against Ukraine are proving the perfect chaos for new record gold prices, stronger even than the Covid catastrophe of five years ago.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The precious metal thrives on geopolitical uncertainty, economic stagflation and falling stock markets.

The index set a monthly low of 47.5 last March as gold crossed above $2100 per Troy ounce for the first time, \n            spurring record-heavy profit-taking among gold investors.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But with gold ending Monday almost $1000 higher, the Gold Investor Index read 54.6, exactly in line with its long-term average and down by 1.7 from February's leap to a 45-month high.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So while the pace of gold's gains is rightly making headlines, \n            the upturn in gold investment demand remains very measured to date. Gold's latest run of fresh record highs continues to attract new buyers. But rather than any kind of mania, gold is still recovering from last year's low demand and profit-taking. Its appeal, like the price, could yet have much further to run if Trump's policies tip the stock-market correction into a crash.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The number of new accounts opened to invest in physical precious metals on BullionVault last month slipped 4.0% from the near-4 year high seen in February. That still put it 40.5% above the prior 12-month average, led by strong growth in France, Italy, the UK and Germany.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Silver prices also rose sharply in Q1, increasing by 15.5% in US Dollar terms – the fastest quarterly gain since Q4 2022 – and setting new all-time highs for UK Pound and Euro investors on a quarterly-average basis.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But in contrast to gold, silver continued to meet net selling by private investors, with BullionVault users cutting their combined holdings by 13.8 tonnes since New Year (-1.2%) to the lowest by weight since December 2020 at 1,142 tonnes.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             By value, BullionVault clients' silver holdings rose 14.2% across Q1 to a new month-end record of $1.2 billion (£967m, €1.1bn, ¥187bn). But the Silver Investor Index, again tracking the number of buyers against sellers, halved February's 2.2 point rise in March, dropping back to 50.8 and putting the quarterly reading at 50.8.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Down 1.8 points from the end of 2024, that was still 1.4 points above last New Year's record quarterly low for the Silver Investor Index, and it marks a positive balance of buyers over sellers. But only just.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trump 2.0, in short, means so far that 'safe haven' beats industrially-useful. Because while gold is finding rising and strong new demand to buy, silver demand is much softer."

Because as long-time readers of Gold News or BullionVault's \n            Weekly Update emails know with a yawn, \n            gold has repeatedly risen when the stock market sinks.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So, how over-excited is gold in terms of productive business assets today?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             No doubt you've heard of \n            the Dow/Gold Ratio.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It aims to track the value of US corporate equities in terms of bullion. The ratio simply takes the current index level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and divides it by the current price of gold per Troy ounce.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The DJIA, however, is \n            a flawed index to say the least.

Gold got there in double-quick time. When it last crossed a 4-figure threshold, \n            gold took 2.5 years to finally stop falling back through it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But in the big sweep?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yes, fund managers and advisors who never tip gold are \n            suddenly paying attention. Yes, the metal is \n            making headline across the mainstream media. And yes, consumer demand is collapsing in the face of these new all-time highs, with \n            households across Asia choosing to sell and raise cash.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But those fund managers and advisors have barely begun allocating money to gold. The headlines come as Western investors remain flat net-net rather than rushing into a mania. And Asian demand – we think – is slowly transforming, edging away from bracelets and trinkets towards investment bullion as a store of wealth in the same way that Western household demand has been transformed so far this century.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             More on that in next week's \n            Weekly Update email to BullionVault users.

         "Title:A Bubble In Gold?\nArticle:Nope. Not by a long way...\n\n VIEWING the gold price in a vacuum, some may think there is a bubble in gold, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n The gold price is, after all, doing this...\n \n But a bubble in gold? No.\n Just last week the gold price ticked our target of $3000+, which was established in 2020 as gold topped out and began its Handle-making phase and pattern consolidation, after making a higher right side high to its massive and bullish Cup pattern.\n Is this round number target (it was actually the Cup's measurement) a stop sign? Maybe, for a while. Maybe not. Targets are objectives, not earth shattering conclusions, and bull markets do not go straight up.\n Aside from gold's nominal price, I have frequently presented this chart of the gold price relative to the S&P500. This shows who has really been the recipient of official (Fed and government) inflationary policies since 2011, and who has not.\n \n There is no bubble in gold, as compared to the SPX.\n But in looking through nftrh.com's extensive Links page, I reacquainted myself with Macrotrends, a helpful website that holds a lot of ratio charts of various markets. It's a nice visual nerd fest. Below is one that goes well with my assertion in the chart above.\n A bubble in gold? Hardly, as compared to the bubble in Monetary Base, which is a way of saying the bubble in monetary policy. I have been assigning the real bubble dynamics to monetary and fiscal policy, with the stock market simply being bubble beneficiary #1.\n Gold, on the other hand...Palookaville.\n \n A bubble in gold?\n Here is how Macrotrends describes the ratio.\n \n Aside from making my long-standing point that gold is not primarily about inflation (as they've chronically inflated money supplies for decades), the chart tells us that the current bull market in gold is only just getting started.\n My assertion is that the break in the Continuum's decades-long disinflationary downtrend (which gave license to ongoing and chronic inflationary policies by Fed and government) is indicative of policymaking that will be handcuffed relative to recent decades, in its ability to rescue asset markets in \"business as usual\" fashion.\n \n It is not hard to imagine that the nominal gold price could move significantly higher, even if the Gold/Monetary Base chart above gets nowhere near the 4.8 level noted by Macrotrends."

         "Title:How Hedge Fund Investing Exploded\nArticle:What began as a hedge became high risk...\n\n IT IS SAID that, in ancient Rome, triumphant generals returning home would parade around the city, writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.\n While crowds would gather – no doubt attracted by the prospect of bread and circuses – a slave stationed at his rear would whisper into the general's ear \"Memento Mori...Respice post te hominem te memento.\"\n In other words: \"Remember that you, too, will die. Look to the time after your death and remember that you're only a man.\"\n The medieval period is particularly rich in the memento mori in art. This correspondent has a (plastic) skull on his desk at home given at some fintech conference a few years ago for some reason. The point being, like that of the Roman slave, to remind us of our own mortality, and at the same time to remind us to make the most of the limited time we have on this earth.\n To resort to Latin for a second time: sic transit gloria mundi. How quickly the glory of the world passes away. Seize the day.\n Clients of the Tampa-based hedge fund OptionSellers.com were granted their own lesson in the transience of human affairs back in 2018, when the president of the company went onto YouTube to apologise for blowing the fund up after some ill-judged speculations in the oil and natural gas markets.\n We know neither James Cordier nor his former business, OptionSellers.com, so we can't tell whether his tears on the video are crocodilian or absolutely genuine. But we would make the following observations.\n The term 'hedge fund' used to mean something. It meant that high net worth investors sought a hedge against the inherent risk of traditional financial markets (ie, stocks and bonds) by diversifying into a form of investment vehicle that attempted to mitigate that risk. 'Hedge funds' did not start out as speculative investment vehicles, far from it. The original hedge funds were, as their name implies, looking to hedge risk, not to add to it.\n But as the hedge fund community grew in size, a seemingly endless number of greedy chancers jumped on board, attracted by the opportunity to charge clients both a 2% annual fee on assets under management and, typically, a 20% share of any positive performance on top. Just the 2% (the so-called \"carried interest\") would make any reasonably sized hedge fund manager rich, irrespective of their subsequent returns. The 20% performance share would, however, ensure riches beyond the dreams of avarice for the luckier high stakes gamblers out there.\n Volatility in the oil and natural gas markets is nothing new. What James Cordier refers to as the ship swamped by a rogue wave has happened on innumerable occasions before. See, for example, Amaranth.\n Amaranth Advisors, at its peak, was a hedge fund that had $9 billion under management. Although the fund had started out as a specialist in a strategy known as convertible arbitrage (which typically involves the purchase of convertible bonds and the simultaneous sale of related common stock), by 2005 the fund had shifted its focus onto energy trading and the natural gas market, influenced by its Canadian trader Brian Hunter.\n There's just one thing you need to know about the commodities market. It's volatile. Hunter speculated wildly in the natural gas market and ended up losing $6.5 billion.\n Long story short: hedge funds have morphed over the last 30 or so years from a relatively low risk way for wealthy private investors to diversify their portfolio risk into a Wild West of entirely unconstrained strategies ranging from conservative to ultra-aggressive, and in which the principle of 'hedging' and portfolio insurance has been cast to the winds. Given the 2% and 20% model that some hedge fund managers still use, you can hear the sound of the world's smallest violins playing just for them.\n There are no such things as 'rogue waves' in the financial markets. Or rather, if there are, then the traders blindsided by them have no fundamental understanding of the inherent wildness of markets.\n The requisite book for interested readers is Benoit Mandelbrot's The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets. The following extract is from our own book Investing Through The Looking Glass, which devotes almost an entire chapter to Mandelbrot. Investors – especially those engaging with the commodity markets – are strongly advised to consider the following of Mandelbrot's observations.\n Rule 1: Markets are riskier than we think. And certainly riskier than conventional financial theory thinks. Price movements do not happily track the bell curve. Extreme price swings are not the exception. They are the norm.\n Rule 2: Trouble runs in streaks. Or as Shakespeare put it, \"When sorrows come, they come not single spies / But in battalions!\" Market turbulence does not arise out of a clear blue sky and then disappear. It tends to cluster. A wild market open may well be followed by an equally desperate full trading session. A chaotic Monday may well be followed by an even more chaotic Tuesday.\n Rule 3: Markets have their own personality. The father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, famously created the manic depressive character Mr Market to account for the stock market's constant oscillations between greed and fear. But when individual investors, institutional fund managers, hedge funds, day traders and sovereign wealth funds come together in a real marketplace, a new kind of market personality emerges – both greater than, and different from, the sum of its constituent parts.\n Mandelbrot suggests that market prices are determined by endogenous effects specific to the inner workings of those markets, rather than by exogenous, external events. For example, his analysis of cotton prices during the last century showed the same broad pattern of price variability when prices were unregulated as they did in the 1930s when cotton prices were regulated as part of Roosevelt's New Deal.\n Rule 4: Markets mislead. In Mandelbrot's words, \"Patterns are the fool's gold of financial markets.\" The workings of random chance create patterns, and human beings are pattern recognition experts. We see patterns even where none exist and financial markets are especially prone to statistical mirages. Following from this, bubbles and crashes are inherent to financial markets and \"the inevitable consequence of the human need to find patterns in the patternless.\"\n Rule 5: Market time is relative. Just as the market has its own personality, so it has its own time signature. Professional traders often speak of a fast or slow market, depending on their assessment of volatility at the time in question.\n In a fast market, things like market-, stop- or limit orders have limited utility. Prices don't necessarily glide smoothly within narrow ranges. Sometimes they gap down or leap up, effortlessly vaulting beyond price limits presumed to protect portfolios from ruin.\n Traditional economists – if they've thought about the financial markets at all – have tended to treat them as a kind of closed system that obeys rigid and pre-set natural laws. Mandelbrot showed that the financial markets are altogether wilder than that. Another class of economists would recognise the inherent unpredictability of financial markets and the broader economy, and give them both the respect they deserved – the so-called Austrian School.\n Far from trying to maximise returns for our clients, we are trying to do something far subtler: participate as much as possible in the upside potential of the investment markets, while attempting to limit the downside as far as practicable. To this extent our investment objective is asymmetrical. We're not interested in simply tracking the market – if we assume, as it is for most people, that \"the market\" is essentially the market for common stocks. We're far more interested in absolute returns than market-relative ones. Unfortunately for all of us, most fund managers don't think that way.\n Don't allow exploded hedge fund managers to control the narrative. Only by understanding the risks inherent in investing (and in speculative trading) do we have a chance of navigating the squalls to come, and of our portfolios surviving them. A third of a century of working within the financial markets has convinced us that our greatest enemy is ourselves; more specifically, our genetically inherited 'fight or flight' response honed over hundreds of thousands of years has limited application in financial markets that mankind has only experienced over the last two centuries or so. Our brains have not yet had time to evolve to cope with the psychological trauma of market risk or of suddenly realised financial loss.\n At a time when many markets are struggling to find technical support, notably Big Tech stocks, and there are multiple political threats gathering on the horizon, it's worth bearing in mind that there are two component parts to equity investing. There's the underlying business which investors have fractional ownership of, and then there's the stock market, which will go wherever it wants. As equity investors, we should be most concerned by the underlying performance of the companies we own, not by the daily meanderings of the stock market. In the context of great 'value' opportunities, the only real purpose of the stock market is to create bargains for our consideration from time to time.\n Unfortunately, the underlying performance of most companies is only reported by the financial media on a quarterly basis, if that. But at the very least, it seems madness to be led by the daily gyrations of the stock market when it's the company's own profits and revenues and cash flow that actually dictate its market value over the medium term.\n Charlie Munger's famous quote about not caring when Berkshire Hathaway stock lost half its value is a typically hard-nosed articulation of this point. But he happened to be right. Equity investing can lead to terrific longer term wealth generation, but it requires a steely attitude and a willingness to buck the mood of the crowd. Not everybody has those characteristics. But then, not everybody is going to make money from their equity investments. The stock market has a tendency to shift money and profits from weak hands to strong ones.\n To paraphrase Charlie Munger, if you can't stand the heat, don't stay in the kitchen. But if you choose to leave the kitchen, chances are you will end up in the poorhouse."

         "Title:What are the main uses of gold\nArticle:What is gold most used for...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nIT’S OFTEN thought that gold’s value is arbitrary, or that it’s “just” decorative.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But there are good reasons behind the enduring use of gold in the financial system across thousands of years, and its endurance for just as long as a luxury material for jewelry.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Now, increasingly, gold’s properties of durability, malleability and conductivity are seeing the industrial uses of gold increase as new technologies develop; from aerospace to sustainable energy to computing to healthcare. Here are some of the main uses of this surprisingly versatile metal.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n\n\nSource: BullionVault via World Gold Council, LBMA\n\n\n               \n            \n Investment and finances\n\n\n               Gold has long been considered a cornerstone – and sometimes the “standard” - in investment and finance, mainly due to its scarcity, resilience and stability. No longer used as a literal currency, gold still provides a store of value and can be used as an investment to hedge against inflation and economic downturns. Investors particularly turn to gold during periods of economic instability, as it tends to preserve value more predictably than other asset classes. When inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, gold often retains its worth.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Central banks play a crucial role in this dynamic, maintaining substantial \n              gold reserves as part of their monetary policy. These reserves serve as a financial cushion and a source of liquidity in times of crisis. The presence of gold in the reserves can enhance trust and confidence in a country's economic stability. For an individual, the possession of vaulted bullion can provide similar confidence. Investment gold held by central banks takes the form of 400oz (12.4kg) bars with a minimum fineness of 99.5%.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Unlike stocks, which can be highly volatile, or bonds, which are susceptible to interest rate fluctuations, gold offers a tangible asset that is not directly tied to the performance of companies or governments. While stocks and bonds can yield higher returns in a bullish market, gold has continued to be a popular option for diversification, risk management, and long-term security and has been the \n              best performing asset so far this century.\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n\n\n\nSource: BullionVault via World Gold Council, LBMA\n\n\n               \n            \n Aerospace\n\n\n               Gold is an increasingly valuable resource in the aerospace industry, owing to its unique properties and versatility. One of its primary applications is in the creation of reliable electrical connectors and bonding wires, where the metal’s conductivity and resistance to corrosion ensure that electrical connections remain stable and effective under the harsh conditions of space, where other metals might degrade.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Gold is also used in coating aerospace components to enhance radiation shielding. In the vacuum of space, spacecraft are exposed to intense solar radiation, which can damage sensitive instruments. Gold's reflective properties help mitigate this by bouncing off harmful rays, protecting onboard equipment. The metal is also used in visors in astronauts’ helmets to provide UV protection.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               In thermal control systems, gold’s ability to reflect infra-red radiation is crucial in managing the temperature of spacecraft, allowing instruments to operate within their optimal ranges. This is particularly vital for missions involving satellites and space probes, which encounter extreme thermal variations. As more satellites are placed into orbit, the requirement for gold – as an indispensable element in the advancement of space technology - increases.\n             \n\n\n               \n            \n Electronics\n\n\n               Gold also plays a pivotal role in the production of electronic items. As with many other industrial uses of gold, the metal’s conductivity and reliability is key, allowing the seamless flow of electric current and ensuring efficiency in electronic circuit boards: the power behind the world’s laptops and smartphones.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Gold's resistance to corrosion makes it an ideal choice for manufacturing connectors, switches, and relay contacts. Unlike many other metals, gold does not oxidize, ensuring long-lasting and stable connections. This is essential for devices that require high precision and reliability, such as computers, smartphones, and medical equipment.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Gold is also used in the production of advanced microchips and semiconductors, where thin layers of gold plating are applied to silicon wafers to enhance the performance and longevity of the components.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               As gold does not corrode, it can be recycled from old devices to aid sustainability, estimates for the carbon footprint of recycling gold versus newly mined output vary from 1/20th to as low as 1/600th. Researchers have calculated that the cost of retrieving gold from used computer motherboards is 50 times lower than the value of the metal recovered. As technology continues to advance, the demand for gold in this sector is likely to remain strong.\n             \n\n\n               \n            \n Dentistry and medicine\n\n\n               Gold has been used within dentistry for centuries – the first ever printed book on dentistry, from 1530, provides advice on treating tooth decay, recommending cleaning the cavity and filling it with gold leaf. There is also evidence that gold wire was used to treat teeth in Ancient Egypt. By the early twentieth century, gold was the standard material used for dental fillings, implants and crowns.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Gold’s malleability allows dentists to precisely shape it to fit a patient's teeth. Despite the advent of newer materials, gold remains a preferred choice for many dental restorations due to the reliability and longevity resulting from its resistance to corrosion.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               In medicine, gold plays a crucial role in diagnostics and treatment. Gold nanoparticles are employed in various medical applications, including targeted drug delivery and imaging techniques. These nanoparticles can be engineered to bind to specific cells or tissues, allowing for precise treatment of conditions such as cancer. Additionally, gold is used in rheumatoid arthritis treatments, where compounds like sodium aurothiomalate are administered to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Gold also plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of biomedical sensors - monitoring physiological conditions, detecting diseases, and guiding medical treatments - due to its excellent conductivity and ability to form stable and reactive surfaces. These properties have led to its use in the booming wearables market, as well as in more specialized medical technology.\n             \n\n\n               \n            \n Jewelry\n\n\n               Gold has been revered for its beauty and rarity, making it a symbol of wealth and status across cultures and epochs. Ancient Egyptians crafted magnificent gold pieces for pharaohs, while Indian weddings often feature intricate gold jewelry, signifying prosperity and blessings. In Western cultures, gold has been associated with milestones such as weddings and anniversaries. Its appeal seems to transcend national boundaries, making gold a universal emblem of prestige.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               The purity of gold, measured in karats, significantly affects its value and wearability. Pure gold is 24 karats, but its softness makes it less practical for everyday jewelry. Consequently, gold is often alloyed with other metals to enhance durability and allow it to take different forms, shades and shapes. Commonly used alloys include 18-karat gold (75% pure) and 14-karat gold (58.5% pure). Higher karats indicate higher purity and value, but lower karats provide greater resilience and affordability.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               With growing awareness of environmental and social impacts, ethical sourcing has become crucial in gold jewelry production and other gold metal uses. Responsible practices include fair mining conditions, minimizing ecological footprints, and supporting local communities. Certifications like Fairtrade and the Responsible Jewelry Council ensure that gold is sourced sustainably and ethically, allowing consumers to make informed choices that align with their values.\n             \n\n\n               \n            \n Recognition\n\n\n               “Gold medal” and “going for gold” are synonymous with success, and gold has long been revered as a symbol of victory and prestige. Its shine, rarity and expense make it a coveted material for recognizing outstanding achievements. In sports, gold medals and trophies are awarded to winners, most famously at the \n              Olympics, where the metal clearly outranks silver and bronze on the winners’ podium.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Beyond sports, gold is widely used in military and civilian honours. Medals and badges crafted from gold are bestowed for acts of bravery, exceptional service, or notable contributions to society. These items serve as tangible reminders of their accomplishments and sacrifices, to be worn with pride and passed down through generations.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               Psychologically, \n              gold is associated as a reward with luxury, wealth, power, and excellence beyond the commonplace. The allure of gold as a symbol of achievement continues to inspire and reward those who excel in their endeavours.\n             \n\n\n               \n            \n Food and drink\n\n\n               Gold has no odour or flavour and is chemically inert. So, why is it increasingly an ingredient in food and drink? Edible gold leaf is used by some chefs to increase the visual appeal and prestige of gourmet dishes. Thin sheets of gold leaf now adorn chocolates, pastries, and even sushi, steaks and cheeseburgers. Gold-infused coffee, tea, and spirits are also increasingly popular, adding a touch of opulence to everyday indulgence – at a price.\n             \n\n                \n             \n\n               As gold is biologically inert and passes through the digestive system without being absorbed, it has no nutritional value, but does add a visually striking element to a dish. Gold-enhanced food and drink can provide a unique visual spectacle and caters to those seeking to indulge in a lavish treat. The use of gold as a marketing tool in high-end culinary experiences underscores its role in enhancing the perceived value and sophistication of products, and as more money is spent on luxury dining, the use of gold as an adornment has increased.\n             \n\n\n\n                \n             \n Future uses of gold\n\n\n                Technological advancements could allow for various future uses of gold, not all of them predictable. Gold nanoparticles are at the forefront of medical innovation, and are being explored for their potential in targeted drug delivery systems, where they can transport medication directly to cancer cells. Additionally, gold-enhanced nanotechnology is aiding in the development of advanced diagnostic tools that can detect diseases at an early stage, offering hope for more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.\n              \n\n                 \n              \n\n                Gold is emerging as a valuable component in the push towards sustainable energy, where nanoparticles are being integrated into fuel cells, increasing their efficiency and extending their lifespan. Similarly, gold is being used in the production of solar panels, enhancing electrical conductivity and overall performance.\n              \n\n                 \n              \n\n                The metal is also paving the way for breakthroughs in quantum computing. Its conductive properties make it an ideal material for qubits, the fundamental building blocks of quantum computers. Furthermore, gold's unique attributes are being harnessed in various futuristic technologies, including advanced sensors and communication devices.\n              \n\n                 \n              \n\n                Gold's future applications could extend far beyond its traditional roles, positioning it as a key material in medical, energy, and technology advancements. Its contributions are set to help shape the future, driving innovation and sustainability across multiple sectors.\n              \n\n\n\n               \n            \n Uses of gold FAQs\n\n\nWhat is gold used for in jewelry?\n\n\n\nGold has been used in jewelry for thousands of years primarily due to its appearance and natural lustre that doesn’t diminish over time due to gold’s inertness and resistance to tarnishing. Pure gold is relatively soft and easy to craft into delicate and intricate pieces and can also be combined or alloyed with different metals to change its colour and hardness.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is investment grade gold?\n\n\n\nThe global wholesale gold investment market, centred in London deals in the London Good Delivery gold bullion bar. This London Good Delivery bar weighs 400 troy ounces - about 12.4 kilograms - and is about eleven inches long. It is stamped on the top (the larger face) with the manufacturer's name, the weight, and the assayed purity. The minimum specified fineness must be 99.5% pure gold, but improvements in the refining process mean that Good Delivery bars now reach 99.99% purity or higher.\n\n\n\n\nIs gold jewelry subject to VAT?\n\n\n\nIn the UK gold jewelry is subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) at the standard rate of 20%. In the UK gold jewelry is considered a consumer good much like a mobile phone or TV. However, investment grade gold bullion in the form of London Good delivery bars or investment grade coins and small bars can be bought and sold free of VAT.\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of gold is used for investing?\n\n\n\nSince 2010 the percentage of gold used for investing has averaged 29%. 2013 saw the lowest investment percentage at 18% and in 2020 during the Covid pandemic the percentage of investment gold peaked at 49%. If you include Central Banks reserves as gold investment of sorts, then between 2022 and 2024 this reached 23% of gold demand.\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of gold is used for technology?\n\n\n\nBetween 2010 and 2024 the percentage of gold used in technology has averaged 8% with little variation over the past decade. In comparison over the past 15 years gold used in jewelry has accounted for 50% of total gold demand.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is gold used as an investment?\n\n\n\nGold is an enduringly popular investment for its ability to retain value over time and serve as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Analysts say that’s because physical gold doesn’t rely on anyone else’s financial survival or performance, getting you ‘off risk’ for credit, economic and stock-market volatility. Modern data says that gold prices have tended to do best when other assets did poorly, most especially the stock market.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the primary industrial uses of gold?\n\n\n\nWhile historically known for coinage, jewelry and investments (including bullion), gold is used in electronics, computing, aerospace, medicine, dentistry, glassmaking, and many other chemical and industrial processes. Gold has retained and even increased its usefulness through the application of gold nanoparticles in innovative technologies, including supporting renewable energy and in modern diagnostics.\n\n\n\n\nWhat properties of gold make it useful in industrial processes?\n\n\n\nGold has high electrical conductivity, excellent resistance to corrosion, high malleability and ductility, and chemical inertness. These properties make it ideal for usage in electrical components, the aerospace industry and in medical technology. Gold's malleability allows it to be drawn into thin wires and sheets, leading to its use in intricate applications. Gold's catalytic properties also make it valuable in chemical processes within fuel cells and automotive catalysts. Its biocompatibility ensures its safe use in medical devices and implants.\n\n\n\n\nIs gold used in any environmental applications?\n\n\n\nGold is being explored for use in environmental applications such as pollution control and clean energy solutions, due to its catalytic properties. Gold nanoparticles’ large surface area and ability to act as catalysts make them ideal for breaking down harmful substances, leading to use in catalytic converters and water purification systems. In environmental monitoring, sensors utilize the conductive properties of gold to detect changes in the environment, allowing for prompt action to mitigate pollution.\n\n\n\n\nWhat role will gold play in future technologies?\n\n\n\nGold nanoparticles are being used in cutting-edge medical technology and in sustainable energy innovations. Gold’s properties make it ideal for the manufacture of qubits, the building blocks of quantum computing. Advances in nanotechnology, materials science, and engineering continue to uncover new ways to harness gold's properties, and as the demands for clean energy, pollution control, and environmental monitoring grow, along with advances in wearables and space technology, gold's properties mean that the metal’s role is expected to expand – while maintaining its traditional uses as investment, decoration and store of wealth."

         "Title:Gold Up, Inflation Next\nArticle:Same thing, in truth...\n\n WHEN the price of gold rises – in other words, when more money is needed to buy an ounce of gold – that usually means that the Dollar's value has decreased, writes Nathan Lewis of New World Economics, quoting his 2022 book Inflation: What It Is, Why It's Bad, and How To Fix It in this article first published at Forbes.\n Daily price movements may not be significant. But, if the price goes up and stays there for an extended period, or if it fluctuates but the general trend is up, that signals a downturn in the value of the Dollar.\n When we first wrote this in 2022, it took about $1800 to buy an ounce of gold. Today, it is more like $2900. That implies an $1800/$2900 = 0.621 or a 38% decline in Dollar value over that period.\n Prices will eventually adjust, over a period of years, to the new, lower value of the currency, with some prices moving faster and some moving slower. \"All things being equal\" (they never are but it is a good principle), we should expect a $2900/$1800 or 61% rise in prices of goods and services going forward, compared even to the inflation-boosted prices that we have had to get used to in 2022-2024.\n Compared to prices in 2018, when it took about $1200 to buy an ounce of gold, we should expect a $2900/$1200 or 141% increase in nominal prices. Doesn't seem like much fun, does it.\n This is why we say \"you can't devalue yourself to prosperity.\" No country ever got rich with a weak currency. They get rich with a stable and reliable currency, which means: a currency of unchanging stable value.\n You would have to increase your nominal income by 141% just to break even. Maybe more than that, on an after-tax basis. Even if we do accomplish this, eventually, what it would mean is that we broke even, over a period of perhaps ten years. Instead of getting richer over ten years, we just made it back to flat. In other words, stagnation.\n This is basically why the Latin American countries never get anywhere. They are always just catching up to the chronic depreciation of their currencies.\n This might be confusing to some people, especially those with \"Monetarist\" leanings, and also those with \"Keynesian\" leanings – between them encompassing 90%+ of all formally-trained economists.\n The \"Monetarists\" are concerned with \"money supply\". They have a sort of narrative which goes like this:\n Expanding the money supply leads to more money chasing fewer goods, leading to rising prices. It is actually a pattern common throughout history, related to inflationary wartime finance. But, that has not been the common pattern since the Bretton Woods international gold standard era ended in 1971.\n Instead, what we tend to see is: A currency loses value, for whatever reason. Often, there is no particularly unusual \"expansion of the money supply\" going on, or any pressure from governments to somehow finance deficits with the printing press. It doesn't fit the Monetarist narrative at all – which is why they can't figure out what's going on.\n Later, as the economy reacts to this decline in currency value, nominal prices and nominal GDP tend to climb. Central banks typically \"accommodate\" this greater nominal GDP with a proportional increase in base money supply.\n During the 1970s, the whole world suffered from dramatic \"inflation\". The value of the Dollar fell from $35 per ounce during the 1960s, to around $350 per ounce during the 1980s and 1990s. It was a 10:1 or 90% decline in the value of the Dollar, compared to gold.\n Commodity prices, and prices for everything else too, verified that the decline in the Dollar vs. gold reflected a real decline in Dollar value. Oil rose from $3 a barrel in the 1960s to around $20 in the 1980s and 1990s.\n But, there was no particular \"expansion of the money supply\" going on during that whole decade. It wasn't much different than the gold standard era of the 1960s, or the disinflationary \"Great Moderation\" of the 1980s and 1990s. Government deficits were relatively small, and \"printing press finance\" was nowhere to be seen.\n During the 2000s, another major decline in the value of the Dollar vs. gold took place. From an average of about $350 per ounce during the 1990s, it fell to about $1200 in the 2012-2019 period – roughly a 4:1 decline. Commodity prices again soared higher, confirming that the Dollar's real value was indeed declining. A barrel of oil went from an average of about $20 in the 1990s to $60-$100 afterward.\n But, during this period, the base money supply grew at its lowest rate of the previous fifty years!\n I bring this up because we are again seeing the same pattern. The \"inflation\" of 2022-2024 was preceded by a gigantic increase in the base money supply of central banks, as a response to the Covid outbreak. This did amount to direct government financing, as governments ran gigantic deficits, issuing bonds that were effectively bought by central banks. It fit the Monetarist (or \"Austrian\") narrative well.\n But today, we are seeing another big decline in the Dollar's value vs. gold, with very little expansion – even some contraction – in central bank base money supply.\n This will again confuse the Monetarists and Austrians (they are easily confused), but we should recognize that this is actually a common pattern, just as we saw in the 1970s and 2000s.\n But, that's why we had to write a book about Inflation."

That matches the 1-month count of <gulp> Sept 2011.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But markets move opinions, of course, and bank analysts are now rushing to revise their 2025 gold price forecasts higher, if only from $3000 to $3100 for the more bullish forecasters.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The speed of gold's ascent means that private investors sound equally 'meh!' with the New Year forecast from BullionVault users now looking all-too doable at $3070. That seemed a much bigger stretch when we asked back at $2600.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Fast forward to mid-March and $3000 gold is just a heartbeat away (at pixel time). Which is right where the hot money wants it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Gold's hottest hot hotties love gold options, of course, because if they call it right, then each $1 staked a Comex bet can become many more. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The most active contract is now April. And can you guess what the single heaviest strike-price is by far for April Calls?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yep, $3000 per ounce. As of Thursday night, that bet accounted for 6.7% of all open Call options in Comex gold derivatives, followed by $3050 with 4.3% of open interest.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In fact, more than 2-in-5 April Calls are for strikes at $3000 or above. Whereas would-be sellers now holding Puts have staked less than half-a-percent of their Open Interest at $3k or above.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So what happens now that April gold futures have touched and moved up through $3000 per ounce? \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The hot money's biggest bet has paid off, and those happy-clever traders will no doubt want to close their Calls and bank their profit. And if the history of $1000 and $2000 gold gives any guide, the metal might then struggle to stay there, at least at first.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But does history apply here in 2025's Trumpian world?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yes, the 5 silliest words in finance always claim that \"Things are different this time\". But they really might be for gold right now.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             First, \n            gold has only just returned to favour among Western investors, rather than breaking $3000 amid an investing mania. Second, the crisis which investment cash is trying to protect against has barely begun.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trump uncertainty and fear mean that US stocks have so far lost only 10% from their record high of just 1 month ago. He's still got the best of 4 years in the White House. And on a 5-year horizon, as we never tire of repeating, \n            gold has always been higher when the S&P500 index has lost value. Well, very nearly.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Sure, things could be different this time. But if \n            the US trade war now raises the cost of living while hurting growth like everyone expects, then the resulting stagflation will provide the perfect backdrop for investing in gold.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Meantime, here's to $3000 gold and the furious re-writing of analyst forecasts it will provoke."

         "Title:Gold Mining Stocks Suck\nArticle:Gold +50% since 2011, miner stocks down 50%...\n\n THIS IS a response to an article on gold stocks I read, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n Be aware that the writer, at Gold-Eagle, does have 22 years of fact, of proof on his side.\n His argument is that gold stocks suck, to put it technically. Those 22 years of ignominy are not to be taken lightly.\n In his Gold Stocks: Fantasy vs. Reality, Kelsey Williams points out what all gold bugs know: How bloody terrible the miners have performed vs. their product.\n So this response is not criticism. It is, however, a response with more color than just the cold hard historical facts.\n Our all-everything chart shows the fact of the matter. I am not going to over-talk it. For that you can reference Friday's article on the subject. But the ratio between the HUI Gold Miners stock index and the price of gold itself has been Ignominy-Central since 2004 and, as I noted in my article, that is for good reason.\n Gold miners should have under-performed, given the macro we had. And they did.\n \n Now, I have no bone to pick with Mr.Williams, but his article appeared just after mine, which presented the potential of a view opposite his. So why not check his assumptions?\n He starts off noting the period I noted, as well. That was 2001-2004.\n \"Alas, that three-year period of super success for gold stocks compared to gold was followed by 22 years of declining performance, thus far.\n \"The current gold stocks-to-gold ratio is 0.11, just slightly above the 0.10 mark touched in 2024, and prior to that in 2015.\n \"The reality of the decline in the ratio from 0.60 down to 0.10 is exacerbated by the fact that not only are gold mining stocks underperforming gold bullion on a long term basis, they are net losers over the past 14 years, even in the face of a sharply higher gold price.\"\n Mr.Kelsey is giving us the history of it, which any committed gold bugs of that era know all too painfully well. What's more...\n \"Since the peaks for both gold and gold mining stocks in 2011, the gold price has increased by more than 50% ($1900 to $2900); whereas, gold stock prices have declined by 50%.\n \"As far as gold stocks being undervalued relative to gold bullion, well...of course they are. If they continue to underperform so drastically as has been seen, then how could they not be undervalued?\n \"Those who claim that gold stocks are undervalued mean that their prices have not gone up as much as expected, and, therefore, should increase substantially to make up for their failure to meet expectations. Good luck with that.\"\n Again, history and the talk of gold stock bugs crying \"value\" is similar to when silver bugs cry \"value!\" because simply the Silver/Gold ratio is so depressed, based on distant historicals. That is not the way to measure value, so Mr.Kelsey is correct there as well.\n 'Cheap' is a better word than 'value' in these cases.\n \"There are a host of reasons to not own or invest in gold stocks, except on a short-term, very speculative basis.\n \"They are underfunded operations (in most cases), subject to a host of external risk factors including labor strikes, shut downs, nationalization, etc. The biggest risk factor for most investors is the continuation of historical long-term underperformance, coupled with the risk of outperformance on the downside.\n \"The biggest declines in gold stocks come when gold and/or stocks in general fall precipitously. That has been shown clearly with gold stocks versus gold 1980-2000; and with gold stocks versus stocks in general (most recently in 2020 and 2022).\n \"Earlier this year, I included gold stocks on my list of five investments to avoid in 2025. The reason for that warning is that I believe the risks outweigh the potential rewards. I still do.\n \"If anything has changed, it is that the risks are greater now than at the time I wrote the article.\"\n Again, he is citing what has been. He cites facts. These are facts I have been aware of for many years. Gold stocks sucked for a majority of the 2004-2024 period.\n Where I take issue is that he extrapolates the 2001-2022 macro into the future. There are no macro-fundamentals mentioned. No major chances in the macro backdrop. No conditions like gold now strongly out-performing the cyclical macro since 2022.\n For most of the 2004-2024 period this was not the case and hence, gold stocks had leverage alright; negative leverage.\n \n However, I am not a robotic or automatic thinker. I am a rational and hype-averse thinker, but not set in stone with it. I am also a \"what if?\" thinker. As in, what if the blow out in the 30-year US Treasury yield \"Continuum\" which I have watched for years actually meant something as I thought it did at the time (2022) and still do?\n What if it meant an end to the era of inflationary Fed policy AKA business-as-usual, circa 2003-2022...?\n \n What if that, in combination with the 2001-2004 factors shown on my first chart above and in Friday's article 2001: A Historical Odyssey For Gold Stocks, we have a macro suited to that most unexpected of occurrences, an out-performance by gold mining stocks vs. their product, developing?\n If this happens it will have taken the investing world by surprise, as Mr.Kelsey's article implies. If it happens as I think it very well may, it could be for another short 3-year phase or something longer. I do agree that gold mining positions should always be trades rather than investments. But a trade can last days and great trade can last years.\n An interim caveat to my view would be if the broad markets tank bearish for real and the gold bugs flip and lead the tank-o-rama. That is another past fact as illustrated by Kelsey Williams. So there are risks. There are always risks in all investments.\n But risk vs. reward is a thing too, and I like the RvR in a sector that almost nobody thinks will ever perform and yet has ever more beneficial macro-fundamentals developing behind it.\n The bottom line is my response is written by someone who abhors those who week after week, year after year have written bullish things about gold stocks. They are what we call promoters. Cheerleaders.\n But I have presented facts of my own that lend color to the situation. Color that asks us to at least try not to be on autopilot where a potential big winner of a trade is concerned.\n I have shown reasons why it could well be different this time. Fundamental reasons. The HUI/Gold ratio has not yet gotten off the ground, but it is something I am watching for."

Up 0.4% from January's 4.5-year low, client gold holdings increased 1.1% to the 9th new all-time record of the past 12 months, rising above $4.0 billion for the first time.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             After falling below 50.0 in January to signal more sellers than buyers for the 5th time in 12 months, the Silver Investor Index rose 2.2 points to read 51.9 in February.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             By weight, however, BullionVault users were net sellers of silver, cutting their holdings as a group for the first time in 4 months and liquidating almost 5 tonnes as the more industrially-useful precious metal set new month-average records in UK Pounds and most other non-US currencies outside the Euro. That took total client holdings down 0.4% by weight to 1,151 tonnes worth $1.1bn (£915m, €1.1bn, ¥173bn).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Precious metals investing, in other words, currently favors the safe haven of gold over the industrial-growth story of silver. But while that matches the geopolitical and economic outlook as Trump 2.0 turns eight decades of Western military and trading alliances on their head, investor sentiment is positive towards both precious metals as they trade at new all-time record prices."

         "Title:So, About That Fort Knox Gold Thing\nArticle:No, Mr.Bond. I expect you to audit...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nSIXTY YEARS AGO, just as the fictional 007 was thwarting Auric Goldfinger's plan to empty Fort Knox and take America's gold to Soviet Moscow, the US Treasury feared a very genuine loss of its real gold reserves, writes Adrian Ash at BullionVault.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"My God, this is the time...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"If everyone wants gold we're all going to be ruined, because there is not enough gold to go around.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So said US President John F.Kennedy to then-chair of the Federal Reserve, William McChesney Martin in 1962.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The Cold War risked getting very hot amid the Cuban missile crisis, and gold's role as the ultimate asset of national power was being challenged by plutonium. But for monetary power, it remained the ultimate currency, and while America's giant hoard had already shrunk from its World War 2 peak, the mid-1960s saw almost one-half of all the gold ever mined sitting inside government vaults.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             What put it there? What kept it locked up?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             \"Fear, Mr.Bond, takes gold out of circulation and hoards it against the evil day.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"In a period of history when every tomorrow may be the evil day, it is fair to say that a fat proportion of the gold dug out of one corner of the earth is at once buried again in another corner.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So says Colonel Smithers of the Bank of England to double-oh!-seven in Ian Fleming's \n            Goldfinger (1959). The monetary facts were more prosaic, but the real-world crisis was no less dramatic.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Back in the third quarter of the 20th Century...back before \n            the 'end of history' marked the 'end of gold' for European central banks enjoying the victory of Western capitalism over Soviet communism...the almighty Dollar supported the world's entire monetary system under the Bretton Woods Agreement signed as the US-led Allies pushed towards Berlin in 1944.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Every other major currency was valued in terms of the greenback, and gold in turn backed the Dollar. Or rather, it backed 25% of the dollars in issue, as per the Federal Reserve Act.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So it was only by holding either gold or dollars (or better still, lots of both) that sovereign governments could hope to settle their international spending and debts with each other.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"Gold and currencies backed by gold [became] the foundation of our international credit,\" as Bond is briefed by Smithers in \n            Goldfinger.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"We can only tell what the true strength of the Pound is, and other countries can only tell it, by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Sitting atop this system...the \"Gold Exchange Standard\" as it's sometimes known...the US Dollar clung onto its position as the world's No.1 currency thanks to the sheer size of US national gold reserves. They'd risen three times over between the mid-1920s and the defeat of Japan 2 decades later, hitting more than 20,000 tonnes by the late 1940s.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             At its peak, America's nationalized gold reserve – the single greatest gold hoard on Earth – accounted for almost one-in-four-ounces ever mined in world history. But being the King makes it tough to sleep some nights, and for most of the Bretton Woods period, from the end of WWII until 1971, Washington tossed and turned.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Because if the US gold reserve fell, transferring real wealth overseas, it risked taking the Dollar's position as \"top dog\" along with it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"We now have $21 billion worth of refined uranium and plutonium,\" said a desperate Dwight Eisenhower at a meeting with his senior White House advisors on 9th November, 1960. \"This has great future value as a source of power,\" not least because it now topped the market-value of America's national gold holdings.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So \"could it be substituted for gold?\" the President asked, proposing a new bed-rock for US monetary reserves and, therefore, for the world.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Eisenhower's question – though bone-headed and \"politely dismissed\" as Francis Gavin relates in his excellent 2004 history, \n            Gold, Dollars & Power – was urgent. America's nuclear arsenal already supported its political power. Could plutonium sustain US monetary might as well?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Well...no. \"The great thing to remember about gold,\" as Colonel Smithers goes on in \n            Goldfinger, \"is that it's the most valuable and easily marketable commodity in the world.\" That still holds true today, six decades later.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Wholesale gold bullion – traded by professional dealers, refineries, bullion banks, central banks, and private investors choosing to use BullionVault – represents one of the world's deepest and most liquid capital markets.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             There is always a \"clearing price\" at which buyers and sellers will trade. Because gold's intrinsic value, the fact that it stores wealth in itself, rather than by deferring that value to some other asset, promise or production, is its only utility.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Industrial and medical uses barely count against the volume of gold held for its wealth-content alone. Whereas money backed by uranium, crude oil, plutonium or copper would be instantly trumped by their value as industrial assets – rare and valuable items, to be sure, but valued for their productive uses instead.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Back in November 1960, meantime, Secretary of State Christian Anderson had called that meeting at Eisenhower's White House meeting because the government-owned US gold reserve...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...fixed vs. the Dollar at an unchanging value of $35 per ounce since 1933...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...was about to slip below $18 billion \"for the first time in many, many years.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That was a lot of money in those days, but too little for comfort. Why?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             As the chart shows, the mid-1960s found \n            America's balance of trade tipping into a deficit.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It has rarely looked back. Because the USA still gets to pay the world in Dollars... \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...and those Dollars \"[are not] an impartial and international trade medium [but] in fact \n            a credit instrument reserved for one state only,\" as French President Charles de Gaulle spat in 1965.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So France (and Germany, among others) kept demanding gold rather than accepting US Dollars at face value and sitting on paper in payment. That was their right under the post-WWII Bretton Woods Agreement...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...a right exercised whenever the supply of dollars looked likely to force a revaluation of its gold backing...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...and a right finally lost when \n            Richard Nixon stopped redeeming dollars for gold in August 1971.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Nixon's decision to \n            float the entire world off gold and onto pure faith alone is often seen as a \"crime\", an affront to fair dealing and honest money which is \n            to blame for, well, everything you can think of. And Nixon certainly stuffed America's creditors, devaluing the Dollar by 100% compared with the promised ratio of $35 an ounce. Runaway inflation then followed as US dollars flooded the world, lacking any \"hard asset\" backing to limit their growth.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In less than a decade, the gold value of US dollars sank by 96%, pushing the gold price up to a peak of $850 per ounce. Gold has of course gone higher again since 1980, topping $2900 for the first time ever this month.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But in closing the \"gold window\" at the Federal Reserve – and thereby destroying the Bretton Woods exchange standard – Nixon was only completing a process begun before the First World War started in 1914.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yes, Tricky Dicky locked up America's gold reserve from foreign governments demanding hard assets in payment of debt. But more crucially in the great arc of monetary politics, Nixon also pushed US gold farther away from private circulation. Barring the US Treasury's late-1970s sales, in fact, he effectively made those reserves vanish from the face of the Earth.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"In the Ian Fleming novel,\" writes \n            Francis Gavin – then a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, now at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies – \"the sinister Goldfinger, ably assisted by Pussy Galore, plotted to steal the American gold supply from Fort Knox.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"The movie [of 1964] added an interesting twist to the book's improbable scenario...Goldfinger tells agent 007 that he does not have to remove the gold physically. Instead, he only needs to get inside Fort Knox and install a timed nuclear device supplied by the People's Republic of China.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"The bomb would irradiate all the gold inside the building and make it unusable...international liquidity would seize up, and the Western trade and monetary systems would collapse.\" It would also make the gold-mad Goldfinger's own personal stockpile of the stuff infinitely more valuable.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Luckily for the free world, James Bond and Pussy Galore team up at the end of the film to thwart Goldfinger's plan, de-arming the bomb and leaving America's national gold hoard intact.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But in reality, Richard Nixon achieved nothing less than Goldfinger's evil scheme in August 1971...and without the fruity charms of Pussy Galore as encouragement.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Nixon's decision to halt the outflow of nationalized US gold kept it both safe and secure from foreign powers, and also safe and secure from free circulation outside of government vaults. In effect it was irradiated, put beyond human reach and removed forever from the world's available stock of physical bullion.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So what if it's not there?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             As you might guess from the story so far, all the causes, issues and challenges around America's giant gold reserve aren't very simple.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But that doesn't mean the richest man in the world can't \n            reduce it all to a meme grabbed from TV cartoon South Park...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...hurr-hurr...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...nor that stopped-clock clowns can't reply with the \n            equally vacuous yet heart-sinkingly inevitable 2020s' riposte:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"Bitcoin fixes this.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Oh good grief.

But as a belt-and-braces process to confirm that your metal is where it should be, in full, it is vital.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Few competitors bother (especially those who claim to keep metal in their own store-room, rather than using independent specialists for custody to reduce the obvious risk of fraud). Hardly any gold-backed ETFs go to the trouble of having each and every bar checked either. Instead, they do only a 'sample' count and inspection. Which is what the US Treasury got for its Fort Knox holdings \n            last time they were checked too, back in 1974.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That sampling, of course, was because the USA's apparent gold holdings were (and are) massive, the biggest in the world, well over twice the size of (current, official) No.2 Germany. So a full count and inspection would take a very, very long time. But it might feel important if you want to push ahead and audit every branch of government in full. Most especially if you want all of those 8,133 tonnes of (reported) gold to be ready for sale...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...y'know, just in case the end of the world arrives...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...or more practically, in case you want to revalue the gold reserve to squeeze a few extra dollars out of the Treasury's arrangement with the Fed.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, the Federal Reserve \n            handed ownership of all its gold to the Department of the Treasury.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In exchange, the Treasury then issued certificates to the Fed for the value of the gold, which the Fed could then give to the Treasury in cash.

They're also significantly more optimistic about gold than BullionVault users, who were asked to forecast gold's price at the end of the year.\n           \n\n\n               \n            \n\n              Our December 2024 survey of 1,443 precious-metal investors (who say they typically hold 76% of their investable wealth in other assets) found that over 31% believed geopolitics such as the Middle East conflict or Russian/Ukraine war or US-China tensions would have the greatest impact on gold prices from January to the end of December 2025. Government spending and monetary policy were identified as the next biggest factors to impact the predicted gold price (20.8% and 16.8% respectively).\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Will that prove to be useful insight this year? Twice a year we \n             survey investors using BullionVault for their opinions on where precious metals prices will be at the end of the next December, plus what factors will have the biggest impact on those prices.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              For instance, in December 2023, when gold was trading at $2029 per Troy ounce, our survey respondents predicted that the price would reach $2342 twelve months later. That was a little conservative when you consider the gold price averaged $2644 for the month in December 2024 and Google’s Gemini gold prediction was a mere 0.4% out.\n            \n\n\n              \n           \n Gold price forecast FAQs:\n\n\nWill gold prices go up?\n\n\n\nPredicting the short-term price of gold is always a challenge, because many factors influence the price day to day, from geopolitical tensions to central bank interest rates, inflation, exchange rates and stock market performance.\nIn the short to medium term the price of gold rises and falls. However, if you look at the gold price over 10-year periods in USD or GBP, there is a clear direction to the chart and gold has been the best performing asset this century.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gold price forecast for the next 5 years?\n\n\n\nBecause so many factors influence the price of gold, predicting the next 5 years between 2025 and 2030 is difficult. Even professional bullion market analysts polled by the LBMA rarely get annual price movements right, let alone gold price predictions over 60 months.\nAmong the factors affecting a gold price projection, geopolitical tensions can create uncertainty, driving investors towards gold as a safe haven. Central bank interest rates impact the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, while inflation affects the purchasing power of currencies, potentially increasing gold's appeal as a store of value. Exchange rate movements impact gold's relative value across different currencies. Additionally, stock market performance often has an inverse relationship with gold prices, as investors may shift between equities and precious metals based on risk appetite. In 2024, for instance, global stock markets rose, with the S&P 500 rising 25% vs gold's 27% increase.\nThese diverse and dynamic variables shape gold's daily price movements, making short to medium term predictions challenging. Looking back 5 years to February 2020 in either USD or GBP, there were many periods when the gold price fell and then recovered, with a significant and sustained price increase running from New Year 2024 through to today. This illustrates how difficult it is to make gold price predictions over the short term.\nHowever, gold is by far the best-performing asset of the 21st Century to date.\n\n\n\n\nCan gold prices decline?\n\n\n\nGold prices can and will go down as well as up minute by minute. Longer term, if you look at a gold price chart for the past 5 years to 2025, there were periods when the general trend of the gold price was down as well, albeit with short-term spikes. That didn't reverse gold's underlying uptrend in value.\nConversely, within the same time frame, there were periods where the gold price was generally trending upwards yet there were still dips as the gold price dropped over several weeks or months before recovering.\nIdentifying dips when the gold price falls and spikes can provide opportunities to buy, sell and take profit from trading gold just as in any other investment market.\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n Silver price forecast for 2025: \n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT-4 Turbo\n $32 - $40\n $36 - $45\n $40 - $50\n $46 - $56\n\n\n Gemini\n $18 - $22\n $17 - $23\n $16 - $24\n $15 - $25\n\n\n Perplexity\n $31 - $33\n $31 - $33\n $32 - $34\n $32 - $34\n\n\n Meta AI\n $21 - $24\n $22 - $26\n $24 - $27\n $25 - $28\n\n\n Claude AI\n $30 - $33\n $31 - $34\n $32 - $36\n $33 - $37\n\n\n AI Ave. Forecast\n $26 - $30\n $27 - $31\n $28 - $33\n $30 - $36\n\n\n BullionVault users\n  \n  \n  \n $36.80\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $32.86\n\n\n Actual Ave. Silver Price\n $25.33\n $24.51*\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 12 May 2025.

Already the 3rd best performing asset so far this century, silver in contrast to gold finds more than half its demand from industry, where it is used in everything from photovoltaic solar panels to healthcare and electronics in every sector.\nGlobally, industrial demand for silver set a new record by weight in 2024, and forecasts see that demand remaining strong this year, helping support silver investing prices even amid short-term dips or drops in value.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the silver price forecast for the next 5 years?\n\n\n\nBecause silver has so many industrial uses today but also enjoys a long history as a monetary metal, the outlook for silver prices over the next 5 years will likely be tied to global economic growth as well as the performance of gold prices.\nIf the growth being forecast for solar energy, electric vehicles, electronics, military and other machinery proves correct over the next 5 years, then silver industrial demand is predicted to grow further, boosting the silver price.\n\n\n\n\nCan silver prices decline?\n\n\n\nDay-to-day, silver prices typically behave like gold but with greater volatility, both up and down. That can result in steeper losses of value for anyone investing in silver when the price drops, as looking at a silver price chart will confirm.\nLonger term, silver has underperformed the price of gold, perhaps because it doesn't enjoy the demand from central banks which has helped drive the 'safe haven' precious metal higher. But analysts agree that silver's fast-growing industrial demand should continue to support and boost silver prices.\nSilver's versatility and value to industry can't be overstated. 25 years ago the biggest use for silver was in photography, however since the incredible rise of digital cameras and mobile phones, the amount of silver used in the photographic industry has diminished by 90%. If there had not been replacement industrial uses for silver, such as in solar panels, it is logical to expect that the silver price would have fallen significantly in line with that key part of demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n Platinum price predictions \n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT-4 Turbo\n $975 - $1073\n $1005 - $1106\n $1036 - $1140\n $1067 - $1175\n\n\n Gemini\n $850 - $1000\n $800 - $1050\n $750 - $1100\n $750 - $1150\n\n\n Perplexity\n $920 - $980\n $940 - $1000\n $960 - $1020\n $980 - $1040\n\n\n Meta AI\n $900 - $1020\n $950 - $1080\n $1000 - $1140\n $1050 - $1200\n\n\n Claude AI\n $920 - $980\n $940 - $1020\n $960 - $1050\n $980 - $1080\n\n\n AI Ave. Forecast\n $913 - $1011\n $927 - $1061\n $941 - $1090\n $955 - $1129\n\n\n BullionVault users\n  \n  \n  \n $1037\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $1022\n\n\n Actual Ave. Platinum Price\n $969.18\n $969.02*\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 12 May 2025.

While Gemini is hedging its bets on where the platinum price will end 2025, the other AI models have far tighter low-to-high forecasts. Across all the Artificial Intelligence projects surveyed by BullionVault, the consensus forecast is that the platinum price will likely reach $1000 per ounce. \n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              BullionVault users concur and also predict the price of platinum will reach $1037 by year end.\n            \n\n\n              \n           \n Platinum price forecast FAQs:\n\n\nWill platinum prices go up?\n\n\n\nPlatinum prices have lagged gold and silver in recent years, going down harder and failing to go up as quickly. Only a low gain for the price of platinum is now forecast for 2025 by professional analysts. So platinum could offer a contrarian investment.\nDragging on platinum prices in recent years has been the rise of electric vehicles, because the precious metal finds its largest single use in diesel-engine autocats. Yet the actual level of platinum demand from the auto sector has not been going down. That means the drop in platinum mining output could support and boost prices in future, especially if the use of platinum in hydrogen fuel-cell technology continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the platinum price forecast for the next 5 years?\n\n\n\nA platinum price prediction for 2025 or beyond needs to consider how far new mining supply will fall behind industrial demand for the white precious metal, most of all in autos and hydrogen energy. That's because this deficit in platinum supply versus demand is what precious-metals insiders believe will stem its long-term underperformance and boost its underlying industrial and investment value.\n\n\n\n\nCan platinum prices decline?\n\n\n\nLike any asset or commodity, platinum changes in price minute to minute, going down or up no matter the underlying price trend. But with the cost of mining an ounce of platinum now so close to the bullion market price, it's worth considering how that could provide a floor to the value of platinum, helping support if not prevent a further decline in platinum prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n Palladium price predictions \n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT-4 Turbo\n $1028 - $1148\n $1057 - $1180\n $1087 - $1214\n $1117 - $1248\n\n\n Gemini\n $1500 - $1800\n $1400 - $1900\n $1300 - $2000\n $1200 - $2100\n\n\n Perplexity\n $920 - $980\n $940 - $1000\n $960 - $1020\n $980 - $1040\n\n\n Meta AI\n $1400 - $1600\n $1500 - $1700\n $1600 - $1800\n $1700 - $1900\n\n\n Claude AI\n $880 - $960\n $850 - $940\n $820 - $920\n $800 - $900\n\n\n AI Ave. Forecast\n $1146 - $1298\n $$1149 - $1344\n $$1153 - $1390\n $1159 - $1437\n\n\n BullionVault users\n  \n  \n  \n $1076\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $991\n\n\n Actual Ave. Palladium Price\n $961.28\n $954.64*\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 12 May 2025.

Or is there simply not enough data on the internet regarding palladium for Gemini to be confident about predicting a tighter price range?\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              That said Meta AI has clearly used a similar data source to Gemini to forecast the palladium price potentially hitting $1900, which is more than double Claude AI’s incredibly low prediction of ending the year at $900, less than the current Q1 price.\n            \n\n               \n            \n\n              Time will tell which of these AI predictions will be most accurate and how they will compare to the forecast originating from two human based sources.\n            \n\n\n              \n           \n\n Palladium price forecast FAQs:\n\n\nWill palladium prices go up?\n\n\n\nForecasts about whether the price of palladium will go up or down this year are tied to predictions for the level of demand for the precious metal relative to supply. The investing outlook tends to focus on how much palladium's price will be hurt or boosted by the balance of bullion coming into and going out of the market.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the palladium price forecast for the next 5 years?\n\n\n\nPalladium price forecasts have typically been too bullish in recent years, and the outlook from 2025 to 2030 remains uncertain. Analyst predictions point to 'over supply' in the market relative to demand, mostly for autocatalysts in gasoline engine vehicles.\n\n\n\n\nCan palladium prices decline?\n\n\n\nAfter falling for 2 years running, palladium prices stopped declining in 2024, albeit with the precious metal's lowest annual average price since 2017. Palladium could of course go down further from here, and investing sentiment remains very bearish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n 2024 precious metal prices versus 2025 forecasts\n\n\n\n\n Metal\n Dec-2024 average price (LBMA)\n 2024 average price (LBMA)\n BullionVault users' prediction for end 2024\n LBMA analysts' 2024 average forecast\n BullionVault users' prediction for end 2025\n LBMA analysts' 2025 average forecast\n\n\n\n\n Gold\n $2644\n $2386\n $2342\n $2059\n $3070\n $2737\n\n\n Silver\n $30.46\n $28.26\n $29.00\n $24.80\n $36.80\n $32.86\n\n\n Platinum\n $936\n $956\n $1010\n $1015\n $1037\n $1022\n\n\n Palladium\n $953\n $984\n $1130\n $1060\n $1076\n $991\n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             It is worth noting that these predictions from ChatGPT-4 Turbo, Gemini, Perplexity, Meta AI and Claude AI are based on the individual tool’s analysis of pre-existing market condition data and forecasts from other parties, they are certainly not set in stone.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Over 2025, we will revisit the predictions on a quarterly basis and measure them against the actual performance of the metals, offering insight into the abilities of these AI tools to forecast precious metal prices."

A separate memecoin issued by his wife, Melania, was worth $2 billion – not quite as valuable as $2.5 billion Fartcoin.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Referring to Trumpcoin, the technical analysts at Northstar made the following observation:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"Up 5,000% then down 50% in 36 hours. I'm really not sure about the wisdom or ethics of putting your name on a thing like this.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As one of our regular 'State of the Markets' podcasts, with Paul Rodriguez, we recently had the opportunity to discuss the state of the investment world with longstanding friend Tony Deden.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Our friend Ronnie Stoeferle of wealth managers Incrementum has been helpful enough to provide an abridged 'bullet point' summary of the conversation, which is published – with Incrementum's approval – below. A link to the original interview then follows.\n           \n\n Unconventional Start: Tony did not begin his career in traditional finance. He studied mathematics and chemistry, and worked as an acquisitions analyst. His entry into finance was driven by a desire to protect a family's capital.\n Learning Through Practice: Tony's knowledge of finance came from reading and practical application, not from formal financial training. He was motivated by a fear of poverty and doing something wrong, rather than by the pursuit of wealth and fame.\n Value Investing Influences: He was significantly influenced by the value investing approach. He also developed an early fascination with economic phenomena, seeking to understand money, interest rates, and how the world operates.\n Focus on Avoiding Errors: Tony emphasizes avoiding errors, rather than focusing on achieving big wins. He believes that understanding why companies fail is crucial. He views deploying capital like playing tennis, focusing on not making errors, rather than scoring goals.\n Human Element in Business: Tony believes the human element is the most significant factor in corporate failure. He prefers investing in mediocre companies with great people rather than great companies with mediocre people. He also looks for factors that contribute to a company's longevity. Critique of the Financial System.\n Markets as a Means: Tony sees financial markets as a means to an end, similar to a vegetable market for a chef. The market itself is not the goal, but rather a tool for finding quality at the right price. He is more interested in the real economy and those who produce goods.\n Rejection of Market-Driven Investment: He finds the investment industry too focused on outperforming markets and satisfying the wishes of those they serve. He thinks the practice is rooted in the needs and expectations of clients and the motivations of those serving them. Tony believes that comparing oneself in terms of money is problematic because people's aims and means differ.\n Critique of Financial Metrics: Tony is critical of measuring everything with money, especially since the nature of money itself is not fully understood. He believes the financial industry uses money as a tool without understanding its true nature. He argues that financial accounts were originally intended for accountability, not valuation.\n Money as Debt: Tony views the current financial system as problematic because money is essentially debt. He also finds inflation a difficult concept even for economists, and believes that the rise in asset prices is similar to the rise in prices of goods.\n Misallocation of Capital: He is concerned that money going to the stock market doesn't necessarily lead to more production or wealth. He believes that the focus on stakeholder capitalism has damaged society, money, and savings.\n Impact of Low Interest Rates: Low interest rates create a culture of speculation, forcing people to seek returns in the stock market, which he sees as a poor measure of economic health. Investment Approach.\n Focus on Companies and People: Tony focuses on understanding companies and the people behind them. He is not interested in simply watching markets rise and fall.\n Key Considerations: He considers three main questions when evaluating a business: Do I understand the business? Do I like the business? What is the motivation of the people behind it?\n Importance of Understanding: He emphasizes understanding the business, its risks, customers, and relevance. He avoids businesses that rely too much on external forces, such as airlines or banks.\n People and Motivation: Tony seeks to understand the motivation of the people behind a business, asking if they own the business with their own capital or through options. He also looks at whether they are in it for the long term and whether they focus on the factory floor or on Wall Street.\n Valuation After Understanding: Tony believes in assessing a business thoroughly before looking at financial accounts. The value is subjective and financial metrics can be misleading.\n Subjective Value: Tony emphasizes that value is subjective and interpreting value in one's own context has helped many make progress.\n Rejection of Formulas: He is against making mathematical formulas out of the notion of value. Economic and Societal Concerns.\n Challenging Environment: Tony views the current environment as very challenging for business owners due to the destruction of money and savings.\n Consequences of Mismanagement: He warns of the consequences of governments inflating away debt and printing money.\n Culture of Consumption: He believes that society has become a culture of consumption, rather than production, and we are eating the seed for tomorrow.\n Universal Disintegration: He sees a universal disintegration in the Western world, and thinks the vast bulk of people are being impoverished. The middle class has been destroyed in the Western world.\n Decline in Birth Rates: He notes the decline in birth rates in advanced economies, as it has become too expensive to start a family.\n Destruction of Money: He suggests that the destruction of money has led to the destruction of society. He points out that, in the past, families could be supported by one income, but that saving is no longer prioritized.\n Need for Failure: Tony believes failure is necessary to bring about a rejuvenation in ideas.\n Loss of Trust: He highlights a loss of trust in institutions, governments, and corporations. Tony believes trust is essential for progress in society.\n Rejection of State Monopoly: Tony believes that money should be independent of the state and have its own substance. He also doubts there will be a reduction in the size of government in the West. Other insights:\n Capital Allocation: Tony highlights the importance of capital allocation decisions for business owners, mentioning that they have to choose between investing in new equipment, hiring more people, or other options.\n Gold: Tony owns gold not as an investment, but because he sees it as having independent value and scarcity.\n Independence, Scarcity and Permanence: The three key characteristics of a successful investment.\n Investment Practice vs. Business: He emphasizes that his work is a practice, not a business. Tony distinguishes between an investment practice, which seeks to do the right thing, and an investment business, which seeks to satisfy the customer.\n Selectivity: Tony says that when selecting people to participate with them, they are very picky, looking for people who share the same values, have earned their wealth, and have a long-term time preference.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             You can listen to the \n            full conversation here. We hope and trust that readers will find it useful."

But it's still 40% below that all-time high right now.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             What's more, demand from central banks...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...a key turnaround in gold's fortunes since Millennium Eve...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...can't explain silver's strong 21st Century to date, as Matt Turner of Anglo American noted at \n            the LBMA seminar on this topic I chaired in December. Because no central bank buys silver as a reserve asset today.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Maybe that explains the performance gap between gold and \n            silver prices?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Or maybe central banks did help silver, as Matt suggested, because their gold demand helped drive up silver prices by association.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Either way, \n            the Gold/Silver Ratio has risen, suggesting that investors and consumers since the start of 2000 have sought safety of the yellow metal, driving its premium higher.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Reaching 86 as 2024 drew to a close, the price of gold in terms of silver ended the 20th Century at 54, having already risen from its start-1900s level of 35.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The underlying direction has been higher as well, with the Gold/Silver Ratio averaging 68 over the past 25 years after reading 57 on average between 1975 and 1999.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But if silver's investment and monetary appeal has looked dull if not tarnished next to gold, its strong and ever-growing tech stories are increasingly important, said Suki Cooper of Standard Chartered at \n            Christmas 2024's LBMA seminar.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             From \n            PV to EVs, defense to AI, silver's industrial demand hit yet another record in 2024, and it looks strong for the next 25 years, too.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Contrast that with 25 years ago. Back then, photography was the single biggest use of silver. And that industry's silver demand set an all-time record in 1999.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But from there, photographic demand halved by 2007...it was then overtaken by solar-energy in 2011...and it's now down 90% by weight, tumbling to a barely noticed also-ran among silver's big technological uses.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Which brings us to the platinum group metals, and the \"death\" of the internal combustion engine.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Both platinum and palladium continue to find their largest single use in autocats for reducing harmful emissions from fossil-fuel engines.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Burning fossil fuels is bad for pretty much everything except oil and gas company profits (and the tax they generate).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So the world has decided that internal combustion engines must go the way of the horse-drawn carriage and vanish from new car showrooms by 2030. Or maybe 2035.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Okay, call it 2050. Or failing that, 2060 at the very latest. Or \n            beyond that, so long as you offset all the carbon, okay?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As it is, the death of the ICE remains \n            a Mark Twain joke more than a fact, because people keep making and buying those vehicles. That means they keep needing autocats too, and those \n            autocats have needed ever-more platinum group metal so far this century, as the chart above from Johnson Matthey shows.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yet while \n            platinum prices have gained 106% so far since New Year's Eve 1999, the white metal peaked way back in 2007 above $2200 before slipping and sliding back to around $900 as 2025 began.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Palladium did exactly the same, but with a very different path. Also starting the new century at $440 per ounce, it rose 105% across the first 25 years of the new millennium in Dollar terms. Yet palladium didn't peaking until 2022, some 15 years later than platinum, and it topped way higher at $3400 per Troy ounce, only to drop back to the $900 level at the end of last year, again returning to match its sister metal's price once more.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So while the net outcome for Pt and Pd was the same, almost down to the dollar, their paths were strikingly different from each other and also from silver or gold, too. Yet the fact remains that, for ICEs at least, platinum and palladium may have an important lesson for silver:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\nThe PGMs are irreplaceable in autocatalysts.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Nothing else does the job so well. And thrifting by scientists trying to reduce the quantity used has hit rock-bottom, actually going into reverse, as higher environmental standards demand higher PGM loadings.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Now \n            think about silver in solar panels. Lots of people in labcoats are busy trying to reduce if not expel silver from that green-energy technology. But again, to date, silver hasn't been replaced, and thrifting has ground to a halt for now...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...also going into reverse overall, as more efficient new cells are developed...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...and driving total photo-voltaic demand for the former monetary metal \n            up to fresh record highs.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As for the PGMs, the cure for low prices might prove to be low prices, because...among scientists at least...research into new uses becomes much more likely when the stuff doesn't cost record-high prices.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Not the most bullish path forwards to 2050 perhaps, especially not with that 'net zero' deadline sitting somewhere around 25 years in the future and palladium really, really needing to find alternative uses as the death of the ICE maybe becomes a reality at last. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Little wonder then that sentiment, right now, is so undoubtedly weak. You know, like it was for gold back at New Year's Eve 1999."

         "Title:Why the Arctic Matters\nArticle:Vast resources spur geopolitical scramble...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nTHIS investment story is unfolding far from Wall Street, \n            writes Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             I recently spoke with Jonathan Roth, founder of ResourceWars.com and a veteran of capital markets. He highlighted an increasingly urgent issue: the Arctic.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As polar ice caps melt, new opportunities – and risks – are emerging in this increasingly contested region. Nations like the US, Russia and China are jockeying for influence, not only to access the Arctic's vast natural resources but also to secure strategic military and trading advantages.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Greenland, in particular, is shaping up to be a geopolitical hotspot, and it's no wonder that Trump has repeated his interest in acquiring the island.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             During our conversation, Jonathan emphasized the Arctic's immense resource wealth. The region is home to some of the world's largest untapped reserves of natural resources.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             A 2008 study by the US Geological Survey says that the Arctic holds 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and other fuels – equivalent to Russia's entire oil reserves and three times those of the US.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, is rich in critical minerals essential for modern technologies, including rare earth metals, graphite, niobium and titanium. These materials are vital for everything from smartphones to EVs to military hardware.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Ice loss in the Danish territory has also exposed significant deposits of lithium, hafnium, uranium and gold. A 2023 survey by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland evaluated 38 raw materials on the island, most of which have high or moderate potential.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Jonathan also pointed out that Russia has been quietly building its Arctic presence for over a decade. It now has the most significant military presence in the region, with refurbished Soviet-era bases and a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In 2024, some 38 million metric tons of cargo were shipped through Russia's Northern Sea Route (NSR), a record amount for a single year and a nearly tenfold increase from a decade earlier. The NSR is central to President Vladimir Putin's vision of a shipping lane that rivals the Suez and Panama Canal, but challenges like shallow, ice-filled waters and foggy conditions mean the route has a long way to go before becoming a global sea lane.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n             Annual Income of Cargo Transformation Through the NRS in Russia\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The country's Arctic ambitions are about more than just trade. The region is a cornerstone of its strategy to secure military and economic power.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This poses a significant concern for the US and its allies, especially as climate change accelerates ice melt and opens up new access routes. Russia's dominance in the Arctic could disrupt global trade, heighten geopolitical tensions and undermine US strategic interests.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             While Russia boasts dozens of icebreakers, including nuclear-powered vessels, the US is woefully behind. Jonathan highlighted that the last heavy polar icebreaker built by the US, the Polar Star, was commissioned nearly 50 years ago, in 1976. Meanwhile, the newer Polar Security Cutter (PSC) class of icebreakers, intended to bolster US capabilities, has faced years of delays and budget overruns.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n             Number of Major Icebreakers and Ice-Capable Patrol Ships, by Country\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Recognizing this, the US has partnered with Canada and Finland under the ICE Pact to develop a new generation of icebreakers. Finland, which designs 80% of the world's icebreakers, brings valuable expertise to the table.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Greenland's importance extends beyond its resource wealth. Jonathan noted the island occupies a key position along two potential Arctic shipping routes – the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route. As sea ice continues to melt, these routes could significantly reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the Suez and Panama Canals.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Greenland is also home to Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule Air Base), a critical US military installation for missile early warning and space surveillance. The base's strategic value is compounded by Greenland's role in the so-called GIUK Gap (Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom) – a naval chokepoint in the North Atlantic.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Investment in Pituffik has been inconsistent, however, and its importance has waned since the Cold War. Renewed attention to Greenland could help the US counter Russia's growing Arctic dominance and China's ambitions as a \"near-Arctic\" power.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The Arctic's significance isn't just about resources or shipping lanes. It's about power, influence and the ability to shape the future of global trade and security.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             For investors, the region offers opportunities in sectors like energy, mining and infrastructure. Companies involved in rare earth mining, icebreaker construction and Arctic logistics could see significant growth as nations ramp up their Arctic investments.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             As always, investors should keep a close eye on these developments. The Arctic may be cold, but the race for its riches is heating up."

         "Title:Get Gold or Hang\nArticle:Worked for America with Stable Money...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nTODAY we are seeing a lot of the institutions and bad ideas of the Post World War II Consensus breaking down and collapsing, \n            writes Nathan Lewis of New World Economics in this article first published at Forbes.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Among these is the rather stupid notion that economies should be managed by some combination of currency and interest rate manipulation, and \"fiscal stimulus\" spending that amounts to utter waste, for the simple reason that it has no justification except as \"stimulus\". \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             These are the conclusions of \"Keynesianism\", which has been taught in all universities since the 1940s.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Note how this is completely opposed to what I've called the Magic Formula of Low Taxes and Stable Money. This is the Formula that enabled the United States to become the wealthiest country in the world, and the same Formula that enabled Japan or China to achieve similar results more recently.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             If the US sadly deviates from this Formula today, nevertheless taxes are Lower, and the currency is more Stable, in the US than in most any other developed country today.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n             Value of $1000 in gold ounces\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             We see that it takes more and more Dollars to buy an ounce of gold; and also, more and more Euros or Yen.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This is probably a reflection of a declining value of the Dollar, Euro and Yen themselves, rather than any change in gold.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The average price of a hamburger in New York City in 1950 was $0.10. Today, it is a lot more than that – and still rising, at a rate that is quite unpleasant to anyone who gets hungry in Manhattan.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Is there some shortage of hamburgers? Or maybe too many people have a job? (Economists keep telling us that the solution to \"inflation\" is more unemployment.) No, the reason that hamburgers cost a lot more now is because the Dollar lost value during that time – somewhat like the Turkish Lira has also lost value over the past 20 years, producing terrible chronic inflation in Turkey. Not as bad, but basically the same thing.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Already certain measures of \"inflation\" are ticking up, and already economists are getting ready to tell us again that too many people are going to work and making a living. This is stupid – which is why we had to write a book about \"Inflation\". (Get the new paperback edition, with a new preface.)\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This is not how we used to do things. For most of United States history, we embraced the principle of Stable Money – money that is stable in value. This was exemplified by one of the first Acts of the new Congress, the Coinage Act of 1792. In that Act, it said:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"SEC. 19. And be it further enacted, That if any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said Mint shall be debased or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less weight or value...every such officer or person who shall commit any or either of the said offences, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             If you messed with the value of the Dollar, expressed in terms of gold and silver, you got hanged.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But today, the value of the Dollar goes up and down every day, and mostly down in the longer term. Various representatives of the Federal Reserve bloviate in public about how it is not really their fault.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The original principle of 1792, Stable Money, actually became a cornerstone of US policy for the next 179 years – until the Gold Standard was effectively ended on August 15, 1971. The United States, just like all decent countries had done for centuries previous, maintained a stable value for their currency by fixing its value to gold and silver, and then, by 1900, to gold alone.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In practice, there have always been only two alternatives for currencies: have some kind of floating currency, or fix its value to some external benchmark. Today, more than half of all countries fix the value of their currencies to an external benchmark, most commonly the Dollar or Euro. Sometimes they are not as successful in this as we would like (their central bankers are as dumb as ours), but nevertheless, that is their policy.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This works for smaller countries, but obviously the United States is not going to fix the value of the Dollar to the Euro or the Mexican peso. The only \"external benchmark\" of practical use is gold – just as an assembly of nations memorably decided at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Jim Grant, one of our best financial historians, has called this \"the Gold Standard and the PhD standard.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The United States did not always stick to its Stable Money principles. There was a major episode of floating-currency disorder during the Civil War, and a number of other more minor incidents. But, as long as the United States stuck to the principle of keeping the value of the currency Stable, there was never a problem with \"inflation\".\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             They made it all the way to 1950, with a hamburger that still cost $0.10 – probably not much different than in 1850.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             I think that Americans will get tired, pretty soon, of ever-increasing prices accompanied by ever-increasing blame-avoidance by the economic high priests of the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But simply being dissatisfied doesn't amount to much. You need a solution. There is only one solution that has always worked: fixing the value of a currency to gold.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Our noble forefathers consented to hang anyone who messed with the currency. Maybe we don't have to go that far today, but it is a nice idea don't you think?"

         "Title:Trump's Fresh Gold Price Records Extend Profit-Taking by Investors\nArticle:But gold investing draws new buyers too...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nNEW YEAR 2025 is bringing a wave of new investing into physical gold, \n            writes Adrian Ash at world-leading marketplace BullionVault.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             But existing owners across Western markets continue to trim their holdings, taking profit as a group as the 'safe haven' asset hits \n            fresh all-time gold highs on Donald Trump's return to the White House.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             BullionVault gained more than twice the number of first-time users this January than it did 12 months before. But overall, its customers ended the month owning a little less gold for the 16th month in the past 17.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The price of gold continued to rise much faster than investors sold. That raised the value of client gold investment – all securely vaulted and insured in each customer's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich – by 7.4% to a new record near $4.0 billion (up 8.6% to £3.2bn, 7.9% to €3.8bn, 5.9% to ¥615bn).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This extends the pattern of 2024, when \n            record-heavy profit taking by BullionVault users still left their vaulted gold holdings dramatically higher by value. Trump's trade tariffs are just the latest crisis to spur fresh record highs in gold investing prices.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Indeed, the precious metal has doubled or more for Western investors \n            since the pandemic began five years ago.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yet rather than rushing for the exits above $2800 per ounce...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...or £2250 or €2700 or even ¥14,000 per gram...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...rich-world investors as a group continue to take only a little profit net-net from gold.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That leaves the bulk of their gold allocation rising in value as a hedge against the new risks and volatility which 2025 has already brought.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Using BullionVault's low-cost and award-winning platform, the number of investors choosing to start or add to their personal holdings of securely stored gold bullion edged 3.7% higher last month from December's figure.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But the number of sellers leapt by 61.5%, hitting a 3-month high with the fastest jump since March.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Together that knocked \n            the Gold Investor Index down 1.6 points to 52.7, the lowest reading since September and 2.4 points below the near-18 month high hit amid Trump's clean sweep of November's US elections.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Tracking the number of buyers versus sellers on BullionVault each month since 2009, the Gold Investor Index set a decade peak at 65.9 as the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020. It then set a series low at 47.5 in March last year, signalling more sellers than buyers for only the 3rd time ever with a reading below 50. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Helping stem the index's drop was further strength in the number of first-time buyers. January 2025 saw the count of people opening a BullionVault account to buy securely stored and insured gold, silver, platinum or palladium more than double from 2024's exceptionally weak start (up 117.4%). And compared to the 2024 month-average, new account openings ran 40.8% ahead worldwide, led by a rise of 56.0% in the UK compared to the prior 12 months, 64.3% in Germany, and 66.9% in the Netherlands.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             France eased back, in contrast, slipping 11.9% from last year's average monthly pace as its political crisis took a pause between Prime Minister Barnier's resignation and the forthcoming austerity budget.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The USA remained quiet as Donald Trump retook the White House following November's decisive election win, with the number of first-time US bullion buyers dropping 20.9% versus 2024's monthly average to the fewest since June.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Silver holdings on BullionVault meanwhile ended January unchanged from December's 3-month high by weight, rising 7.3% by Dollar value to the highest since October above $1.1bn (up 8.9% to £947m, 8.0% to €1.1bn, 5.7% to ¥181bn) as silver prices also jumped like gold, albeit to only 7-week highs at the end of last month.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Investors as a group chose to sell silver, with sellers outnumbering buyers across the month and pulling the Silver Investor Index down by 3.0 points to 49.7, its 5th sub-50 reading of the past 12 months.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The spectre of profit-taking, in short, continues to stalk the surging price of precious metals. But those prices continue to rise much faster than investors are choosing to sell."

         "Title:How the Everything Bubble Ends\nArticle:Economic inflation and falling yields fade...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nPROPERLY defining the current Macro will, by extension, help us properly set strategies for 2025 and beyond, \n            writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             It takes a lot of deep and ongoing work, not guessing or bias-promoting. We do this work in order to end up right on the big swings when the time is right, and to be right along the way in the interim. Charting and stock picking are fun, but only after the real work is done.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Let's take a look at the 30-year Treasury bond yield Continuum from another angle by way of a chart I just found in my list that we used back in those critical days of early 2020 in gauging the coming inflationary recovery (and future inflation problem). I've marked it up further today in an effort to tell a story.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             My general view of this story is that what people call the \"Everything bubble\" is actually a long-term bubble in monetary policymaking. You can always count on government from either side of the aisle to auto-stimulate through fiscal policies. It has been periodically interrupted by bubble bursts, liquidity events and inflationary recoveries as our policy heroes swing into action. This continuum of invasive policy is ongoing, but in 2022, after the latest and most extreme policy kick-save ever, the bond market rebelled, and today the trend is gone. Poof!\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Now we are left to try to define what comes next after the end of an incredibly consistent and definable trend ended for this macro view.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Alan Greenspan kicked off the age of Inflation onDemand back in the relatively innocent days of 2001-2004.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This represented the start of a multi-decade phase of ever more intense, chronic and intrusive monetary policy in response to any and all market liquidity crises. Ole' Greenie laid the groundwork and Bernanke put it on steroids.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Aside from the obvious effects of this policy (halting bear markets, resuscitating the economy, manufacturing inflation) the very acts of printing money and spending from an ever-growing bag of debt has created the ongoing and intensifying disparity between the haves (asset owners, who've seen their assets chronically rise due to inflation) and have-nots, who are not part of the investment class and whose paychecks have not nearly kept up with the macro parlor trick known as inflation, which has been inflicted upon society as a matter of...POLICY!\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Among other things, this dynamic – in my strong opinion – created the environment in which most recently the old party was thrown out and the Trump party was given its mandates. I will guess that in 4 years, after the coming inflation and/or economic bust, the reverse may happen.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             With the Continuum of long-term yields having busted its trend to the upside the setup is for Trump/Powell 2 to be more intense and rancorous than Trump/Powell 1, which was pretty damn rancorous (recall Trump's robo-tweeting, berating the Fed chief for not dropping the Funds Rate, despite the Continuum's then in-progress rise to the red EMA trend limiters). We noted at the time that Powell's Fed was going to do the bond market's bidding, not Trump's.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Powell held his ground until the economy and inflation signals began to ease, when he began cutting rates, a regime that ended with a deflation scare and inflationary response for the ages, in Q1 2020, compliments of that jerk called the Corona Virus.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Today the bond market is different. Captain Obvious wants you to know that. And it is not different in a pro-Trump way. If anything, Powell will – barring a complete capitulation to the will of the orange man – doggedly respect bond market signals.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Hence, an economic downturn and market liquidation is almost necessary if markets and the economy are to continue with a semblance of \"business as usual\".\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             However, Trump 2 is presenting as a force of nature compared to Trump 1. If this is all presentation and bluster with no real force behind him, Trump will probably have to sit back and eat the Fed's decision to independently manage markets monetary policy-wise. However, Trump has a thing in his pocket called fiscal (ie, governmental, political) stimulative policy, along with a mandate to use it however he, and the houses of Congress he puppeteers, see fit.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In other words, the Fed could be marginalized in this scenario, leaving our economic fate to a real estate developer used to getting what he wants and used to using credit/debt to get it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It is shaping up as an epic struggle (in my opinion) between the bond market (and by extension, the Fed) and government. Most administrations, including Trump 1, eventually wilt before the great and power Fed of Oz. But Trump 2? Is he bluster or is he a force of nature? Real or Memorex?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             These are questions we need to take seriously, anticipate correctly and therefore, strategize by. 2025 may not be as simple as a contrarian bear play, although that is still my favored view. Von Mises wants us to know that there is another option as well.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             For those who want straight technical analysis and straight answers, please pardon my detour above. But it is how I operate. I cannot in good conscience just issue prognostications without doing and showing the work behind it. The summary of the above is that I have not yet decided for myself which way I firmly believe the 2025 macro will go.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             I have a favored plan (hat tip once again to the most reliable contrary indicator on the planet, carnival barker extraordinaire, Contrarian Investing With Jim Cramer). But we must be looking at as many viable possibilities as we can so that we do not operate in a vacuum of bias. I will be right or I will be wrong about the anticipated nearer-term contrarian market liquidation plan, that would come after a perhaps final drive upward in markets.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The alternative is an inflationary \"crack up\" that becomes ever more intense, with an absolute bull (in a China shop) at the helm of the economy. In that event, things could appear bullish for longer, but also capital would be in flight, probably aiming for real assets relative to paper (stocks, currency, etc). It's a world of increasingly divisive geopolitics and a big time \"grab\" for these things could be in play.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Maybe a fitting and climactic end to the age of Inflation onDemand, after all."

Or India.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             I mean, over the past 25 years of gold investing, how could you? Least of all when \n            New Year's Day in China just saw \n            gold prices in India hit new all-time highs?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Ask any analyst or gold investor and they'll tell you:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Demand from the citizens of gold's giant Asian consumer nations has grown over the past quarter century.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But see how it mirrored private demand from the G7 economies of Europe, the USA and Japan? Who knew that?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Time was, some pundits called the world's 2 most populous nations 'Chindia'.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The term was coined in the early 2000s by Indian politician and columnist Jairam Ramesh. He \n            urged China and India to cooperate, rather than compete, to accelerate their inevitable re-emergence as world-leading economies after 3 centuries of Western dominance.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Ten years later, Ramesh called his idea of \n            Chindia \"still vibrant\". By then, it had also become a topic of policy and intellectual debate for Chinese and Western academics and policymakers, plus a much blunter target for US marketing gurus and 'how to' books to help you exploit these new \"megamarkets\".\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Chindia has since become a romcom movie (set in the USA), and last year it was \n            used against Ramesh himself in a row over New Delhi kowtowing to Beijing!\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But 2 decades ago, this chimera also proved useful to Western investment analysts, especially in precious metals. Because while \n            India had long been the No.1 gold consumer nation, China was catching up fast.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             See where China's private gold demand overtook India?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             See how that's where it stopped tracking the Dollar gold price, too? It leapt most dramatically when Chinese households and investors seized on \n            the gold price crash of 2013...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...coincidentally the last time that Chinese horoscopes celebrated the Year of the Snake.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Let's park that for today. Because for gold so far this century, the word Chindia meant something important which didn't need nuance or understanding, so long as it kept buying gold.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Which it did. Most of all when the West did not.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             By weight, private-sector gold demand in the G7 rich-world economies grew or fell together with demand from Chindia in only 11 of the past 32 years, barely 1/3rd of the time.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Across the first half of that period (shown in our first chart above) that figure read 50%, but it sank below 19% in the second half. And last year, 2024, was the first time in almost a decade that gold demand among households and investors in both Chindia and the G7 grew together. (Or so our guesstimates reckon today.)\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Taken apart, in contrast, China and India show strong co-movement in their private gold demand. Their purchases have grown or fallen together by weight in 16 of the past 25 years (64% of the time) with barely a break between 1998 and 2007 or 2013 to 2022.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             By weight, however, China's private-sector gold demand has outrun India every year since the big price crash of 2013. Or so the best available data say.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             On that, please note:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n Demand for jewellery isn't counted the same way as demand for coins, bars or gold ETFs. Trinket purchases are gross of reselling (ie, scrap) whereas the 'investment' category is net;\n There isn't any freely available or reliable recycling data for jewellery, not country-by-country. So like the World Gold Council (who publish the data now gathered and crunched by specialists Metals Focus we're using above), our charts and analysis lump gross jewellery in with net investment. Sorry;\n All private-sector gold demand in China ultimately starts on the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the only legal route for bullion to enter private circulation. But India's government has no such pinch-point (or stranglehold) and cross-border smuggling makes the true size of private-sector demand ultimately unknowable. Indeed, smuggling explains how gold prices inside India have consistently run below the global price plus India's import duty and GST sales tax;\n Maybe more importantly, these figures don't include private-sector demand for vaulted gold bullion either. That has almost certainly leapt in China during its real estate, stock market and bank interest rate slump (now entering its 4th year). But it doesn't show up anywhere in hard data; indeed, the gold sitting on commercial bank balance sheets has actually shrunk, most likely because China's financial slump means investors now want to own allocated bullion (such as you buy and sell on BullionVault) rather than holding a mere promise which underwrites the bank, not the investor's portfolio;\n On top of all this, the numbers and charts above do not include central bank demand. Partly that's because we're focusing on private-sector demand, and partly because the 'true' figures for the People's Bank are contested and unknowable. Very possibly, they account for some of the gap between heavy imports and visible demand.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             That said, so might China's commercial bank holdings, allocated to 'gold accounts' for Chinese investors. And central bank buying might not make much difference to the big picture anyway.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Remember, the idea of Chindia was simple, meaning stupid and blunt.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It matched the early 2000s' 'commodity supercycle' or 'BRICS' marketing spin spun out by Goldman Sachs, and it enjoyed the same impetus too. Because oil prices, cheap exports and gold prices were all driven higher...or so the story goes...by the sudden switch to runaway capitalism by formerly communist/socialist Chindia.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That switch saw over a billion people released from poverty. One of the first things they chose to buy with their new disposable income is gold. Or so the story goes.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yet as our chart above shows, the proportion of Chindia's soaring economic output which was spent on physical gold actually fell into the 21st Century...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...before recovering its early 1990s' levels as the Western banking sector's \"global\" financial crisis saw gold prices surge...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...only to drop back again across the past decade or so.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yes, the value of cash spent on gold by China and India has jumped since the turn of the Millennium. But it hasn't grown as fast as their GDP. Across the past 33 years, in fact, the first two 11-year stretches saw Chindia spent 0.68% of their joint economic output on gold, but that has fallen to 0.51% across the past 11 years.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Bottom line? China and India have played a huge part in \n            gold's success as the 21st Century's No.1 asset class so far. But they could've been bigger. And odds are, long term, that they will be...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...whether or not the proportion of income and wealth they spend on gold rises...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...as Chindia's GDP continues to grow both in cash terms and relative to the early 21st Century's rich-world economies."

         "Title:Truth and Investing\nArticle:Price matters, even when distorted...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nTRUTH, said the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, is tough, \n            writes Tim Price of Price Value Partners.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             \"It will not break, like a bubble, at a touch; nay, you may kick it about all day like a football, and it will be round and full at evening.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In a quote attributed to Mark Twain, if you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything. So the only real question remains: for investors, can there be more than one truth?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             We're not sure there can be. There are clearly various styles of investing, just as each and every one of us has a different personality, needs, objectives, and fears. But fundamentally, we think most of us are probably after more or less the same thing:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Decent, inflation-beating returns, probably allied with some form of income, and without incurring too much downside risk and notably the risk of ruin.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             To any value investor, the one fundamental truth is the price. The market price of any traded security is dictated every day between willing adults, buyer and seller. But there is no compulsion to accept that price. If we don't like the price on a given day or hour, we can always wait for a better one, or look for something else.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It cannot be said too often: the most important characteristic of any investment you make, be it property, stocks, bonds or anything else, is the price you pay when you first buy it. Overpay, and you are likely to regret it. Buy it cheaply, and you will likely do well.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The French scientist Blaise Pascal once suggested that all of humanity's problems stem for our inability to sit quietly in a room alone. He was more right than he could possibly have known – especially in a world of digital connectivity, smartphones, the wireless internet, and 24/7 social media.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The problem for the 21st century investor is no different to the problem for the 17th century physicist: too many distractions, almost all of them triggered by our own essential curiosity and inability to sit still.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Which is why we now find ourselves increasingly drawn to the Stoics. We don't remember being taught anything about them at school. We suspect we first came across them during The Silence of the Lambs when Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) alludes to Marcus Aurelius:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature?\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The Stoic approach to life can be summed up in Reinhold Niebuhr's Serenity Prayer, which has been adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\"\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             There is much utility and wisdom in that short phrase – for investors as for everybody else.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             After 35 years of working in the capital markets, the principles of investing seem, if anything, to get simpler by the day. The most important drivers of return in portfolio construction are asset allocation and then security selection.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Asset allocation is \"simply\" finding the optimal (or perhaps satisficing) mix of different types of investment types to ensure you have a sensibly diversified portfolio. It makes sense to own assets that aren't correlated to each other, and yet which all offer the potential – based, in almost all cases, on the truth of price – for decent returns over the medium and longer term.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             For us, those asset types are 'value' stocks; systematic trend-following funds; and real assets, notably assets related to the monetary metals, gold and silver.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Except as a source of liquidity, both cash and bonds no longer feature materially in our portfolios given their comparatively low yields relative to their credit risks, and our expectations of an uncomfortable inflationary future not experienced since the 1970s.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The one common thread that links everything within the portfolio is that we want them to be at least somewhat resistant to a market crash. In the case of the equity component, while we can't immunise everything against \"crash risk\", we can at least ensure we don't consciously overpay for investments, and we can also try to ensure that they possess what Ben Graham famously described as a \"margin of safety\" that will, to some extent, possibly insulate them against grievous market falls.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             And don't expect all of these types of assets to work all of the time, because life's not like that, and neither are the financial markets.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trend-followers, for example, made pretty heavy weather of things during the years of ZIRP. But that wasn't a huge concern, to the extent that their \"crash-proofing\" credentials weren't realistically required when equity markets essentially delivered the goods.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Security selection, again, should be driven primarily by the truth of price. In the world of listed equities, for example, we favour companies run by principled, shareholder-friendly managers who are also expert at allocating their own corporate capital (ie, deciding whether it is best spent on corporate acquisitions, or on stock buybacks, or on dividends), and where the shares of those companies are not obviously trading at any great premium to their inherent net or book value.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But the emotional and psychological challenges stay with us. Inasmuch as the politics and economics of our time influence the investment debate, you could plausibly argue today that the challenges are more extreme than they have been for several generations. The Covid crisis alone has lifted up a giant rock in the middle of our political and media culture, and we doubt whether anyone anywhere much likes what has been revealed scuttling around underneath it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The re-election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of Elon Musk as a social media icon, have sent twin unconventional wrecking balls into the world of both domestic and international political protocol. The global financial crisis (now almost two decades ago, though we live with its aftermath still) has ushered in wholly unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing (QE), zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and negative interest rate policy (NIRP) which many of us found wholly morally questionable but nevertheless massively distorting upon asset prices.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Which is where the Stoics come in. If we're frankly unable to change the things that concern us (the woke mind virus; the economic insanity of 'net zero'; foreign wars) then it makes more sense to concentrate on the things that we can change – which is not just our investment choices and our investment strategy, but also how we choose to respond to those external world events.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In many cases, as the likes of Rolf Dobelli have suggested, the best response to those things, particularly those things brought to us by the news media, is simply to ignore them – or, even better, never even to be troubled by them in the first place. The essayist and trader Nassim Taleb claims never to read newspapers or to watch news, on the basis that if anything truly important is going on, he'll always find out about it through friends, say, at a drinks party.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Drawing on extraordinary investing facts highlighted by the US market analyst Michael Batnick a few years ago:\n           \n\n The less you look, the better off you'll be. Tracking your portfolio returns in real time will be injurious to your mental health.\n When you were born trumps just about everything else in the significance not just of your investing experience but your investing outlook as well.\n Cash flows are better than commodities. (But own both. And own real assets anyway.)\n The stock market is not the same as the economy.\n You can calculate everything yet still not know how investors are going to feel. In other words, focus solely on the truth of price, and let other people worry about the \"macro\".\n And we strongly recommend buying a copy of Ryan Holiday's The Daily Stoic.\n\n\n             These are dark times, and being able to draw on tried and tested psychological sustenance is an absolute godsend."

         "Title:Commodity Market Returns: Update\nArticle:2024 review for copper, gold, silver...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nAT THE START of every year, we publish our popular Periodic Table of Commodity Returns, \n            says Frank Holmes at US Global Investors.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             This interactive graphic details the gains and losses across the commodities market. Gold stood out as a bright spot in 2024, delivering one of its best annual performances in over a decade, while industrial and agricultural commodities faced significant challenges.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Up an eye-popping 27.2% last year, gold's performance made clear its enduring role as a safe haven. Central banks continue their aggressive purchases, seeking diversification in an increasingly uncertain global economy. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures and a growing US deficit further boosted the appeal of the yellow metal, helping it outpace the S&P500 in 2024.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             On a year-over-year basis, the average annual price of gold has now advanced 84% of the time this century, notching 21 positive years out of the past 25 years. For the second straight year in 2024, gold was the best performing commodity. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n             Average Annual Gold Price Has Advanced 84% of the time this century\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Silver also posted strong gains in 2024, climbing 21.7%. I believe the metal's outlook for 2025 is even brighter.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Industrial demand for silver, fueled by its critical role in solar panels and electrification, is expected to set new records. Its dual demand as both a precious and industrial metal places silver in a position to outperform gold in the year ahead.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But the global manufacturing sector, a bellwether for commodity demand, ended 2024 on a weak note. The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI dipped further into contraction territory in December, falling below its three-month moving average and signaling declining output and new orders.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This weakening trend points to a sluggish start for 2025, raising concerns about the demand for key industrial commodities such as copper, aluminum and nickel.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             China, the world's largest consumer of metals, was an unexpected bright spot as its manufacturing sector showed modest expansion. However, the broader outlook remains cautious, with business sentiment reaching a three-month low.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Commodities tied to clean energy and electrification showed resilience in 2024, despite the global manufacturing slowdown and President Donald Trump's roll back of \"green\" agenda items. Copper and aluminum posted gains of 2.2% and 7.7%, respectively, supported by demand from renewable energy projects, electric vehicles (EVs) and grid modernization efforts. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) reported robust growth in clean energy deployment last year, with solar installations up 35% and energy storage installations surging by 76%.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Meeting the exponential demand for metals critical to the energy transition will require significant investment in exploration and production. Ernst & Young (EY) projects that achieving global net-zero goals will necessitate 41 million metric tons of copper annually by 2050, a massive target given the lack of substantial new mining projects.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             According to S&P Global, only 14 new copper deposits were discovered between 2014 and 2023; that's significantly lower than the 75 new discoveries that were made between 2004 and 2013.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n             Major copper discoveries have declined over the years\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             While energy transition metals show promise, other commodities faced sharp declines in 2024. Natural gas prices plunged nearly 71%, weighed down by mild weather in Europe. Agricultural commodities also struggled, with wheat and corn falling 40.9% and 28.8%, respectively.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, saw a significant drop of 21.8%, reflecting temporary oversupply and slowing demand growth in China. And the outlook for 2025 presents several headwinds for commodities.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trump's plans to expand fossil fuel production and eliminate EV mandates may slow progress on the energy transition. Proposed tariffs on China and other trading partners could further disrupt global trade, potentially reducing demand for industrial and energy commodities. Wood Mackenzie warns that these protectionist measures could shave 50 basis points off global GDP growth, with significant implications for oil and gas consumption.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Interest rate policy adds another layer of complexity. While the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in 2025, the pace of easing may fall short of market expectations. Higher rates for longer could weigh on economic activity and dampen demand for raw materials.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Despite the challenges, long-term opportunities remain abundant. Gold and silver are likely to retain their appeal as hedges against uncertainty, while metals like copper and nickel stand to benefit from ongoing investment in electrification and clean energy infrastructure. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The Periodic Table of Commodity Returns highlights the cyclical nature of markets and the importance of staying informed. As 2025 unfolds, investors can position themselves to weather the challenges ahead and seize opportunities in the next phase of the global economy."

         "Title:Tech Bubble Bursting, 1920s Edition\nArticle:Happened then, ready now...?\n\n IN THE 1920s Radio Corporation of America (RCA) was the hottest stock in the world, writes Jim Rickards at The Daily Reckoning.\n Radio was cutting-edge tech, and RCA was dominant in the sector. The company was the largest manufacturer of radio sets and operated the largest broadcasting company, NBC. They owned key patents and had attracted many of the country's best engineers.\n In 1921 RCA shares traded as low as $1.50 (split-adjusted). By 1929 RCA rose to a peak of $549. A 352x return.\n At its highs in 1929 RCA was trading at a P/E of 72x. Speculation had driven the price far beyond rational levels.\n The bubble popped in 1929, and by 1932 RCA shares were trading at $15. That's still a 10x return over 11 years, but the majority of investors had bought in at much higher prices. The use of margin borrowing was commonplace, and added fuel to the fire (sound familiar?).\n Of course, we also saw a similar mania during the dot-com bubble. Cisco, Intel, and a few other tech leaders soared to unimaginable heights, then crashed back down to Earth.\n You could say RCA was the Cisco of the Roaring '20s. And possibly the Nvidia of its time.\n Is DeepSeek the pin today?\n China's new AI model DeepSeek R1 has the potential to be the pin that pricks the AI bubble. But it hasn't happened yet.\n On Monday, Jan. 27, Nvidia shares fell 17% after the market had digested China's AI developments. Shares then rebounded by almost 9% before losing half that rally on Wednesday.\n I don't know if this Chinese AI model will be the catalyst that ends the AI mania. But the bubble will inevitably end.\n The market is poised for a crash, it only requires the right catalyst. Something frightening. A bank run, financial crisis, war, or even an AI breakthrough from our primary competitor.\n Whether this latest Chinese AI model is that catalyst remains to be seen. But the 17% one-day drop in Nvidia shares does demonstrate that this market is easily spooked.\n The rise of AI in America has severely concentrated market risk. Even before the AI boom, markets were already heavily tilted towards big tech.\n Today it's far more pronounced. Anyone investing in the S&P 500 has more money in the Mag 7 stocks than they do in the bottom 400 companies put together. These 7 big tech firms make up about 34% of the entire S&P 500.\n This is what happens during bubbles. A handful of companies dominate the market.\n Make no mistake, these periods are driven by real advances. But they inevitably get out of control. It has happened with every major technological development. Railroads, internet, crypto, and now AI.\n Anyone who has studied manias can clearly recognize the signs. Problem is, it's difficult to know exactly when it will end. But judging by the market's recent action, we're getting closer.\n If you own almost any American stock market index, you likely have plenty of exposure to Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and the rest of the Magnificent 7.\n Now is not a time to jump into these names as the tech sector remains vulnerable. I much prefer to buy areas the rest of the market is ignoring. Gold, silver, miners, oil and gas, residential real estate. Hard assets.\n Despite all the hype around this tech cycle, we are still entering a hazardous monetary period. The US and much of the world have entered into debt spiral territory. Once debt/GDP broaches 120%, as it did recently in the US, it almost always leads to a debt or monetary crisis. Even in a best case it leads to a prolonged period of slow growth, which is also poison for stocks.\n AI is powerful, but it cannot save us from mathematics. So if you don't have any, go buy some hard assets. The easiest place to start is gold and silver. I suggest that everyone should have 10% of their portfolio in these assets. They remain the ultimate diversifiers."

         "Title:Operation Contain China, Status Failure\nArticle:Biden handed China the AI keys...\n\n AMERICAN A.I. companies are feeling the heat over the past month, writes Adam Sharp for Addison Wiggin's Daily Reckoning.\n China is catching up. In some areas, they are even surpassing the US in artificial intelligence. It may seem hard to believe, but it's true.\n Chinese companies DeepSeek and ByteDance recently released models which are on par with the best models from top US companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.\n Here's what legendary venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen had to say about DeepSeek's new R1 reasoning model:\n \"Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen - and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"\n This Chinese model is \"open source\" meaning anyone can freely use it in their own applications. And it costs 1/10th to 1/30th as much as the equivalent US models.\n Yes, that's right. China is now \"dumping\" cheap, high-quality AI access on the world, as they have similarly done with steel, cars, rare metals, and thousands of other products.\n On top of all this, these new models are about 95% cheaper to build compared with top American models.\n The implications are massive. In the long run, this could threaten not just American AI software companies, but also NVIDIA. If cutting-edge models can be trained with 5% of the previous hardware requirements, what does that mean for GPU sales going forward?\n How did we get here?\n Two words: Joe Biden.\n The damage his administration caused to American AI efforts will echo for the next decade. President Trump is already working to reverse the damage, but this will take time.\n The first thing the Biden admin did was attempt to strangle America's AI industry. Marc Andreessen has said that in a meeting on the AI industry, Biden officials told his venture capital firm the following:\n \"Don't fund AI startups. That's not something that we're gonna allow to happen...\n \"AI is going to be a game of 2 or 3 big companies working closely with the government...We're going to protect them from competition, control them, and dictate what they do.\"\n Biden (or his handlers) wanted an AI industry they could control completely. The admin issued AI \"safety\" executive orders designed to limit competition. Fortunately, Trump has already repealed these EOs, but they set us back for 2+ years.\n In a 2022 effort to contain China's AI advancement, Biden cut off the country's access to high-end NVIDIA GPUs, which are (were) the only suitable hardware to build and run AI applications with.\n These tech sanctions have backfired spectacularly. We cornered China and gave them only one way out: innovation. It appears they have met the challenge.\n They learned to build cutting-edge AI applications without high-end NVIDIA GPUs. As a result, they can now build models for a tiny fraction of the cost we do.\n Fortunately the bulk of their breakthroughs are \"open source\", meaning we can learn from and incorporate the designs into future work.\n But if we had simply let China have access to top NVIDIA chips, these breakthroughs probably wouldn't have happened for years. They wouldn't have needed to. And NVIDIA would have sold a LOT more chips. Now China has its own competing chips, and is making the most of its hardware by maximizing efficiency.\n Necessity breeds innovation, and Biden gave China all the necessity it needed. This proves, yet again, that sanctions on big developed countries almost always backfire.\n Now we find ourselves in a difficult spot. As I mentioned, Trump is already working to address these challenges, and I believe he will eventually find success.\n But we can no longer pretend that China is behind on AI. That era is over. The project to contain their development has failed. It's time to strike a deal with China, and I continue to believe it will be one of Trump's top priorities.\n In response to these Chinese breakthroughs, Trump is launching the $500B StarGate project with OpenAI, Oracle, Softbank, and others.\n Hopefully this project will take the lessons from Biden's China mistakes to heart. We need to be more efficient with our chips. We can no longer rely on brute force to dominate artificial intelligence.\n The wakeup call has arrived. We can no longer underestimate China's AI sector. American companies will have to step up, and release new cutting-edge products (even if they are unsure about issues like safety).\n Things are about to get very interesting."

         "Title:Cramer's Contrarian Trump Call\nArticle:Unwitting king of big calls strikes again...\n\n CONTRARIAN INVESTING is simple, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole.\n When the herd thinks one thing, you think the other. And there is no greater tender of the investing herd than Financial TV star Jim Cramer.\n His inverse record of correct market calls is amazingly accurate. This is not just me poking fun at a cartoon character on the TeeVee. It is me (and many others) having observed this man's record in action, over many years. He's got a TV show, after all. He's got to give his viewers what they want: red meat.\n Boo effing ya! \"Unbridling the Bull\" indeed.\n CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday told investors there will be a shift in Wall Street's focus, from the actions of the Federal Reserve to those of President Donald Trump.\n \"We're now looking at the changing of the guard from Powell to Trump,\" he said. \"It won't be easy, as one's a pretty predictable guy and the other's a wild card.\"\n Jim Cramer told \"investors\"...ah, Cramer told a particular herd that thinks it can tune in to a sensational TV show and gain something of value. \"Investors\"? Yes, I am sure that Dalio, Tudor Jones and Druck were riveted to their seats in rapt attention.\n What the clown prince of contrarian investing is actually saying – in terms that his audience can understand – is that governmental fiscal policy will largely replace Federal Reserve monetary policy. It's just that the word \"Trump\" is so dynamic, emotional and to some, exciting, that Cramer and the network he performs on will of course put it in those terms.\n \"It feels like we may be back in the world that I remember, a world where the Fed only plays a role at extreme moments,\" he said. \"A world where we don't have to guess and guess and guess their next move, or even listen to what the regional governors are saying, because it won't be that important in the margins.\"\n The above is actually a good point he's making. However, it is not as simple as that. In fact, the bullish implications of Trump are the basis of why a contrarian investing opportunity (an opportunity to go the opposite way of the herd and its predominant perceptions) is likely (IMO) in development, because Trump is so pro-business.\n The previous administration did all it could to pump the system to new heights of debt and mal-investment. Interest rates have lurched back upward on the back of that and the stated policies to come from the Trump administration. Oh and there's this...the Fed still matters. Oh yes it does. We'll see the degree to which it matters when Trump launches his first volley of verbal bombs at Jerome Powell.\n Here I disclaim that I too wish we lived in a world without a monetary central planning authority. But I am dealing in the world we have, not a Utopian world.\n Hearken back to late 2018 when long-term Treasury yields were busting upward to test the upper bound of our then resistance limits (monthly EMA 100 & 120, now supportive limits) on the Continuum (30yr Treasury yield) as Trump constantly hectored the Fed chief to drop the Fed Funds rate. Powell all but ignored him.\n \n If history (eg, 2018) repeats, the Fed will bow to its true master, the bond market. Not its new (would-be) master, Trump.\n Back in 2018 Trump messed up his timing, because he attacked Powell as yields were rising and the Fed was following bond market signals. After that came the decline (from the limiters) as was usual during the Continuum's decades of trending down.\n Today, the situation is much worse, from a bond market perspective. My view is and has been that no matter Trump's pro-business, pro-economy intentions, the macro is stressed to a coming reversal point. Maybe after a big time clean-out, Trump 2 will take hold to positive economic effect.\n In other words, there is no denying that deregulation, tax cuts and maybe even some aspects of tariffs would be positive for corporations. The stock market is made up of...corporations. But we are talking interim here. An interim where perceptions are unified in one direction after that direction has already been in play since the 2020 mini-crash. It is in play with a host of negative macro internal conditions and indications.\n Now the play is on a popular TV cartoon show. Just sayin'."

Because with gold racing higher early last year following that bullish price prediction, it got us thinking.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n             Like gold, global stock markets had also risen sharply in 2023 and hit new all-time highs in 2024, led by shares related to artificial intelligence such as Nvidia. So, what did some of the world's most popular AI tools (ChatGPT and Google's Gemini) think of gold and the wider bullion market this year?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             On 23 February 2024, we asked the two natural language processing tools to predict the prices of gold, silver, platinum and palladium over the next 4 calendar quarters. We could then compare those AI forecasts against the very human forecasts from BullionVault users, as well as from professional forecasters at bullion banks, brokerages and specialist consultancies.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Below, we've compiled the 2024 price predictions from those AI tools, BullionVault's investor community, professional gold market commentators, and the actual quarterly price outcomes.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Who proved to be the most accurate forecaster at the end of 2024: human investors, human experts, or AI machines?\n           \n\n             \n           \nHow accurate were AI precious metals price forecasts in 2024\n\n             In general, Google’s Gemini price forecasts for 2024 were closer to the actual 2024 quarterly average bullion prices than ChatGPT predictions. \n           \n\n             \n           \n\n             Across all 4 quarters Gemini’s price predictions were on average closer to reality for gold, platinum and palladium than ChatGPT. \n           \n\n             \n           \n\n             However, when predicting 2024 quarterly silver prices ChatGPT’s forecasts were slightly more accurate than Gemini’s. \n           \n\n             \n           \n\n             As you’ll see from the charts below, when trying to forecast palladium prices for 2024 ChatGPT clearly referenced incredibly bullish data and ended up predicting prices that ended up being more than double actual prices. \n           \n\n             \n           \n\n             See below more detailed commentary for each individual metal. \n           \n\n             \n           \n Gold price predictions\n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT\n $1,700 - $2,200\n $1,700 - $2,250\n $1,700 - $2,300\n $1,750 - $2,350\n\n\n Gemini\n $2,120 - $2,344\n $2,250 - $2,350\n $2,400 - $2,600\n $2,500 - $2,800\n\n\n BV users\n  \n  \n  \n $2,342\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $2,059\n\n\n Actual Ave. Gold Price\n $2,071.76\n $2,337.99\n $2,476.80\n $2,661.61\n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 2 January 2025.

This was closely followed by geopolitics and government spending (22.0% and 20.8% respectively).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Would that prove to be a useful insight? Twice a year we \n            survey investors who've chosen to use BullionVault for their opinions on where precious metals prices will trade on the next New Year's Eve. We also ask them what factors will have the biggest impact on those prices.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In December 2022, when gold was trading at $1800 per ounce, BullionVault's survey respondents predicted that the price would reach $2012 twelve months later. Not too bad when you consider the gold price averaged $2029 for the month last December.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The following Christmas we asked them to forecast where gold prices would then end 2024. This time, on average, they predicted $2342 per ounce, some 10% below the final price of the year but much closer than most professional analysts had guessed.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\nHow did AI gold price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?\n\n              Gemini's high and low quarterly average price predictions for gold in 2024 were far tighter than those for ChatGPT and when examining Gemini' s average quarterly price forecast compared to the actual prices, Gemini predictions only varied by 1.7% compared to the actual average quarterly gold price over the year. \n            \n\n              \n            \n\n              However, if you only look at the Gemini predictions for the last 3-quarters of 2024, the variance vs the actual average prices drop to 0.4%, indicating that Gemini's 2024 quarterly gold price forecast made back in February was quite accurate and certainly closer than the LBMA analysts' forecast or BullionVault's users predictions. \n            \n\n              \n            \n Silver price predictions \n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT\n $20 - $30\n $20 - $30\n $20 - $32\n $21 - $33\n\n\n Gemini\n $25 - $30\n $28 - $32\n $30 - $35\n $35 - $40\n\n\n BullionVault users\n  \n  \n  \n $29\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $24.80\n\n\n Actual Ave. Silver Price\n $23.36\n $28.86\n $29.42\n $31.36\n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 2 January 2025.

That would have marked a new record year-end price, albeit some way short of the all-time highs near $50 reached in January 1980 and April 2011. \n            \n\n               \n            \nHow did AI silver price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?\n\n              ChatGPT got closer than Gemini in estimating silver bullion's price over 2024, although as the chart above shows, ChatGPT had very wide spreads between high and low quarterly prices. On average over the 4 quarters ChatGPT predictions on average varied by 8% compared to the actual quarterly average prices. \n            \n\n              \n            \n\n              BullionVault's users predicted that the silver price would end the year at $29 per ounce which was more bullish than the LBMA analysts' annual average prediction of $24.80 and even more accurate than ChatGPT's projection. \n            \n\n              \n            \n Platinum price predictions \n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT\n $850 - $1,200\n $850 - $1,250\n $850 - $1,300\n $860 - $1,350\n\n\n Gemini\n $930 -$1,000\n $875 - $950\n $875 - $975\n $900 - $1,050\n\n\n BullionVault users\n  \n  \n  \n $1,010\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $1,015\n\n\n Actual Ave. Platinum Price\n $909.63\n $981.20\n $963.30\n $965.85\n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 2 January 2025.

However, ChatGPT 'thought' that platinum prices could go significantly higher.\n            \n\n               \n            \nHow did AI platinum price predictions compare vs human forecasts and the actual price in 2024?\n\n              ChatGPT's price predictions were wildly out compared to the actual quarterly average platinum price. But looking more closely at the chart above, this was due to the extremely bullish nature of the upper price in its forecasted range. \n            \n\n              \n            \n\n              Gemini quarterly price estimates for platinum only varied by 1.0% versus the actual price outcomes over 2024. Combined with its Q4 forecast's midpoint being less than $10 higher the final average Q4 price, Google's AI tool's estimates were more accurate than both BullionVault users and the LBMA analysts' forecasts. \n            \n\n              \n            \n Palladium price predictions \n\n\n\n\n Tool\n Q1\n Q2\n Q3\n Q4\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT\n $1,900 - $2,500\n $1,900 - $2,550\n $1,900 - $2,600\n $1,950 - $2,650\n\n\n Gemini\n $650 - $800\n $700 - $825\n $700 - $850\n $750 - $900\n\n\n BullionVault users\n  \n  \n  \n $1,130\n\n\n LBMA analysts' forecasts\n  \n  \n  \n $1,060\n\n\n Actual Ave. Palladium Price\n $977.84\n $971.86\n $970.27\n $1,010.60\n\n\n\n\n* Quarter-to-date (QTD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLast updated on 2 January 2025.

Back then, the debt was half of GDP. Over the years, our dependence on debt leverage has steadily increased to the point where today it is significantly higher than GDP.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Government wants to increase the debt limit yet again. And they will. The theme (rationale, pipe dream, fantasy) is probably along the lines of sweeping tax cuts meaning that a productive economy will naturally address the debt, allowing pay-down after more debt funds said \"productive\" economy.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Okay, a lotta moving parts there, guys.

This time, though, it was the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) that drove enthusiasm.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Among the top five best-performing S&P 500 stocks, two (Palantir and Nvidia) are directly tied to AI, while two others (Vistra and GE Vernova) benefit indirectly through increased energy demand.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             United Airlines, the fifth-best stock, is reportedly integrating AI to streamline operations like notifications and pilot rebooking, but investor excitement appears largely centered on the recent travel boom and United's $1.5 billion share buyback program.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             AI dominated headlines and the stock market in 2024, pushing companies like Palantir and Nvidia to triple-digit growth.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Palantir, which specializes in data analytics and AI platforms, saw a massive 340% surge in its stock price, making it the best performing S&P 500 stock of 2024. Its work with the Department of Defense has been particularly impactful. Major contracts, such as a $480 million deal for its Maven Smart System and a $401 million follow-on contract for its data-gathering Vantage platform, highlight Palantir's expanding role in military applications.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Meanwhile, \n            Nvidia benefited immensely from its position as the dominant supplier of graphics processing units. The Santa Clara-based company – whose technology powers data centers around the globe, with its GPUs enabling AI applications and Bitcoin mining – generated a jaw-dropping $35 billion in revenue in the third quarter alone as demand for its hardware has soared. As of 6 January 2025, Nvidia was the world's second-largest company by market cap, valued at $3.7 trillion.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Utilities, the lowest-performing S&P 500 sector in 2023, rebounded strongly in 2024, reflecting a major shift in electricity consumption as AI, electrification and decarbonization drive demand.

The company's natural gas and nuclear power plants are well-suited to meet the reliability and scalability needs of data centers. Strategic agreements with cloud computing giants like Amazon and Microsoft to supply power at premium prices further bolstered its financial performance.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             GE Vernova, General Electric's energy spinoff, also saw remarkable growth in 2024, with its stock rising 150% after going public in April. The company's gas turbines have seen strong demand as providers seek to address the growing energy needs of data centers.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Vernova's involvement in renewable energy projects – such as the $2.75 billion wind energy agreement in Australia, signed a year ago – further cements its position as a leader in the sector. The GE spin-off has projected sales of $45 billion in 2028, up from previous estimates of $43 billion.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             United Airlines represented a different investment narrative in 2024: the resurgence of post-pandemic air travel. Shares of the Chicago-based airline soared 135% last year, marking the carrier's best year ever since going public in 2006.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Air travel surged in 2024, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reporting screening a combined 900 million+ passengers at US airports, the most on record. United capitalized on this trend in 2024 by operating its largest-ever domestic schedule and greatly expanding international routes.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Eye-popping passenger volume certainly turned heads, but it was the company's massive $1.5 billion share buyback program, announced in October, that truly boosted investor sentiment.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             On a slightly different note, the correlation between gold and the S&P 500 reached an unprecedented 0.91 in 2024, meaning that the two assets moved in tandem almost 100% of the time throughout the year.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Gold has historically shared an inverse or low correlation with stocks. That's precisely why many investors favor gold.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Take a look at the period from the mid-80s to early-90s. Gold prices were largely agnostic to what equity prices were doing, making the metal an ideal diversifier.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Granted, we've also seen periods of sustained positive correlation (check out the entire 2000s decade), but we've never seen such a strong relationship between the two asset classes as we did in 2024.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So what gives?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             First, global central banks have begun a coordinated monetary easing cycle, cutting interest rates to stimulate economic growth. This has created a favorable environment for both stocks (as borrowing costs declined) and gold, which, as a non-yielding asset, has historically thrived when interest rates were low.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Second, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty have persisted, driving investor demand for safe-haven assets like gold while also supporting equity markets through increased government spending on defense, cybersecurity and infrastructure.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Third, shifts in asset allocation strategies appear to have played a role. Investors increasingly sought diversified portfolios, blending traditional assets like stocks and bonds with alternative investments such as gold and Bitcoin to hedge against inflation (which, despite falling, remained elevated in 2024). I believe this likely contributed to the tighter correlation between gold and S&P 500 stocks."

         "Title:Trump 2.0 Will End Today's Currency Wars\nArticle:Well, that's the plan apparently...\n\n\n              \n           \n\n\nTHERE has been a lot reported in recent days about the return of currency wars, \n            says Jim Rickards in The Daily Reckoning.\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             With Trump 2.0 about to begin, let's review his last term and what to expect in the second.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trump badly bungled his transition after first being elected president in 2016. He was not ready with a long list of loyal appointees. Many of his senior appointments such as Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, and John Kelly as Chief of Staff secretly disliked Trump but accepted their roles as so-called \"adult supervision\" around the supposedly reckless Trump.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             They thwarted his agenda. That backstabbing came on top of the large number of Obama holdovers in the Deep State who saw themselves as a \"resistance\" movement.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trump is doing a better job of preparing for a second term as president, but the resistance is not sitting still either. As reported in the \n            Washington Post, Politico, the \n            Wall Street Journal, Yahoo Finance and other outlets, Trump is working on a secret plan to devalue the US Dollar. The goal would be to cheapen US exports and thereby help the US balance of trade and create exported-related jobs.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But critics say that this will only increase US inflation as Americans have to pay more for their imported goods using cheaper Dollars. The critics also say that other countries will retaliate against the US by cheapening their own currencies (that's the essence of a currency war) and no country will be any further ahead. In fact, the entire world will be worse off.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Before looking more closely at what's actually going on, some basics about a currency war should be explained. The first rule is that the world is not always in a currency war. The periods from 1944 to 1971 (the original Bretton Woods era) and from 1987 to 2010 (the period of the Washington Consensus) were times of currency peace. This contrasts with 1921-1936 (Currency War I), 1967-1987 (Currency War II), and the current period since 2010 (Currency War III).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The second rule is that when we are in a currency war, they can last for fifteen years or longer. It comes as no surprise that the currency war that commenced in 2010 is still going strong 14 years later in 2024. And that points to another key aspect of this debate.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The currency war being written about today by the media is not a new currency war. It's the same one that has been going on since 2010. We're simply in a new phase or a new battle.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It is true that cheapening your currency can import inflation. Sometimes that's a legitimate policy goal if your country has been suffering from deflation. That's obviously not the case in the US today.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It's also true that cheapening your currency can export deflation as trading partners pay less for your goods. That's what China was doing to the entire world from 1994 to 2010 and that's why the US launched a currency war in 2010 – to fight back against disinflation and borderline deflation caused by cheap Chinese goods.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Currency wars can also shift jobs overseas and destroy domestic manufacturing as the terms of trade shift based on changing currency values. Retaliation is always waiting right around the corner in any currency war. The US Dollar hit an all-time low in August 2011, which was consistent with the US goal of trying to import inflation.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But Europe struck back, and the EUR/USD cross-rate crashed from $1.60 to $1.04 as a result. So, it is correct that no one wins a currency war, and everyone is damaged in the process due to volatility, uncertainty, and the costs of conducting the war.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So, are the critics right that Trump has a secret plan to devalue the Dollar? And are they right that this new stage in the currency war will bring inflation and hurt the US economy?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The critics are wrong and don't understand what Trump is actually trying to do. Trump is not trying to start a currency war; he's trying to end it once and for all.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In the first place, no president has the power to unilaterally devalue the Dollar. That might have been possible under the gold standard or some standard of fixed exchange rates, but that has not been the state of the world since 1973.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Exchange rates fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates, industrial growth, exchange controls, central bank interventions, capital flows, tax rates and many other macroeconomic variables. But the idea that the president can just wave his hand and devalue the Dollar is false.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Far from the reckless, inflationary process the media claim, Trump's actual plan is based on the highly successful model developed by James Baker for Ronald Reagan and implemented in the Plaza Accord of 1985 and the Louvre Accord of 1987.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             After the severe economic recession of 1982 and Paul Volcker's policy of moving interest rates to 20%, inflation in the US was finally reigned in. Inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980, to 6.1% in 1982, and then 3.2% in 1983. Investment in the US went on a tear. US real growth was 16% from 1983 to 1986. Everyone wanted Dollars to invest in the US and the Dollar boomed reaching an all-time high in 1985.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Finally, the Reagan administration decided the US Dollar was too strong and was hurting US exports and jobs. Treasury Secretary James Baker convened a meeting of the finance ministers of France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. The purpose was not to fight a currency war. The purpose was to create order in currency markets out of the chaos that had prevailed since 1973.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The parties reached a joint agreement that would devalue the US Dollar in an orderly fashion versus the French Franc, Japanese Yen, UK Pound Sterling, and the German Deutschemark. Once the targeted level for the Dollar was achieved, the parties would use their best efforts, including market intervention as needed to maintain those levels within narrow bands.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             A separate meeting in Paris at the Louvre in 1987 agreed that the devaluation phase was over, and the Dollar would be maintained at the new parities. This was not currency war; it was currency peace achieved by agreement and implemented in a cooperative fashion. The Louvre Accord (this time including the US, UK, France, Germany, Japan and Canada) ushered in a period of global prosperity that lasted twenty years until the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Trump's goal is to repeat the success of the Plaza and Louvre Accords. Trump's advisor on this is Robert Lighthizer, who is one of the most brilliant financial minds around and was Trump's US Trade Representative (2017-2021).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Lighthizer was also USTR for Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1985 so he's a veteran of prior currency wars and was in the administration around the time the Plaza Accord was being developed. Lighthizer is the perfect individual to help Trump achieve the kind of success that Reagan and Baker had in the 1980s.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The media are trying to portray Trump as reckless when in fact he's proposing something highly beneficial for US jobs and US industry. Don't be fooled by false claims of new currency wars. Trump is trying to achieve a new era of currency stability and lasting prosperity."

But surging prices meant that clients of the West London fintech ended 2024 holding 19.0% more value in gold at $3.7 billion...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...up 20.7% in UK Pounds to £2.9bn, 26.4% in Euros to €3.5bn, 31.9% in Japanese Yen to ¥440bn...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...while their securely-stored silver bullion rose 18.0% by value to reach $1.1bn on New Year's Day (up 19.3% in GBP to £869m, 25.0% in EUR to €1.0bn, 30.8% in JPY to ¥172bn).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Record gold prices, in short, spurred record profit-taking in 2024. But private investing in gold or silver didn't shrink as fast as prices rose, even though rising stock markets and the highest real rate of interest on cash savings since before the global financial crisis also encouraged people to bank some of their gains and rebalance their investments.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That shows solid commitment to precious metals as 2025 begins. And surveyed in December, users of BullionVault – nine in 10 of whom live in Western Europe or North America – \n            forecast that gold will now rise 17.6% this year to end at $3070 per Troy ounce, with silver rising 27.6% to $36.90.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             The number of people choosing to sell gold fell in December, dropping 28.2% from November's figure to a 6-month low as gold prices fell by 1.5% against the rising US Dollar (-0.3% in GBP, -0.2% in EUR, +3.0% in JPY). But the number of people starting or adding to their personal gold holdings also dropped, down by 20.8% to the fewest in 3 months.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Together, that edged the \n            Gold Investor Index – a unique measure of private investor activity in physical bullion – down by 0.8 points from November's 17-month high to finish 2024 at 54.3, up 2.9 points from a year earlier.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The index set a decade peak at 65.9 as the Covid pandemic went global in March 2020, and it set a series low at 47.5 in March last year, signalling more sellers than buyers with a reading below 50.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Across the past 12 months on average, the Gold Investor Index slipped 0.4 points to 52.6, its lowest annual level since the reading of 52.2 in 2014, when gold prices were mired in a deep bear market.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Indeed, 2024 was a bull market in price only for Western investing. Gold demand stayed negative for the second year running as profit-taking ran ahead of new buying, because – for Western investors at least – conflict was confined to the ballot box and equity markets rose to new all-time highs.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But that calm now looks fragile as 2025 begins, and Trump's victory in the US election has driven a surge in first-time buyers, particularly across Europe.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The number of first-time BullionVault users worldwide rose 42.4% last year to the most since 2021, almost half of them opening their account in the last 4 months.

But the retreat in silver prices meant that gave the lowest value since July at $1.1bn, down 11.5% from October's record (-8.9% in GBP from £954m, -8.0% in EUR from more than €1.1bn, -9.0% in JPY from ¥189bn).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Gold meanwhile returned to net selling after November's steep price drop \n            snapped a 14-month run of profit-taking, but with BullionVault users selling only 45 kilograms more gold than they bought as a group.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That took client gold holdings down 0.1% to to 44.1 tonnes, more than most central banks hold and larger than all but 13 exchange-traded gold ETF trust funds, but the lowest weight since July 2020 and 4.5% below end-October's record value of $3.9bn (-1.9% in GBP from £3.0bn, -0.4% in EUR from above €3.5bn, -1.8% in JPY from ¥592bn).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\nGold in 2024 made 38 new daily highs in US Dollar terms, matching 2011 – peak of the global financial crisis – with the most fresh records since the inflation-and-geopolitics price surge of 1979.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             For UK, Euro and Japanese Yen investors, gold hit a record number of new records last year, setting 40, 44 and 45 fresh all-time highs respectively."

And it finds that investors are optimistic about gold and silver for 2025 because they are so pessimistic on geopolitics and government debt.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Longer term, that second factor also poses the single greatest threat to the global economy and, therefore, to investment savings over the next 25 years too. Or so genuine investors sharing their thoughts in our survey say.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Between now and 2050, unfunded government spending and the resulting mountain of national debt poses the No.1 challenge for investors according to more than a quarter of BullionVault users taking our survey (28.5%).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That threat is followed by a loss of confidence in government (18.8%) and...for extra fun over the next quarter century...the growing risk of outright war between major powers (17.5%).\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Such happy thoughts come after 2024 proved a remarkable year for gold, topping \n            a stellar quarter-century during which the precious metal has beaten the return from all other assets, even the US stock market.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             While surging demand from households in China and India has supported this move, the switch into gold by private investors and more recently central banks has driven the precious metal to new all-time highs in terms of all currencies.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Nearer to hand, the No.1 driver of precious metals prices in the coming 12 months will be Geopolitics according to almost a third of BullionVault users (31.4%). That's seen it overtake Monetary Policy (down at 16.8%) in BullionVault's New Year survey for the first time since 2022.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             In fact, concerns over the size of Government Budget Deficits and Debt come next, polling one-in-five responses (20.8%) and moving up to second place for the first New Year survey in four. \n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The impact on gold prices?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             The price of gold has risen by 26.4% this year in terms of the US Dollar, its 18th annual gain of the 21st Century to date and its strongest rise since 2007.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Respondents to BullionVault's survey last December forecast that gold would reach $2342 this Christmas. Although 10.1% shy of the current price of $2606, that was much closer than consensus forecasts from bullion-market professionals.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             What's more, BullionVault users then raised their year-end forecast to $2583 in our July survey. That's less than 0.9% off today's current level, a remarkable win as the best gold price forecaster.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Looking ahead, BullionVault's latest survey now forecasts a gold price of $3070 per Troy ounce at the end of 2025, an increase of 17.8% from today's level.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Our survey finds even greater confidence in silver, forecasting an end-2025 price of $36.80 with a projected increase of 26.9% from today.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That might sound dramatic...and the past doesn't promise the future of course. But the more industrially useful precious metal this year recorded its 15th annual rise since Millennium Eve, gaining 21.9%, hitting a run of 13-year highs, and spurring a mid-year hike to investor forecasts to say that silver would trade at nearly $34.50 per ounce by this New Year's Eve.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That $5 over-estimate shows how big gains can invite big expectations, and that can invite disappointment. Because again, the past is no guide to the future as regulators and other spoilsports repeatedly claim.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             To be sure, the turnaround in gold and silver's fortunes so far this century shows how investment trends come and go.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Twenty-five years ago, gold in particular \n            was lost in the investment wilderness...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...unwanted by central banks, unloved by investors, and struggling to find demand from its big consumer markets following the Asian Crisis.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The positive shocks from the turnaround in those factors all now lie in the past. They cannot be repeated.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But the key trends driving gold prices upwards since the Millennium look set to continue, at least for the near-term. And beyond that, geopolitics and worsening government debt will then drive gold and silver higher next year before continuing to harry and harrow the financial markets through to mid-century. Or so the latest survey of the world's largest pool of active precious metals investors predicts.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Let's see what 2025 brings."

If not all of them.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But time is tight, and besides, some things count more than others. The really important stuff might matter to whether you invest in gold over the next 25 years, as well.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So gun to your head, how about we pick three points that stand out?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That's what I asked Matt Turner of Anglo American and Suki Cooper of Standard Chartered at \n            the LBMA's pre-dinner seminars this Christmas.\n              \n           \n #1 Gold Driver No.1: Central banks\n\n             Net-net as a group, central banks just can't get enough of the stuff today. Yet New Year's Eve 1999 found gold bullion loathed by central bankers like never before.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             A century earlier, these same bureaucrats had decided that gold was the be-all and end-all of monetary assets. But the warfare-and-welfare boom of the 20th Century put a stop to that. Element 79 just didn't fit.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Gold vanished from hand-to-hand money in the 1930s, it vanished from backing most countries' money by the 1950s, and it was \n            finally cut from backing the United States' almighty post-war Dollar (and therefore from the rest of the world's money) in the early 1970s.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             A quarter-century later, that left very few central bankers with a memory of gold as a monetary asset, let alone a love for it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So as the Millennium drew near, European and other Western nations were selling gold, while Asian and other 'emerging' nations were too busy fighting currency-and-debt crises of their own to spare any cash on what no one else wanted.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But this marked an extreme, not a new normal. And starting from there...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             ...and after \n            the gold price finally found a floor and turned higher in the early 2000s...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...global selling flipped into strong net demand from central banks when the 'global' financial crisis hit Western economies.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Why? No one sells safe-haven gold during a crisis (not \n            outside the ultimate crisis). So Western central banks stopped dumping it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Just as importantly, the GFC saw interest rates on Dollars, Euros, Yen and Sterling collapse...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...down to zero and even below it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             That forced emerging nations (who now had much bigger reserve-asset stockpiles to defend thanks to globalization sending them huge piles of Western currency to pay for huge piles of energy and cut-price manufactured goods) to spread their risk with a better store of value than the big reserve currencies now offered.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Result? The strongest run of central-bank gold buying since the height of the interwar Gold Standard rush, plus the highest gold prices in history.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Okay, okay. But what else is the No.1 reason for gold's big 21st Century bull market?\n              \n           \n #1 Gold Driver No.2: Gold ETFs\n\n             The boom in investment access to gold can't be understated.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It was 20 years ago last month that the giant GLD \n            gold ETF was launched onto the New York stock market.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             The GLD still accounts for a quarter of total gold ETF holdings worldwide, albeit down from 2/3rds during the global financial crisis. And back in 2004, it enabled US investors to do what a couple of trusts already let Aussie and UK investors do:\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Track the price of gold without owning the metal.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yes, gold ETFs are backed by gold to give their stock-market shares value. And that link meant that, pretty soon, the quantity of gold held to back ETFs also tracked the price. Or vice versa.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Either way, ETF demand has \n            shown a strong and clear connection with the direction of bullion.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             Tangible assets are something which US fund managers in particular can't bear, because they can usually hold only securitized investments in their portfolios, not physical stuff.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Prior to the ETFs, that meant big money either had to buy gold futures or options contracts...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...buying leveraged risk and paying costly derivatives fees to get gold-price exposure...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...or they had to buy gold mining shares, which are NOT the metal but carry management, equity, political and a host of other risks instead.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             So it was – ironically – the same rush of innovation which gave the early 2000s \n            such toxic assets as subprime mortgage CDS and the lethal CDO-squared that gave investors wanting a hedge for all that risk the chance to trade a gold-backed ETF...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...a stock-market quoted, gold-denominated debt security which is the obligation of a trust created for the specific purpose of enabling gold investment through it.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Got all that? Simple folk wanting simple ownership might prefer simpler access. And they also got new gold products in the early 21st Century too.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Yes, market-leader BullionVault, of course...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...now used by over 110,000 people worldwide to invest directly in physical precious metals, and now caring for $5 billion of precious metals for those users today.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             There was also a rash of new coin shops and e-tailers, all rushing to fill the gap which old-school dealers (including your local bank branch) had vacated during gold's long bear market between its 1980 top and the year 2000.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             But for the big money, especially money that didn't care so much about owning any gold, it was ETFs which revolutionized how fund managers could get into the metal. And that access soon meant the size of ETFs showed a remarkable link with the price of bullion.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Between 2004 and 2022 in fact, their 12-month correlation averaged +0.84...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...a number which would read +1.00 if they moved exactly in lockstep, or -1.00 if they moved exactly opposite.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n\n\n\n              \n           \n\n             But as our chart shows, this strong relationship between gold prices and gold ETFs broke down around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...because while Western sanctions against Moscow drove central banks to seek yet more safety in gold, helping support and raise prices, Western money managers just didn’t feel the fear, cutting their holdings and taking profit instead (as did \n            private bullion investors on Russia's all-out invasion too.)\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             This break between ETF flows and gold prices then continued as China’s miserable real-estate and stock-market performance spurred a surge of private Chinese demand this spring.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             More on that another day. Because China really matters. So does India.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             For now, let's not forget what brings our first two Number 1 gold-price drivers together.\n              \n           \n #1 Gold Driver No.3: Fear and loathing\n\n             The DotCom Crash, 9/11, Iraq's WMDs, Katrina, 7/7, subprime, Northern Rock, Lehmans, the Mumbai attacks, Eurozone crisis...\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             ...the first decade of the 21st Century pulled the rug from under public confidence in both government and markets.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Doubt and fear then only deepened during the Covid pandemic, the following surge of inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hamas' attack on Israel, the flattening of Gaza, Russia 'testing' nuclear-capable missiles, and the ever-growing warnings about how Western government debts (and therefore spending) are simply unsustainable.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Instead of enjoying '\n            the end of history', the world has been living through what can feel more like '\n            the end times'. Which is ironic, given the contrast between \n            the giant parties thrown to mark what was popularly known as the Millennium and \n            the 'millennial' end-of-the-world seen in some biblical readings.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Either way, risks unseen and unknown have come to threaten everyone's savings and safety, no matter how cautious.\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             Maybe a lump of uninflatable, indestructible, undefaultable value would help?\n           \n\n              \n           \n\n             It has certainly worked out that way for gold so far this century."

I recount this scene to give you a head start in identifying one of Trump's next battles in his multi-year conflict with the Deep State.\n Starting in 2017, the Deep State tried to impeach Trump, undermine his policy goals, slow-walk his orders to the military, and ruin the 2020 economy with COVID lockdowns.\n Most controversially, it's hard to argue that the Deep State didn't inspire the mysterious shooter whose bullet grazed Trump's ear at a fateful July 2024 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. You, me, and the entire world are wondering, \"What will they do next?\" By \"they,\" I am not referring to a pre-planned conspiracy. There is no single evil mastermind running the Deep State – one who has anticipated every possible countermove.\n No, the Deep State is a faceless blob.\n It is a group of government agencies, media outlets, corporations, and people inside those organizations. They understand that Trump's vision for America is disruptive to their preferred way of doing business. Rather than adapt to Trump's priorities, they see it as a sacred duty to resist him.\n Let's return to the role of Fed Chairman Jay Powell. Powell is trying to serve the American public as best he can, even if he's blind to the Fed's role in promoting wealth inequality and inflation.\n Powell's policies have been too soft on asset owners in our overly financialized US economy. The Fed's asset-pumping policies have exacerbated the wealth gap. It eased policy far too much with trillions of Dollars in money printing and its tightening in 2022 and 2023 has not been nearly so dramatic. The wealth gap, powered by the residual money printed in 2021 and 2022, has played a key role in resurrecting Trump's campaign.\n Trump started from a small base of loyal family members and friends on January 6, 2021, rode a tidal wave of public discontent over rampant Biden inflation, and won the popular vote. The remarkable rebound in support for Trump over three years could not have happened if most Americans were happy with the status quo under Biden.\n We know where most of the American public stands. They are financially worn out and frustrated by the pain of cumulative inflation. Their confidence is low, but many are hopeful that Trump will turn things around quickly. However, turning around this economic ship will not be easy, nor will it be costless.\n The economy is like a large ship that's been heading in a specific direction. Even if Trump steers it sharply in a different, more production-oriented direction, it will take time to see material results.\n Meanwhile, Biden's advisors have for years been steering the economic ship in the direction of bloated government spending, government jobs, and malinvestment in green energy.\n I think it's important to keep this in mind when thinking about Trump's goals starting in 2025: There is a global imbalance between production and consumption, and it's been growing for decades. I support Trump's vision to reprioritize production in America. Our multi-decade trend toward over-consuming with too many government jobs and service jobs is unhealthy and unstable. We've done this while exporting bonds and stocks to foreign producers to fund this consumption.\n Bonds and stocks are securities with explicit or implicit promises to deliver streams of cash flow. Bonds are explicit, pre-defined streams of cash flow. Stocks are implicit promises of future cash flow in the form of dividends.\n Here's why stocks are so volatile: It's difficult – even for diligent professionals – to estimate how large and sustainable their dividends will be for decades into the future. In an all-too-common example, a company that goes bankrupt within a few years of an investor buying its stock rarely pays enough dividends for that investor to recoup his investment in that stock before it goes to zero.\n With that context established, I'll say this: Achieving Trump's vision to reprioritize production in America will involve pain for an economy with an unhealthy addiction to bubbly asset prices.\n There is no easy path to revitalizing American manufacturing. Compromises will be required either way.\n The fact is, the pain from restructuring a bloated federal government means the risk of a recession is high. And when recession risks rise, the Fed slashes rates and gold typically surges higher."
