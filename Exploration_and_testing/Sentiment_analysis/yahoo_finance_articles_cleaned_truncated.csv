Article:Key Points The global logistics robot market is projected to reach $35 billion by 2030, driven by e-commerce growth, labor shortages, and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Symbotic has emerged as a category leader, with $22.4 billion in contracted backlog, 475-plus patents, and blue chip customers including Walmart and Albertsons. Trading at just 12.9 times 2027 projected earnings, the stock offers compelling value for a company dominating warehouse automation. 10 stocks we like better than Symbotic ›   The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics revolution has arrived in American warehouses, and it's happening faster than most investors realize. While headlines obsess over chatbots and image generators, a more profound transformation is unfolding in the physical world: Intelligent machines are taking over the grueling work of moving billions of packages through the supply chain. At the center of this $35 billion market opportunity stands Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM), a company that has quietly assembled the technology, customers, and financial momentum to dominate warehouse automation for the next decade. Here's why this robotics stock screens as a top buy right now.   Image source: Getty Images.   Financial momentum accelerating Symbotic's latest results tell a compelling story of growth. Q2 FY2025 revenue surged to $550 million, up 40% year over year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly quadrupled to $35 million from $9 million in the prior-year period. The company has successfully transitioned from burning cash to generating positive free cash flow, a critical milestone that many high-growth tech companies struggle to achieve.  The real story lies in the company's staggering $22.4 billion contracted backlog. To put that in perspective, that's more than 10 years of revenue at current run rates -- providing visibility that most technology companies can only dream of. With 46 systems currently in deployment and 37 completed sites, Symbotic has demonstrated its ability to execute at scale. Market opportunity analysis The global logistics robot market is projected to reach $35 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 15.9%, according to Grand View Research. Three powerful forces are converging to create unprecedented demand for warehouse automation. First, the surge in e-commerce and omnichannel retailing has created an unprecedented need for efficient, automated warehousing solutions. Companies can no longer rely on manual processes to efficiently meet consumer expectations for same-day delivery.   Story Continues Second, the logistics industry faces an increasing challenge in hiring and retaining warehouse workers, with labor shortages particularly acute in North America and Europe. Rising wages have made automation not just attractive, but essential for maintaining margins.Third, advances in AI and computer vision have finally made warehouse robots smart enough to handle the complexity of modern distribution centers. Symbotic's 475-plus issued patents give it a significant technological moat in this rapidly evolving field.Competitive positioningWhile competitors like AutoStore and Ocado focus on specific niches, Symbotic offers a comprehensive platform that handles everything from pallets to individual items. Its systems can process both cases and individual units (known as ""eaches"" in industry parlance), enabling retailers to fulfill both store replenishment and direct-to-consumer orders from the same infrastructure.The company's GreenBox joint venture with SoftBank (where Symbotic owns 35%) opens up a $500 billion-plus annual warehouse-as-a-service opportunity. This asset-light model could dramatically accelerate adoption by removing the capital expenditure barrier that prevents many companies from automating.Customer validation examplesNothing validates a technology like blue chip customers writing billion-dollar checks. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, recently deepened its commitment by selling its Advanced Systems and Robotics business to Symbotic and selecting the company to develop automated solutions for 400 Accelerated Pickup and Delivery centers.Albertsons, C&S Wholesale Grocers, and seven other major retailers have also committed to multiyear deployments. When companies that collectively move hundreds of billions in goods annually all choose the same automation partner, it suggests the technology delivers real ROI.Symbotic's profitability is masked by its long-term strategySymbotic remains unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, reporting a $21 million net loss last quarter. While adjusted EBITDA was positive, the lack of GAAP earnings continues to deter traditional value investors. But focusing solely on short-term profitability misses the larger story.Symbotic is in active deployment mode, building out automation systems expected to generate high-margin software and service revenue for years to come. At just 12.9 times projected 2027 earnings, the stock looks attractively valued, given the scale of the opportunity.Its core value proposition -- reducing fatigue-related errors and workplace injuries through autonomous logistics -- translates to lower long-term operating costs for customers. These efficiency gains compound over time, strengthening the company's competitive position.Recent developments underscore management's execution strength. The integration of Walmart's robotics operations and the appointment of a new CFO signal strategic progress. With $955 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, Symbotic has the capital to continue scaling without resorting to shareholder dilution.Why Symbotic winsSymbotic holds all the key components for dominating the warehouse automation industry: proven technology, committed blue chip customers, and the capital to scale. While the market is still in its early days, with most warehouses yet to modernize, Symbotic offers savvy, long-term investors a prime opportunity to be at the forefront of the supply chain's digital revolution.Should you invest $1,000 in Symbotic right now?Before you buy stock in Symbotic, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Symbotic wasn’t one of them.

Article:More government debt, more potential opportunities for the crypto bulls. ""One thing that is clear is that democracies around the world are having trouble getting deficit spending under control.

Armstrong said it's not a coincidence that bitcoin prices are hitting records as US debt reaches all-time highs. ""I want the US to remain the reserve currency status,"" he added. ""But if the debt situation doesn't get fixed, I do think that eventually bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency for better or worse.

Each plan reimburses you up to specified limits for routine care, with varying coverage based on your pet’s needs. Preventative Care Covers basic wellness care costs including: Annual wellness exam Up to 3 vaccines, such as Bordetella, Rabies, and DHLPP Fecal or internal parasite test Wellness bloodwork for early disease detection Heartworm or FeLV/FIV test   Preventative+ Care Includes everything in the Preventative Care plan, plus: Flea/tick or heartworm medication Routine dental cleaning  Preventative Care for Puppies and Kittens Designed for younger pets (under 2 years old) with added benefits: Two wellness exams Up to six vaccines, such as Bordetella, Rabies, and DHLPP Fecal or internal parasite test Wellness bloodwork for early disease detection Heartworm or FeLV/FIV test Flea/tick or heartworm medication Spay/neuter procedure Microchip  Learn more: Does pet insurance cover vaccines? Does Lemonade cover preexisting conditions? No, Lemonade doesn’t cover preexisting conditions, which it defines as “any condition for which a veterinarian provided medical advice, the pet received treatment for, or the pet displayed signs or symptoms consistent with the stated condition prior to the start date of the first pet insurance policy issued . . . or during any waiting period.” That said, there’s a little bit of flexibility in most states. Lemonade may cover certain curable preexisting conditions in the future, like diarrhea or roundworms as long as your pet has gone at least 12 months without symptoms or treatment. It’s important to note that chronic conditions (such as asthma, cancer, allergies, etc.) and issues like knee or ligament problems are considered incurable. Therefore, these conditions won’t qualify for coverage in the future. Learn more: Pet insurance that covers preexisting conditions Does Lemonade pet insurance include access to a 24/7 vet telehealth line? No, Lemonade doesn’t offer a 24/7 vet telehealth line. Many other pet insurance companies, like MetLife and Embrace, do provide round-the-clock access to licensed vet professionals who can give guidance for your pet’s health concerns. What does Lemonade pet insurance not cover? Lemonade’s base pet insurance policy doesn’t cover: Preexisting conditions your pet had before coverage began Bilateral conditions (like cherry eye or hip dysplasia), if symptoms showed on one side before your policy started Prescription food Vitamins Microchipping Grooming and nail trimming Cosmetic procedures Anal gland expression Breeding and pregnancy Boarding and transportation Preventable issues, including injuries from abuse, neglect, fighting, or racing Exotic pets like iguanas, guinea pigs, and parakeets  Some things aren’t included in the base policy unless you add extra coverage. Lemonade’s add-ons can cover: Preventive care for vaccinations and wellness visits Vet visit fees for exams Physical therapy, like acupuncture and hydrotherapy Dental illness treatments, such as tooth extractions and care for gum disease Behavioral conditions, like vet-recommended therapy and medication for issues such as anxiety or aggression End-of-life care, including euthanasia, cremation, and memorial items for your pet  Can I increase or decrease my coverage during the policy term? Increases: You can increase your coverage, like adding a wellness plan or raising your coverage limits, within 14 days of buying your policy. After that, you’ll have to wait until your policy renews in 12 months to make any other upgrades. Decreases: You can lower your coverage at any time by using the Lemonade app. Any policy changes may have to be reviewed and approved by the underwriting team. How much does Lemonade pet insurance cost? Lemonade’s base plan is very budget-friendly, but it also has slim coverage compared to many competitors. In our evaluation, Lemonade came in as the cheapest pick. Average pet insurance costs for a $5,000 annual limit Lemonade has the cheapest policy for $5,000 in annual coverage, among the policies we evaluated. It was also 31% less than the overall average cost.  Learn more: Is pet insurance worth it? How to decide. Average pet insurance costs for unlimited annual coverage Lemonade’s cost was also the cheapest among pet insurance companies offering very high or unlimited annual coverage. While Lemonade does not offer an unlimited plan, we compared the cost of its $100,000 policy to competitors. In this category, Lemonade came in 36% less than the overall average.  Does Lemonade have a multi-pet discount? Yes, if you're insuring more than one dog or cat, Lemonade offers 5% or 10% off each policy, depending on your state. The discount applies to the base accident and illness policy and add-ons for the vet exam fee and physical therapy. Discounts don’t apply to the wellness add-on. Can Lemonade pet insurance pay the vet directly? No, Lemonade doesn’t have a system for paying vets directly. If you’re looking for a pet insurer with direct vet payments, check out ASPCA, Healthy Paws, Pets Best, or Trupanion. If your pet insurer doesn’t offer direct pay and you're facing a large bill, such as a surgery, ask your vet ahead of time if they’re willing to set up a payment plan. Your vet may offer payment options like weekly or monthly installments.

Preventative Care Covers basic wellness care costs including: Annual wellness exam Up to 3 vaccines, such as Bordetella, Rabies, and DHLPP Fecal or internal parasite test Wellness bloodwork for early disease detection Heartworm or FeLV/FIV test Preventative+ Care Includes everything in the Preventative Care plan, plus: Flea/tick or heartworm medication Routine dental cleaning Preventative Care for Puppies and Kittens Designed for younger pets (under 2 years old) with added benefits: Two wellness exams Up to six vaccines, such as Bordetella, Rabies, and DHLPP Fecal or internal parasite test Wellness bloodwork for early disease detection Heartworm or FeLV/FIV test Flea/tick or heartworm medication Spay/neuter procedure Microchip Learn more: Does pet insurance cover vaccines? Does Lemonade cover preexisting conditions? No, Lemonade doesn’t cover preexisting conditions, which it defines as “any condition for which a veterinarian provided medical advice, the pet received treatment for, or the pet displayed signs or symptoms consistent with the stated condition prior to the start date of the first pet insurance policy issued . . . or during any waiting period.” That said, there’s a little bit of flexibility in most states. Lemonade may cover certain curable preexisting conditions in the future, like diarrhea or roundworms as long as your pet has gone at least 12 months without symptoms or treatment. It’s important to note that chronic conditions (such as asthma, cancer, allergies, etc.) and issues like knee or ligament problems are considered incurable. Therefore, these conditions won’t qualify for coverage in the future. Learn more: Pet insurance that covers preexisting conditions Does Lemonade pet insurance include access to a 24/7 vet telehealth line? No, Lemonade doesn’t offer a 24/7 vet telehealth line. Many other pet insurance companies, like MetLife and Embrace, do provide round-the-clock access to licensed vet professionals who can give guidance for your pet’s health concerns. What does Lemonade pet insurance not cover?

Lemonade’s add-ons can cover: Preventive care for vaccinations and wellness visits Vet visit fees for exams Physical therapy, like acupuncture and hydrotherapy Dental illness treatments, such as tooth extractions and care for gum disease Behavioral conditions, like vet-recommended therapy and medication for issues such as anxiety or aggression End-of-life care, including euthanasia, cremation, and memorial items for your pet Can I increase or decrease my coverage during the policy term? Increases: You can increase your coverage, like adding a wellness plan or raising your coverage limits, within 14 days of buying your policy. After that, you’ll have to wait until your policy renews in 12 months to make any other upgrades. Decreases: You can lower your coverage at any time by using the Lemonade app. Any policy changes may have to be reviewed and approved by the underwriting team.

Home Depot Targeted in Los Angeles Immigration Raids   On June 6, federal agents targeted a Home Depot in the Westlake area, along with other sites like Ambiance Apparel in downtown L.A., resulting in dozens of arrests.

Article:Payments company Stripe has agreed to acquire New York-based crypto wallet startup Privy for an undisclosed amount. Privy, founded in 2021 by Henri Stern and Asta Li, provides an API for developers to securely create wallets, sign transactions, and integrate onchain systems. The platform currently supports over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 developer teams, facilitating billions in transactions.  Privy’s technology is used across sectors including fintech and payments, decentralised finance (DeFi) and trading, consumer applications, gaming, and AI agents. The startup has raised just over $40m from investors such as Ribbit Capital, Definition, and Coinbase Ventures, according to Bloomberg. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the coming weeks. Privy will continue to operate as an independent product following the acquisition. In a statement, Privy co-founder and CEO Henri Stern said: “When we started, wallets were powerful but inaccessible for all but the most technical. Developers had to send users off-platform to get started, breaking flows and killing user conversion. That friction fundamentally constrained what could be built in crypto.”  The acquisition follows Stripe’s $1.1bn purchase of Bridge. Stripe co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison said: “With a unified platform, connecting Privy’s wallets to the money movement capabilities in Stripe and Bridge, we’re enormously excited to enable a new generation of global, Internet-native financial services.” Earlier this year, Stripe launched stablecoin-funded accounts, enabling merchants to hold funds and pay vendors abroad using Circle Internet Group’s USDC and Bridge-issued USDB.

Through this initiative, firms will gain access to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s accelerated computing tools and AI Enterprise Software, along with improved data, technical expertise, and regulatory guidance to help speed up innovation. UK Regulator Partners with Nvidia to Help Banks Test AI Tools A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. The FCA noted that this program is intended for companies still in the early ""discovery and experiment"" stage of AI adoption, while a separate testing environment is already available for firms further along in development. Jessica Rusu, the FCA’s chief data, intelligence and information officer, made the following comment: “This collaboration will help those that want to test AI ideas but who lack the capabilities to do so. We’ll help firms harness AI to benefit our markets and consumers, while supporting economic growth.” NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the training and operation of advanced AI models. The stock has surged by nearly 4% since the start of 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

Article:Key Points Industry-leading stocks with high yields can still be found even though the market is at lofty levels. With yields as high as 6.7%, these three income stocks are all monsters in the markets they serve. With a Dividend King leading the way, even conservative investors will find these three stocks worth owning for decades to come. 10 stocks we like better than Enterprise Products Partners ›  Advertisement: High Yield Savings Offers  Earn 4.10% APY** on balances of $5,000 or more  View Offer  Earn up to 4.00% APY with Savings Pods  View Offer  Earn up to 3.80% APY¹ & up to $300 Cash Bonus with Direct Deposit  View Offer  Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. The S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is offering a minuscule 1.2% average yield today. That's not much to support a dividend-focused investor's income needs and speaks to a market that is richly valued. Don't give up on dividend stocks, though, because you can still find some great options if you dig a little. And if you do, you'll likely find you want to buy and hold monster stocks like PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), with yields as high as 6.7%, for a decade or more.   Image source: Getty Images.   1. PepsiCo is an out-of-favor Dividend King PepsiCo is one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet. It has operations in the beverage, salty snack, and packaged foods areas, with leading brands in each. It has impressive distribution, marketing, and research and development skills, and it has the size to act as an industry consolidator. Buying other companies is a key part of the company's long-term strategy, as acquisitions allow it to keep its brand portfolio relevant.  The company's impressive 53-year streak of dividend increases speaks to PepsiCo's core strengths. You simply can't become a Dividend King without a good business model that gets executed well in good times and bad. But, like any well-run company, bad times do come. And that's the exact situation today, with PepsiCo's growth slowing down of late. Management is cutting costs, working on innovation, and buying smaller, on-target brands to refresh its portfolio. If history is any guide, it will muddle through this period and get back on the growth path again. If you can take that long-term view, this consumer staples giant is offering a historically high dividend yield of 4.3% today. That's a yield that is well worth the risk for even risk-averse investors. 2. Enterprise Products Partners has a huge 6.8% yield Enterprise Products Partners is one of the largest midstream energy businesses in North America. It owns energy infrastructure assets, like pipelines, that help to move oil and natural gas around the world. Although energy commodity prices can be volatile, Enterprise largely generates income from fees it charges for the use of its assets. Its cash flows tend to be very consistent and, given the importance of energy to the world, resilient even during energy downturns.   Story Continues Enterprise, which is a master limited partnership (MLP), has increased its distribution for 26 consecutive years. The yield today is a very attractive 6.7%. With a yield that high, some conservative investors might be worried about the sustainability of the payout. You don't need to worry, Enterprise has an investment-grade rated balance sheet, and its distributable cash flow covered its distribution 1.7 times over in 2024. There's a lot of room for adversity before the distribution would be at risk. That said, the yield here is likely to make up the lion's share of an investor's return over time, but that probably won't bother income-focused investors.3. Medtronic is a medical device giant working to up its growth and profitsMedtronic is one of the largest medical device makers on Earth. It operates in the cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgical, and diabetes sectors, with leading positions in each area where it competes. Healthcare is a complex sector, but Medtronic has proven its ability to survive, noting it has a 48-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it.The problem with Medtronic today is that growth has been sluggish of late. That's not unusual, given the lumpy nature of medical innovation. After a dry spell, Medtronic is bringing attractive new products to market again. And it is working to streamline its portfolio to enhance growth and profitability. There have been some small divestitures, but the next big move will be to spin off the diabetes business. This move is expected to be accretive to earnings from day one and could be a catalyst for investors to assign Medtronic a higher valuation. But if you act today, you can get this healthcare giant while it still has a historically high yield of 3.2%.Three giants and three giant yieldsIf your goal is to buy industry-leading companies and hold them for 10 or more years, then high-yield PepsiCo, Enterprise, and Medtronic will be right up your alley. Even conservative investors will like these monster stocks, noting that Enterprise is in the least volatile sector of the energy industry. Take some time to get to know this trio of income stocks, and at least one will likely end up in your portfolio today.Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

Amy Danise and Tim Manni edited this article. Methodology We researched the coverage details and prices for 15 pet insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each pet insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best pet insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated. Coverage types: 40% of score.

Article:General Motors (GM) is making a big investment in its US production footprint — in part because of uncertainty over President Trump's tariffs. GM plans to invest $4 billion in certain US plants over the next two years to expand production of some vehicles and reshore production of others from Mexico. “So as we look at our landscape, as we look at the world around us, whether it's the tariff situation, EV adoption, there's a real opportunity to rebalance some of our manufacturing,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said to Yahoo Finance from the Deutsche Bank Auto Conference in Manhattan.

GM will also begin making gas-powered full-size SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and light-duty pickup like the Silverado at its Orion Michigan plant, as well as shift EV production from that plant to the Factory Zero Michigan plant, which produces only EVs.  GM said it was No. 1 in overall full-size pickup sales during Q1, which includes Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models with more than 200,00 units sold — its best first quarter since 2007. GM said full-size pickups also had their best Q1 since 2007, with models like the Tahoe, Suburban, and GMC Yukon seeing sales up 31%. “It's clear that EV demand has slowed a bit, so we're able to fill that back at Factory Zero and really convert Orion to a much better-utilized plant for full-size SUVs, which will get us some incremental capacity and help take some of the pressure off our team at Arlington [Texas], but also full-size trucks where we’ll be able to fill that plant up and have a really secure future going forward for [internal combustion engine] production,” Jacobson said.   2025 Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks are displayed at a Chevrolet dealership in Redford Township, Michigan, U.S., March 27, 2025. REUTERS /Rebecca Cook  · REUTERS / Reuters While rebalancing is a positive in terms of production and shifting powertrains in light of consumer demand makes sense, the moves also address tariffs, at least in the near term. GM said in early May that it would take a $4 billion to $5 billion hit to EBIT due to tariff exposure, though it would mitigate up to 30% of that cost due to remediation and cost-cutting efforts.  Jacobson said that GM’s peak tariff exposure and impact would occur in the second quarter, as the new initiatives will take time to complete.

2025-06-13 14:10:00-05:30,"Title:Microsoft Hits an All-Time High. Here's Why These 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Could Be Next.
Article:Key Points Companies that find new ways to grow earnings can be incredibly powerful investment opportunities. Paying a reasonable price for a quality company is better than paying a dirt-cheap price for a poor business. A strong balance sheet can make a big difference during challenging times. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›   Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hit a new all-time high early on Wednesday -- making it the only company at the moment valued at a market cap over $3.5 trillion. Investors wondering which ""Magnificent Seven"" stock could be next to have come to the right place. Here's the case for why Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could follow in Microsoft's footsteps and soon hit all-time highs, and why both stocks are worth buying now.   Image source: Getty Images.   Within striking distance The simplest reason why Meta and Nvidia could quickly follow Microsoft and hit all-time highs is because both stocks are the next-closest Magnificent Seven members to their all-time highs.   Data by YCharts.  Meta and Nvidia may be close to making new highs, but it's a mistake to buy a stock just to make a quick profit. A better approach is to invest with a long-term mindset, and Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have the qualities necessary to be excellent investments for years to come. Earnings evolution Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. All three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries. Microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the No. 2 cloud computing player behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) across its operations to boost efficiency and grow profit margins.  Instagram became such a prevalent social media app that Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to showcase the company's Family of Apps and virtual and augmented reality investments. Instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. Instagram has helped Meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like TikTok.  It wasn't long ago that Nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, and software for internet applications. But now, the company's compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company's main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations.   Story Continues In Nvidia's latest quarter, which was the three months ended April 27, compute and networking brought in $39.6 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in operating income, compared to $4.5 billion in revenue for graphics and $1.6 billion in operating income. For context, Nvidia's compute and networking for the same quarter just one year ago was $22.7 billion and $17.1 billion in operating income -- illustrating the segment's breakneck growth rate.In sum, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia have undergone considerable transformations in recent years. Newer business segments are arguably the most valuable part of each company -- cloud for Microsoft, Instagram for Meta, and sales for data centers for Nvidia.Fair prices for exceptional businessesWhen a company evolves, it can take the market time to properly value the new business. Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia crushed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the last five to 10 years, especially Meta and Nvidia. And yet, because all three companies are growing profits from their legacy business segments and new markets, their valuations are still reasonable.Microsoft and Meta both have slightly higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios than their five-year median levels. Nvidia's P/E ratio is down considerably since the company wasn't as profitable a few years ago.  Data by YCharts. As you can see in the chart above, expectations for Microsoft and Meta's forward earnings are fairly bleak, since their P/E ratios are just a little higher than their forward P/Es, suggesting low earnings growth. Meanwhile, Nvidia is still expected to grow quickly (but not as quickly as in the last few years), so its forward P/E is a lot less than its present P/E.Still, all three stocks may look expensive at first glance compared to the S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of just 21.7. But given the industry-leading positions of all three companies in rapidly growing industries, their valuations are arguably justified, especially relative to other hot stocks.Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) -- the two most valuable companies in the consumer staples sector -- trade up 139% and 115%, respectively, over the last three years compared to a 46% gain in the S&P 500. But they haven't backed up those gains with considerable earnings growth -- leading to a valuation expansion for both stocks. Walmart has a sky-high P/E ratio of 41.6, and Costco is even more expensive, at 57 times earnings.In an era when investors pay a premium price for high-quality companies across stock market sectors, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia aren't that expensive compared to many other names.Financial stabilityAnother similarity between Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia is that all three companies have impeccable balance sheets.Microsoft finished its latest quarter with $79.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to just $39.9 billion in long-term debt.In its latest quarter, Meta reported $70.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $28.8 billion in long-term debt.Nvidia had $53.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $8.5 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet in its latest quarter.Each company has at least twice as much cash, cash equivalents, and investments as long-term debt, providing an elite level of financial health. Having a strong balance sheet can come in clutch during an economic downturn, a slowdown in a key end market, or a compelling acquisition opportunity.Cut from the same clothMicrosoft, Meta, and Nvidia are ultra-elite Magnificent Seven companies due to their established and legacy business units, opportunities in newer industries, reasonable valuations, and balance sheet strengths. There are the kinds of businesses investors can be confident buying and holding over a period of at least three to five years.It's never easy buying a stock near an all-time high. But if a company continues boosting its earnings year after year, it can grow into its valuation.This concept is why it's better for long-term investors to focus on quality companies than trying to get a weak business for an inexpensive price. Or, as Warren Buffett famously said, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""I'd say that Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia are three wonderful companies at fair prices, making them great candidates for investors to load up on in June.Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

A strong balance sheet can make a big difference during challenging times. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft › Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hit a new all-time high early on Wednesday -- making it the only company at the moment valued at a market cap over $3.5 trillion. Investors wondering which ""Magnificent Seven"" stock could be next to have come to the right place. Here's the case for why Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could follow in Microsoft's footsteps and soon hit all-time highs, and why both stocks are worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images. Within striking distance The simplest reason why Meta and Nvidia could quickly follow Microsoft and hit all-time highs is because both stocks are the next-closest Magnificent Seven members to their all-time highs. Data by YCharts. Meta and Nvidia may be close to making new highs, but it's a mistake to buy a stock just to make a quick profit. A better approach is to invest with a long-term mindset, and Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have the qualities necessary to be excellent investments for years to come. Earnings evolution Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. All three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries. Microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the No. 2 cloud computing player behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) across its operations to boost efficiency and grow profit margins. Instagram became such a prevalent social media app that Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to showcase the company's Family of Apps and virtual and augmented reality investments. Instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. Instagram has helped Meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like TikTok. It wasn't long ago that Nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, and software for internet applications. But now, the company's compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company's main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations. Story Continues In Nvidia's latest quarter, which was the three months ended April 27, compute and networking brought in $39.6 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in operating income, compared to $4.5 billion in revenue for graphics and $1.6 billion in operating income. For context, Nvidia's compute and networking for the same quarter just one year ago was $22.7 billion and $17.1 billion in operating income -- illustrating the segment's breakneck growth rate.In sum, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia have undergone considerable transformations in recent years. Newer business segments are arguably the most valuable part of each company -- cloud for Microsoft, Instagram for Meta, and sales for data centers for Nvidia.Fair prices for exceptional businessesWhen a company evolves, it can take the market time to properly value the new business. Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia crushed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the last five to 10 years, especially Meta and Nvidia. And yet, because all three companies are growing profits from their legacy business segments and new markets, their valuations are still reasonable.Microsoft and Meta both have slightly higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios than their five-year median levels. Nvidia's P/E ratio is down considerably since the company wasn't as profitable a few years ago. Data by YCharts. As you can see in the chart above, expectations for Microsoft and Meta's forward earnings are fairly bleak, since their P/E ratios are just a little higher than their forward P/Es, suggesting low earnings growth. Meanwhile, Nvidia is still expected to grow quickly (but not as quickly as in the last few years), so its forward P/E is a lot less than its present P/E.Still, all three stocks may look expensive at first glance compared to the S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of just 21.7. But given the industry-leading positions of all three companies in rapidly growing industries, their valuations are arguably justified, especially relative to other hot stocks.Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) -- the two most valuable companies in the consumer staples sector -- trade up 139% and 115%, respectively, over the last three years compared to a 46% gain in the S&P 500. But they haven't backed up those gains with considerable earnings growth -- leading to a valuation expansion for both stocks. Walmart has a sky-high P/E ratio of 41.6, and Costco is even more expensive, at 57 times earnings.In an era when investors pay a premium price for high-quality companies across stock market sectors, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia aren't that expensive compared to many other names.Financial stabilityAnother similarity between Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia is that all three companies have impeccable balance sheets.Microsoft finished its latest quarter with $79.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to just $39.9 billion in long-term debt.In its latest quarter, Meta reported $70.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $28.8 billion in long-term debt.Nvidia had $53.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $8.5 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet in its latest quarter.Each company has at least twice as much cash, cash equivalents, and investments as long-term debt, providing an elite level of financial health. Having a strong balance sheet can come in clutch during an economic downturn, a slowdown in a key end market, or a compelling acquisition opportunity.Cut from the same clothMicrosoft, Meta, and Nvidia are ultra-elite Magnificent Seven companies due to their established and legacy business units, opportunities in newer industries, reasonable valuations, and balance sheet strengths. There are the kinds of businesses investors can be confident buying and holding over a period of at least three to five years.It's never easy buying a stock near an all-time high. But if a company continues boosting its earnings year after year, it can grow into its valuation.This concept is why it's better for long-term investors to focus on quality companies than trying to get a weak business for an inexpensive price. Or, as Warren Buffett famously said, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""I'd say that Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia are three wonderful companies at fair prices, making them great candidates for investors to load up on in June.Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Article:The first options-based income ETF tied to GameStop Corp. (GME) launched today, expanding the rapidly growing category of single-stock covered call funds. The Bitwise GME Option Income Strategy ETF (IGME) aims to generate high yields by writing covered calls on shares of GameStop, giving up some upside in exchange for option premium income. The fund, which charges an expense ratio of 0.98%, fell 2.1% in afternoon trading. IGME Joins the Party IGME is just the second ETF tied to the meme stock, following the T-REX 2x Long GME Daily Target ETF (GMEU), a leveraged product that launched in April and has quickly grown to $17 million in assets under management. While most single-stock ETFs have focused on leveraged and inverse strategies, covered call funds have also gained significant traction, especially on volatile names with cult-like retail followings. The YieldMax suite has been particularly successful. The YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY) has amassed $1.2 billion in assets, while the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) now commands a massive $4.8 billion, despite launching just over a year ago. Covered Call Trade-off These funds sell call options to generate yield, offering investors eye-popping monthly income streams. But the strategy comes with a trade-off: capped upside and continued exposure to downside risk. If the stock surges, covered call ETFs miss out on most of the gains. If it drops, they still feel the pain, just slightly cushioned by the income.  That trade-off hasn’t worked out well lately. MSTY is up 109% over the past year, trailing Strategy Inc.’s (MSTR) 149% gain. TSLY has climbed only 39%, while Tesla Inc. (TSLA) jumped 94% over the same period. Still, investors continue to pile in, lured by the big yields and the simplicity of the strategy. Issuers, in turn, are capitalizing on the demand. Like IGME, the YieldMax funds charge hefty fees of around 1%. GameStop's Crypto Connection The GameStop ETF is a curious move for Bitwise, a firm best known for its crypto-focused lineup. On the surface, a fund tied to a video-game-retailer-turned-meme-stock doesn’t quite fit. But there is a crypto connection. Like MicroStrategy before it—once a software firm, now essentially a Bitcoin holding company—GameStop appears to be following a similar playbook. The company recently disclosed it had purchased over $500 million worth of Bitcoin, adding another layer of volatility and intrigue. Bitwise cited the move as part of its rationale for launching IGME, saying, “GameStop’s return potential, historically high volatility, and recent adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset make it a compelling choice for a covered call strategy.”   Story Continues Time will tell if IGME catches fire. For now, retail enthusiasm for GameStop—once the face of the meme-stock movement—has waned and shifted toward names like Strategy and Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR).But with options premiums still elevated and yield-chasing still very much alive, GameStop may yet find a second life in the ETF world.Permalink | © Copyright 2025 etf.com.

Article:US stock futures tumbled on Friday as an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program sites shook global markets, leading oil prices to spike amid fears of a new Middle East war. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) dropped 1.1%, easing slightly from sharper gains in the aftermath of the strikes.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took ""unilateral action,"" saying the US was not involved in the strikes and warning Iran against targeting US interests and personnel.  The dramatic developments came after a day where stocks crept higher despite questions around President Trump's domestic agenda, as he hinted at steps that could rattle markets.

Article:By Lawrence Delevingne and Amanda Cooper (Reuters) -The dollar hit a 2025 low on Thursday but Wall Street stocks continued their recent rally as traders weighed low inflation readings, rising Middle East tensions, and the fragility of a U.S.-China trade truce. U.S. consumer and producer inflation reports showed overall price pressures remained contained in May, largely due to declines in the cost of gasoline, cars and housing, or services like air transport. But most economists expect inflation to pick up as the impact of U.S. tariffs begins to bite.  The dollar, which has lost around 10% in value against a basket of currencies this year, fell to its lowest since April 2022, as weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data for May suggested that the Federal Reserve could resume cutting interest rates sooner rather than later. Global stocks continued an almost-unbroken rally since early April, leaving the MSCI All-Country World index up 0.3%, just below Wednesday's all-time high. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.24%, while the S&P 500 rose about 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.24%.  Shares of planemaker Boeing lost nearly 5% after an Air India aircraft carrying more than 200 people crashed in India's western city of Ahmedabad, and aviation tracking site Flightradar24 said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. Oracle shares rose 13% after the cloud service provider raised its annual revenue growth forecast. European equities logged their fourth consecutive decline on Thursday as trade optimism waned, with the STOXX 600 down 0.3%. Stocks in China and Hong Kong also fell, led by declines in the tech sector.  The U.S. administration said on Wednesday U.S. personnel were being moved out of the Middle East due to heightened regional security risks, which briefly drove oil prices up by 4% before they receded. ""(A flare-up in tensions) is a significant tail risk, but I don't think it is anybody's baseline forecast. So it's something to watch if there is a real escalation there, then markets will take fright and that would have ramifications for the oil price,"" Daiwa Capital economist Chris Scicluna said.  Iran said it will not abandon its right to uranium enrichment, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that a ""friendly"" regional country had alerted Tehran over a potential military strike by Israel.
