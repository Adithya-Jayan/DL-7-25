2025-06-11,"Tittle:When it comes to a US debt default, never say never: Fridson
Article:.NEW YORK, June 11 - “The United States of America is never going to default, that is never going to happen,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on June 1. History suggests that, when it comes to defaults, politicians should never say never..Bessent’s comment was intended to reassure market participants following a sharp run-up in long-term Treasury yields and a Moody’s downgrade of U.S. federal government debt. But the very fact that Bessent thought it necessary to reassure prospective Treasury bond buyers on this point probably gave them pause..It is certainly not unheard of for a Treasury Secretary to raise the topic of default. For example, in 2023 Janet Yellen said that the U.S. should never default on its debt. The consequence of such an event, she warned, would be “an economic and financial catastrophe.”.A default by the U.S. government would also shatter precedent, according to the former Treasury Secretary. As she put it, “Since 1789, the United States has paid all our bills on time.”.Or so she claimed. But in reality, the country’s record on meeting its financial commitments is not quite so immaculate..Here are a few instances over the past two and a half centuries when the U.S. government did not quite deliver what it promised..In 1814, the financial burden of the war with Great Britain prevented the Treasury from scrounging up enough cash to service its debts. “The dividend on the funded debt has not been punctually paid,” Alexander J. Dallas, the sixth U.S. Treasury Secretary, acknowledged. “A large amount of Treasury notes has already been dishonored.”.In 1862, the costs of fighting a war once again strained the U.S. Treasury. In response, the government paid its bills by printing pure paper money, so-called “greenbacks,” at a time when the dollar was still legally pegged to gold. During the Civil War, the greenback depreciated sharply versus gold whenever the Union army suffered a setback..And then there was the abrogation of the gold clause. Up until Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, Treasury bonds were sold with a contractual clause stating that holders could demand payment in gold. However, a joint resolution of Congress revoked that clause on June 5, 1933, and the Supreme Court upheld the Congressional action on dubious legal grounds..There have been a few other instances, including the government’s refusal to redeem ‘silver certificates’ for the precious metal beginning in 1963 and a computer glitch in 1979 that caused promised payment to be delayed..The mistaken belief in a spotless U.S. credit record is unsurprising given widespread misconceptions about sovereign debt..For example, Modern Monetary Theory, a school of thought that gained many adherents in the years leading up to the pandemic, posited that a country never had to default on debt denominated in its own currency because it could simply print more money to meet its obligations..While this might be true in theory, it certainly isn’t in practice. To cite one comparatively recent counterexample, Russia defaulted on its ruble-denominated bonds in 1998..What is more accurate to say is that no bankruptcy process exists for sovereign nations comparable to bankruptcy codes for corporations, but sovereign defaults remain a risk..So where does this leave the U.S. debt situation today? On the positive side, the U.S. is nowhere near the brink of default. However, with U.S. debt to GDP above 120% and rising, the notion of a default can no longer be dismissed with a derisive laugh..Whether that calamity can be avoided over the long term will depend on Congress finding the political will to stop the government’s outlays from galloping ever further ahead of its income..Investor concern about the increasing danger of default over time is suggested by the recent behavior of Treasury bonds of various maturities..The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds soared from a low of 4.43% on April 4 to a peak of 5.09% on May 21, as anxiety about the U.S. deficit grew with the emergence of more details about the Trump Administration’s tax and spending bill. Over that interval, the 30-year Treasury returned -9.39%. Treasury performance improved as maturities shortened, culminating in a positive return of 0.50% for 90-day Treasury bills..A similar correlation between maturity and performance can reasonably be expected if the recent Treasury market rebound reverses..And speaking of what to expect, if fiscal matters ever do get to the point where the U.S. actually does default on its debt, you can be sure that whoever is Treasury Secretary will insist, right up to the end, “That has never happened before, and it will not happen now.”.(The views expressed here are those of Marty Fridson, the founder of FridsonVision High Yield Strategy.

2025-05-17,"Tittle:Trading Day: Market elation trumps brewing stagflation
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, May 16 (Reuters) - - TRADING DAY.Making sense of the forces driving global markets.By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist.If anyone wanted a snapshot of the tight spot the U.S. economy and policymakers are in right now, they got it on Friday via theUniversity of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment and inflation expectations survey..The results were eye-popping: consumer sentiment expectations are now the lowest since 1980 and one-year inflation expectations are the highest since 1981, above 6%..Sentiment surveys are only 'soft' data and there is much debate whether they translate into the 'hard' activity data like retail sales and hiring. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month the link between the two in recent years has been ""weak"" and he has previously downplayed the U-Mich inflation expectations figures..But the direction of travel is getting harder to ignore. Consumers are spooked by President Donald Trump's trade war and fear tariffs will push up prices, forcing them to curtail spending. If this soft data filters into the hard data, the economy could be in the grip of 'stagflation' later this year..This calls into question the sudden optimism that washed across financial markets following theUS-China trade truce. It's hard to believe it's been less than a week since the world's two largest economies agreed to reduce reciprocal tariffs and put them on pause for 90 days..The speed with which economists raised their growth forecasts on the detente, and the scale of the rally across financial markets, was pretty remarkable considering the damage from tariffs has yet to be felt and the amount of uncertainty that is still hanging..But markets brushed all that aside and ended a remarkable week on a strong footing.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied 5% and 7%, respectively, to their highest in two months, and the Nasdaq is up 30% since April 7. The Dow's rebound means it has recouped its 'Liberation Day' losses and is now flat for the year..Other markets have moved a lot too.Germany's DAX hit a record highand is also up 30% from the April low, the MSCI World index has risen in 17 of the last 19 sessions, and safe-havengold fell 4%, its steepest weekly loss this year..The U.S. and European earnings season is drawing to a close, and although some big firms pulled guidance or issued profit warnings due to the tariff uncertainty, results and the outlook were broadly positive..Renewed growth optimism, therefore, would appear to be partly behind the rebound in bond yields. Fed rate cut expectations and projections for furtherChinese stimulus have been pared back, pushing up bond yields in both countries and beyond..But U.S. fiscal worries are also brewing, and on FridayRepublicans rejected President Donald Trump's tax packagebecause it didn't go far enough on spending cuts. Watch this space..Underscoring how difficult it is to make economic forecasts in these highly uncertain times, this week threw up some big data surprises - unexpectedlystrong UK GDP growthin the first quarter,weaker-than-expected GDP in Japan, and the steepest fall inU.S. producer pricessince 2009..You wouldn't bet against similar surprises next week..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments atjamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com, opens new tab.

More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments atjamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com, opens new tab. You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social..If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..Today's Key Market Moves.Taking the positives from trade, China, Fed.If ever a day in financial markets reflected the thick fog of uncertainty surrounding the global trade, growth and policy outlook, Wednesday was that day..Investors initially welcomed thewave of policy easing measures from Chinaand confirmation thatU.S.-China trade talkswill open this weekend. But skepticism soon set in that Washington and Beijing would make much progress. It's a welcome first step, but the road ahead could be long and difficult..The Fed's decision was widely expected and Powell's press conference offered little clarity, leaving investors struggling for direction. If there was a thread running through markets, it was difficult to spot..Wall Street rallied in the last half hour of trading after trading in the red most of the day, yet long-dated Treasuries rose after Powell flagged risks to growth. Gold fell, in part on easing U.S.-China trade tensions, yet oil fell on skepticism these talks will yield much..Either way, U.S. Treasury Scott Bessent, who along with chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer will meet China's economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland, characterized the meeting as the beginning of ""negotiations"". It's a start..It will be interesting to see how markets in Asia, especially China, open on Thursday in a follow-on reaction to the trade developments and stimulus steps. Currency traders will note that China's central bank leaned against mounting downward pressure on the currency on Wednesday and set its daily fix at its strongest yuan level in a month..$1 trillion basis trade has barely barked, let alone bitten.Amid all the uncertainty surrounding U.S. growth, Federal Reserve policy, and the attractiveness of the dollar, the U.S. bond market is remarkably tranquil, calling into question long-held fears about the massive 'basis trade'..While Treasuries experienced a brief bout of volatility following the Trump administration's 'Liberation Day' tariffs last month, including a spike in long-term yields and dislocation in 30-year swap spreads, the $29 trillion market has withstood everything thrown at it..Indeed, positioning in Treasury futures has quietly risen in recent weeks and is now close to a record aggregate peak across two-, five- and 10-year contracts. In the five-year space, both 'long' and 'short' positions have never been higher..The Treasury futures market is where hedge funds operate the basis trade, an arbitrage that profits from making highly levered bets on tiny differences between the price of cash bonds and futures..Global financial authorities have repeatedly warned that, if suddenly unwound, these positions – levered up to 100 times – could pose a threat to financial stability, as sharp price swings could trigger a devastating dash for cash and scramble to cover..But that hasn't happened yet, despite all the market volatility over the past month..Instead asset managers and leveraged funds are steadily building their 'long' and 'short' positions, respectively. Aggregate holdings across two-, five- and 10-year futures contracts are all comfortably above $1 trillion in notional terms. Speculators seem happy to continue peeling off the pips in the basis trade, and asset managers are happy to lock in yields between 3.80% and 4.20%..""It's maybe a little surprising how fast these positions are being rebuilt, but it shows a generally salient view leveraged investors have in the functioning of the repo and Treasury markets,"" says Steven Zeng at Deutsche Bank..Treasury market depth may be a bit thinner than normal but it's nowhere near crisis levels, and there's no sign of the funding stress of late 2018, or September 2019 when the Fed was forced to inject liquidity into the market..The 'MOVE' index of implied Treasury market volatility has come down almost as quickly as it spiked in early April and is now below its average of the last three years..Overnight repo rates, which hedge funds can use to fund the basis trades, spiked at the height of the tariff turmoil a month ago, but that was an insignificant blip compared to the surges in 2018 and 2019. Repo rates are now in the middle of the Fed's 4.25-4.50% policy target range..Meanwhile, New York Fed data shows that the volumes of overnight cash borrowed at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) hit a record $2.8 trillion at the end of April. That suggests liquidity is ample, demand is strong and investors have confidence in this source of funding. These all appear to be signs of a well-functioning market..True, there is some sign of elevated anxiety in the Treasury market. The 'term premium' - the risk premium investors demand for buying longer-dated bonds rather than rolling over short-dated loans - has risen to the highest in a decade..And there is always the risk that a sharp spike in borrowing costs – perhaps driven by another policy surprise or twist in the ongoing trade war – could put the basis trade in peril. But then what?.If things did start to unravel, the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department would almost certainly come in with a backstop to preserve financial stability and maintain bond market functioning..So despite the fearmongering, the $1 trillion 'basis trade' remains the dog that has barely barked, let alone bitten. Perhaps the deepest and most liquid market in the world is simply more robust than some Cassandras would have you believe..What could move markets tomorrow?.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

But while the U.S. central bank said the economy continued to expand at a solid pace, it noted that risks of higher inflation and unemployment had risen as it grapples with the impact of Trump's tariff policies..The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation left the Fed with almost no good short-term options, said Julia Hermann, global market strategist at New York Life Investments..""Their ability to preemptively cut rates to shore up economic growth is constrained by upside inflation risks, and then, conversely, their ability to preemptively hike rates to reduce inflation risk is constrained by downside risk to growth,"" she said.

Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, May 6 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY.Making sense of the forces driving global markets.By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist.Deep uncertainty, thin patience.Investors dumpedU.S. stocksandthe dollaron Tuesday as the optimism of the recent rebound continued to fizzle, and was replaced by renewed pessimism about the economic and market damage from the global trade war..Thesurge in Asian currenciesover the last few days caught many investors off guard, and highlights the acute challenges policymakers in the region face.

You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social..If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..Today's Key Market Moves.Absent tariff clarity, nerves fray.After a few weeks smoldering in the background, investors' worries over trade, tariffs and growth are very much back on the front burner..Figures on Tuesday showed theU.S. trade deficit swelled to a record$140.5 billion in March as businesses increased imports to beat the tariffs. Imports from 10 countries hit record highs but purchases from China fell to a five-year low, a result of Washington's 145% tariffs on its main economic rival..Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, calculates that the deficit widening at that quarterly rate drags down GDP by two percentage points on an annualized basis. ""Ouch!"".This set the tone. Although stocks briefly recovered some losses after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would make a ""very big"" announcement before his visit to the Middle East next week, Wall Street was in the red all day..Short-dated bond yields and the dollar fell, the yield curve steepened and gold prices rose more than 2% for a second day to within sight of last month's record $3,500 an ounce..This is the backdrop against which theFederal Reservebegan its two-day policy meeting. It will almost certainly hold the line on Wednesday, with Chair Jerome Powell expected to say more incoming data is needed before deciding the next move. Traders are betting the Fed will resume its easing cycle in July, but some economists reckon high inflation will prevent any rate cuts at all this year..On the trade front,U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentsaid agreements with some of the United States' largest trade partners could be unveiled as early as this week. Markets are reluctant to get too excited though - the fact remains, Washington has yet to announce a single trade deal..One was announced on Tuesday though, betweenBritain and India. However, it should be noted that the on-and-off negotiations had been underway for three years, and the projected 4.8 billion pound boost to Britain's economy by 2040 is less than 0.2% of last year's GDP of 2.6 trillion pounds..Trade talks can be tough, and the final agreements not always particularly earth-shattering..Asia FX surge raises doubts about region's trade war arsenal.The Taiwan dollar's record rise in recent days has brought a regional conundrum into sharp focus: how much appreciation can Asian currencies countenance in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war?.Currency depreciation would typically be the weapon of choice for Asian policymakers seeking to mitigate the export and growth shocks caused by a trade war. But many Asian currencies are moving in the opposite direction..The Taiwan dollar's 6% rise against the greenback over Friday and Monday marked a record two-day spike. It's unclear what sparked the surge of capital into a market that was 'long' dollars and unhedged. Many analysts say it was speculation that Taiwan had agreed to allow its currency to strengthen as part of an upcoming trade deal with Washington, a claim Taiwan's central bank and president have strenuously denied..But regardless, what matters is that the Taiwan dollar's jump didn't come in isolation, raising doubts over Asia's willingness or ability to use FX as a trade war shock absorber..In parallel with the Taiwan dollar's record move in recent days, the South Korean won on Monday also clocked its biggest two-day rally in 15 years, while China's offshore yuan hit a six-month high. China's markets reopened on Tuesday for the first time since Thursday, and the onshore renminbi gapped sharply higher too..On Saturday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority sold HK$46.54 billion ($6 billion) of local currency to prevent it from strengthening beyond its official band between 7.75 and 7.85 per U.S. dollar. That was the HKMA's first such action in four and a half years and its largest-ever intervention in the FX market..And even though the Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Vietnamese dong were all recently at record lows against the U.S. dollar, they have begun to ride the continent-wide crest of rising currencies in recent days, especially the rupee..This is exactly what Trump wants. Some of America's biggest bilateral trade deficits are with Asian countries who Trump says have ""ripped off"" the U.S. for years, in part, because, he argues, they have kept their exchange rates artificially weak through central bank intervention and by accumulating huge foreign currency reserves..Indeed, six of America's top 10 bilateral trade deficits last year were with Asian countries, topped of course by China. America's combined deficit with these six countries last year was more than $650 billion..It's also true that many Asian countries closely manage their currencies to varying degrees or regularly intervene in the market ostensibly to limit volatility but implicitly to exert some control over the exchange rate..How much any of this is 'fair' or 'unfair' trade is highly debatable. But what is not up for debate is that the region will face immediate challenges in an environment where the question is how far Asian countries can let their exchange rates rise..All else being equal, a strengthening currency will make these countries' exports less competitive on the international market, but appreciation could be a price worth paying if it secures less punitive trade deals with Washington. The weighted average U.S. 'reciprocal' tariff on Asia is over 40%, up from around 12% before Trump's trade war, MUFG analysts estimate..On the other hand, intra-Asian trade is more important than ever, expanding 43% over the past four decades to more than half of all Asian trade, according to the International Monetary Fund. Consequently, ceding some competitive advantage to the U.S. via the dollar exchange rate will be less meaningful than relative regional competitiveness. This may limit Asian countries' tolerance for local currency strength..The other issue Asian policymakers may struggle with is dollar weakness more broadly. There was a widely held belief in the months surrounding Trump's election win last November that his tariff agenda would stoke U.S. inflation, force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and therefore boost the dollar..But while price pressures and inflation expectations have indeed intensified in recent months, U.S. growth is weakening, and markets expect the Fed to cut rates this year. On top of that, a risk premium has been built into the dollar's price as Trump's erratic and controversial policies have prompted many investors to reassess their willingness to hold U.S. assets..Considering all this, Asian policymakers face huge challenges in determining how best to respond to the U.S. trade salvos. But one thing is for sure, 'weaponizing' FX may no longer be the obvious option..What could move markets tomorrow?.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social..If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..Today's Key Market Moves.Tariff uncertainty still runs deep.World markets are in limbo, with investors hoping for concrete progress in Washington's bilateral trade deal talks with dozens of countries but wary that the rally in risk assets over the past month could be losing momentum..Trump's decision on Sunday to slap 100% tariffs on foreign-made movies brought into the U.S. was a sign that perhaps he isn't turning quite as conciliatory as investors had hoped. Or it may be a reminder of how erratic his tariff policymaking agenda still is..Either way, it was enough to help snuff out Wall Street's nine-day upswing on Monday, in contrast to key markets in Asia and Europe that maintained their longest winning streaks in years. Will they run out of puff on Tuesday?.It might be a low bar, but there were two developments over the weekend that could help investors keep a 'glass half full' view of markets -Trump pledged not to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and Japan's finance minister Katsunobu Kato said Japan has no plans to threaten to sell its $1 trillion-plus holdings of U.S. Treasuries in trade talks with Washington..And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday repeated his belief that tariffs, alongside the administration's tax cuts and deregulation agenda, will drive growth to near 3% this time next year..The U.S. economic data is mostly coming in on the stronger side of expectations, giving the Fed more breathing space, although how much longer that lasts remains to be seen..Some Asian currencies are clocking their biggest gains in years, and on Mondaycar giant Ford pulled annual guidance. Tariff uncertainty is still running deep..Wall Street's 'fever dream' could end in cold sweats.Wall Street's recent rebound from its April lows suggests equity investors are pricing in a benign outlook for the U.S. economy, which contrast starkly with the more ominous signals coming from the oil, gold and fixed income markets. Is this justified confidence, or dangerous complacency?.If you had turned off all communications on April 2 and logged back on today, you would find the S&P 500 roughly unchanged, with no sign of the 15% slump suffered in the days immediately following President Donald Trump's April 2 tariffs announcement..The S&P 500 has risen nine days in a row through May 2, its best daily winning streak in 21 years. Meanwhile, the ""S&P 493"" - the broad index excluding the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech megacaps - is flat for the year to date, also remarkable given the tumult over the past four months..Contrast that with other markets..Oil on Friday had its lowest close in four years and is down 25% on a year-on-year basis. While this partly reflects calls for accelerated output hikes by OPEC+, the macroeconomic signals flashing here are pretty clear: weak demand, sluggish growth and disinflation..Gold, meanwhile, is up 25% this year and still above its ""Liberation Day"" close, despite drifting down from its recent record high of $3,500 an ounce. While this is not an indication of heightened disinflation fear, it is a sign of elevated fear overall. Bullion's allure as the world's premier safe-haven asset has rarely been stronger..And what of U.S. Treasuries? The two-year yield has rebounded in recent days but is still 40 basis points lower this year, and rates traders are still anticipating at least three quarter point cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. Both are pricing in meaningful economic slowdown..Is this simply an example of the old adage that equity investors are paid to be optimistic while bond investors are paid to be pessimistic?.Perhaps, but there is some justification for Wall Street's optimism. It's largely rooted in the view that the economic damage inflicted by tariffs won't be as bad as feared a few weeks ago, partly because the Trump administration has backpedaled in the face of market ructions. In other words, the ""Trump put"" is back..Investors also have reason not to be too worried about the 0.3% GDP contraction in the first quarter, as it largely reflects the front-loading of imports, a statistical anomaly that will be quickly reversed..It was a ""gross distorted product"", according to Goldman Sachs economists, who anticipate a 2.4% GDP expansion in the second quarter..Moreover, while ""soft"" economic data like consumer sentiment indicators continue to flash red, much of the ""hard"" data, like employment figures, is holding up well..And even if real growth this year is only 0.5% - Goldman's estimate, which is at the lower end of forecasts - that still implies nominal growth of close to 5%, if inflation tops 4%, as many economists expect..Importantly, earnings are driven by nominal growth rates. While first quarter earnings are obviously ""rear-view mirror"" numbers in the context of the trade war, around 74% of the 357 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far have beaten analyst estimates, according to LSEG's Tajinder Dhillon. This compares to a long-term average of 67.0%..And the 12-month forward growth expectations for the S&P 500 are still running at a punchy 10%..But that's not the whole story. Many firms have slashed forecasts or declined to give any guidance at all..Even though Trump seems very likely to dial down his initial tariff numbers, the cost of doing international business is still going to rise significantly. Whether that cost is borne more by businesses or consumers remains to be seen, but in the broader context of economic activity and corporate profitability, the effect will be the same..Tariffs haven't bitten yet, but they will. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday, Gene Seroka, executive director of the Los Angeles port - the biggest in the country - pulled no punches: ""CEOs are telling me, 'hit the pause button'. Hiring, off the table for right now. Capital investment, pause. And the retailers are telling me that even 10% (tariffs), 'I'm going to have to pass it on to the consumers'."".Bob Elliott, CEO at Unlimited Funds, reckons equities are priced as if the last month was a ""fever dream"".

But with the credibility of U.S. policymaking and governance at the root of the market turbulence, Treasuries andthe dollarare longer part of that club of core 'safe haven' assets..More on that below, but first, a round-up of Monday's main market moves. I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments atjamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com, opens new tab. You can also follow me at@ReutersJamie, opens new taband@reutersjamie.bsky.social, opens new tab..If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets..Today's Key Market Moves.Trump pummels Powell.The U.S. President is known more for doubling down than backing down, so in that sense his renewed attacks on Fed Chair Powell should come as no surprise. But they are still no less astonishing for that..In a pointed post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said the U.S. economy is headed for a slowdown ""unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates NOW."".It is the latest in a series of criticisms that investors see as blatant attempts at political interference with the monetary policy setting process, and direct attacks on the central bank's independence..Investors are understandably spooked. Economist Phil Suttle says the twin selloff in Treasuries and the dollar suggest U.S. markets are ""giving off distinct emerging market tendencies,"" while Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management notes that U.S. markets are on the cusp of a cross-asset drop not seen for 35 years..Cox calculates that the last time the S&P 500 was down 8.5%, the dollar was lower, and the 10-year Treasury yield rose in the same calendar month was August 1990..The S&P 500's bounce off its lows late on Monday means the index is currently down 8.1% this month, so we're not quite there yet. But it's close, and in the current climate, few would bet against it..The clearest winner in this turbulence is gold. Since hitting a post-'Liberation Day' low of $2,955 an ounce on April 7, bullion has risen 15% through $3,400/oz. What appeared to be extremely bullish forecasts of $3,500/oz earlier this year no longer seem so outlandish..Beyond Trump's spat with Powell, investors are also trying to navigate a global trade war. Trump's recent 90-day pause in many U.S. tariffs offered welcome relief, but trade could come back to haunt markets this week as hundreds of global finance leaders descend on Washington for thesemi-annual gatherings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group..Dollar would be biggest casualty if Trump fires Fed Chair.If U.S. President Donald Trump wants a weaker dollar, threatening to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a sure-fire way of getting it..But rarely in markets, economics and policymaking has the phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" ever been more apt..Trump's frustration with Powell for not lowering interest rates goes back to his first term in the White House, but his latest verbal attacks mark an escalation that could quickly turn a dollar slump into a potentially catastrophic rout..That's not hyperbole. The dollar is down 9% this year and has lost almost 6% of its value this month alone, a slide that accelerated when Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs threw markets into a downward spiral of uncertainty and confusion..The dollar's decline this year has wiped out all of last year's gains, which is quite a feat considering the tsunami of capital inflows as investors around the world plowed trillions into Wall Street on the back of the ""U.S. exceptionalism"" story..Measured against a basket of major currencies, the dollar is on track for its steepest monthly decline since the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09, and its eighth biggest since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced more than 50 years ago..Excluding the GFC, the last time the dollar fell this much in a calendar month was in 1985, just before five countries agreed to weaken what was legitimately an overvalued dollar via the famed ""Plaza Accord"" in September of that year..The scale of dollar selling underway now is historic, and worryingly for policymakers, it appears to be rooted in concern about the direction and credibility of U.S. policymaking..There's almost nothing that could undermine credibility in a country's economic policymaking – and its currency – more than forcibly removing the head of the central bank: Even in the United States and even the dollar. Or perhaps, especially in the U.S. and especially the dollar, because of the outsized role both play in the global financial system..Former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren put in plainly on Monday when he wrote on the social media platform X: ""Unless the goal is to make the US trade like a third-world country, threatening Federal Reserve independence only makes the US less attractive to foreign investors."".Of course, the doomsday scenario may be avoided. Trump could back down or soften his stance, Powell might decide to voluntarily step down to limit the damage, or markets could take the view that his replacement may not be so bad after all. But right now, there's little to suggest any of those scenarios will play out..In the near term, Powell's exit would probably prompt an immediate, dovish repricing of the Fed's rate outlook..Traders currently expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 100 basis points this year to 3.25-3.50%, but that's with Powell attempting to balance growth concerns with any rising price pressures. A Fed more in tune with Trump's thinking would tilt that balance in the direction of more easing..But that's only part of the story because continued dollar weakness wouldn't be welcomed by other countries, whose currencies would be rising in value against the greenback. Moreover, shattered faith in the dollar would risk unleashing tremors that could rip through global markets in unexpected ways. Official intervention would surely come at some point..But would it succeed?.""Fending off a speculative attack (on the dollar) would be challenging,"" warns economist Phil Suttle, even for the Fed, as U.S. rates would probably be falling in such a fevered ""risk off"" environment..Redrawing the world's economic architecture is one of Trump's economic goals. Political interference in the central bank, unmooring inflation expectations and torpedoing the world's faith in the dollar would certainly do that, but it's a high price to pay..Online prediction market Polymarket is currently attaching a 19% chance to Powell getting fired by the end of this year, up from around 15%, where it has hovered for most of this year, but down from as high as 23% last week. Unless Trump has a sudden change of heart, this probability - and pressure on the dollar - is likely to rise..What could move markets tomorrow?.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, April 17 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY.Making sense of the forces driving global markets.By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist.Trump is Fed up.If Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellwas cautious and mildly hawkish in his outlook for U.S. monetary policy on Wednesday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was bold and dovish on Thursday, as theECB cut interest ratesfor a seventh time in a year and left the door open to more easing..Back in Washington, U.S. PresidentDonald Trump escalated his long-running feud with Powell, accusing him of ""playing politics"" and saying his ""termination"" can't come quickly enough.More on that and more below, but first, a round-up of the day's main market moves..I'll be off tomorrow as the U.S. stock market will be closed for the Good Friday holiday, but Trading Day will be back on Monday.

You can also follow me at@ReutersJamie, opens new taband@reutersjamie.bsky.social, opens new tab..If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets..Today's Key Market Moves.ECB acts, Trump attacks.In 'normal' times, the ECB cutting rates and signaling it is ready to potentially cut them much further might be expected to be the driving force in world markets that day. TheInternational Monetary Fund's warning of a ""notable markdown"" in global growth might also have come across investors' radar..But with the Trump administration triggering a global trade war and seemingly bent on upending the global economic order of the past 80 years, these are not normal times. What is next, Trump firing Powell or forcing him out?.Nobody knows. But one thing is certain - Trump raised the stakes on Thursday to a whole new level, first in a social media post on his Truth Social platform and later speaking to reporters at the White House..Powell and his colleagues face an unenviable dilemma, one which is a direct consequence of Trump's tariffs - the slowing economy calls for rates to be cut, but rising inflationary pressures might require them to be raised..Trump clearly wants lower rates, but Powell said on Wednesday the Fed will continue its 'wait and see' approach before acting one way or the other..The immediate market impact of Trump's latest attack on Powell - and by extension, attack on the Fed's independence - was to erase the dollar's and Wall Street's gains, and keep long-term Treasury yields at their highs for the day..Looking ahead if this crisis deepens, investors are likely to view it as the latest in a lengthening list of reasons not to hold U.S. assets. That points to a weaker Wall Street, a lower dollar, and higher Treasury yields..Long-dated yields are already marching higher and the 'term premium' is at its highest in a decade. Faith in the dollar and Treasuries, confidence in U.S. economic policy, and trust in U.S. institutions and governance have rarely been lower..Fed independence and the prospect, remote or otherwise, of a new Trump-appointed Fed chair before Powell's term ends in just over a year's time will give investors plenty of food for thought over the long weekend and Easter holiday..Risk of Powell firing is too big to price.Just like a global trade war, the dismissal of the chair of the Federal Reserve by the U.S. President is an event investors know will be unequivocally bad for markets. But it is also a risk that is too far-reaching to properly quantify, meaning the market might be forewarned, but it won't be forearmed..U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his feud with Fed Chair Jerome Powell - who Trump himself nominated in 2017 – writing on social media that ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough"" and later telling reporters that the Fed chair is ""playing politics""..Trump's social media broadsides against Powell for not cutting interest rates are so numerous that jaded investors could be forgiven for dismissing them. But they shouldn't..Trump's salvo on Thursday comes only days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for him to fire Democrats from two federal labor boards before their terms expired, a move that some lawyers and analysts argue could leave Fed officials like Powell vulnerable. Powell said on Wednesday he didn't think this applied to the Fed, but he wasn't sure..This latest tirade comes at an extremely dangerous moment for U.S. and world markets. Faith in the dollar and Treasuries, confidence in U.S. economic policy, and trust in U.S. institutions and governance have rarely been lower..This is putting upward pressure on the 'term premium' in the U.S. bond market. That's the somewhat amorphous level of compensation investors demand for taking the risk of lending to the U.S. government over the long term rather than rolling over shorter-term loans. The term premium is at its highest in a decade..It's not difficult to see why investors might be getting twitchy. Faith in central bank independence is foundational in the modern financial system. That's because politically influenced monetary policy may be popular and stimulative in the short term but damaging in the long term..As former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said in 2010: ""Political interference in monetary policy can generate undesirable boom-bust cycles that ultimately lead to both a less stable economy and higher inflation."".What makes the situation especially dicey is that even though investors are highly aware of this risk, they can't truly price it in. The term premium has risen, but not anywhere close to where it would likely soar to if the Fed's independence were truly called into question. The risk is too monumental, and the range of potential outcomes is too broad..That's essentially what happened with the trade war. Tariffs were Trump's number one economic policy on the campaign trail, and he was elected on that platform. It's not for nothing that Trump referred to himself as ""Tariff Man."".Yet U.S. markets kept rising after his election, not necessarily because investors didn't believe Trump, but more likely because they simply had no clear way to price in the risk of an all-out global trade war. So even though investors knew ""Liberation Day"" was coming, markets still gyrated wildly after it arrived..The S&P 500 plunged 15%, wiping $6 trillion off the value of U.S. stocks in just three days. The long end of the U.S. bond market cratered too, triggering the 30-year yield's biggest weekly rise since 1982, and the dollar sank 3%..The slump in Treasuries and the dollar was particularly alarming, as they usually rise in times of financial, economic or political crisis. Gold and the Swiss franc had one of their best weeks in decades, but the U.S. ""safe havens"" tanked..This is a cautionary tale for markets as tensions rise between the White House and the Fed, especially U.S. markets. If Trump does remove Powell before his term ends in May next year, investors can't say they weren't warned. But it likely won't matter because the consequences are simply too big to price..What could move markets tomorrow?.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Will the damage done to Nvidia and others on Wednesday prompt a similar rethink?.Economic signals from China and the U.S. on Wednesday were surprisingly positive, withU.S. retail salesin March andfirst quarter Chinese GDP growthbeating forecasts. But these are rear-view mirror indicators, and if anyone needed it, Wednesday's news is a reminder that the outlook is pretty bleak..Economists at Morgan Stanley and UBS this week cut their Chinese 2025 GDP outlooks to 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively. Anything close to the UBS forecast would be particularly alarming for Beijing, which is targeting growth of around 5%..Morgan Stanley's economists estimate tariffs will knock 90 basis points off growth relative to their original forecast, which will only be partially offset by 60 bps of additional stimulus..Although U.S. growth is slowing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Wednesday the central bank will wait for ""greater clarity"" before deciding its next move on rates. He also said markets have been orderly and downplayed the risk of Fed intervention..Massive selling of long-dated Treasuries last week raised fears that part of the bond market wasn't functioning smoothly. There was no sign of that on Wednesday, however, as bonds' 'safe haven' qualities pushed yields down as much as 5 basis points at the short end..In Europe, eyes will turn to Frankfurt where theEuropean Central Bankon Thursday will announce its latest policy decision and ECB President Christine Lagarde will offer her outlook. Market pricing suggests a 25 basis point cut is all but certain, with at least another two coming later this year..And after Wednesday's rout, the focus in Asia on Thursday will stay on tech as Taiwan's TSMC reports first-quarter earnings. The world's largest contract chipmaker is expected to report a 34.2% increase in revenue to $25.318 billion from $18.87 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from five analysts based on LSEG data..Tech and tariffs - a potent mix which roiled markets on Wednesday and will likely do so again sooner rather than later..US Big Tech swaps 'safe haven' sheen for trade war target.Treasuries are not the only 'safe haven' U.S. asset getting the cold shoulder as investors around the world rethink their enthusiasm for all things America. The shadow over 'Big Tech' is darkening and lengthening too..In recent weeks, the global trade war, the Trump administration's 'America First' agenda and its apparent disdain for the post-war world order have dramatically slowed inflows into U.S. markets, and in some cases, reversed them. What used to be considered some of the safest shelters from crisis are now looking a little flimsy..It might seem a stretch to put shares of U.S. technology and chip companies, such as Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, on par with IOUs of the federal government, but these cash-generating emblems of 'U.S. exceptionalism' certainly seemed like sure things up until recently..As these firms' global dominance spread over the past decade and their market footprint reached an unprecedented size, they effectively become ATMs for shareholders, generating record profits running into the hundreds of billions of dollars..In the fourth quarter of last year, the 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla - accounted for a record 35% of the S&P 500's market cap, with a combined valuation of around $17.5 trillion. Credit ratings on some, like Apple, are the same as the U.S. sovereign rating, and yields have even traded below Treasury yields on occasion..Investors of all stripes wanted in, from domestic to foreign, retail to official..And who could blame them? The 'Mag 7' appeared to offer the best of both investment worlds: a high income-generating asset and a safe-haven. So much so that the Swiss National Bank has a quarter of its $150 billion equity holdings in Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, and half of the $1.8 trillion Norwegian wealth fund's record $222 billion profit last year came from U.S. tech..But that sweet spot is gone. The 'American exceptionalism' narrative has been undermined, as the U.S. economy looks set to slow and America's AI invincibility has been shattered by China's DeepSeek. And now tech companies find themselves on the front line of the global trade war..Washington is issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. Nvidia said it faces $5.5 billion in charges, and its shares tumbled 9% on Wednesday, wiping nearly $250 billion off its market value and dragging the broader semiconductor index down 4%..To be sure, U.S. tech has been getting slammed since mid-February, as investors have begun to re-evaluate the sunny outlook they had for the industry under a Trump presidency. The semiconductor index is now deep in a bear market. It has lost 30% in just two months and valuations have come down much more than the wider S&P 500..U.S. Big Tech is suddenly vulnerable on multiple fronts. Tariffs and trade restrictions from Washington will bite, as will retaliatory moves from China. And if Europe really wants to hit America where it hurts, tech is an obvious target..WHAT GOES UP....But it's also worth remembering how much Big Tech outperformed on the way up. They were - and remain - incredibly profitable. According to LSEG figures, the Mag 7's net profit margin hit a record 25.8% in the fourth quarter, nearly double the S&P 500's 13.4%..Nvidia's value rose 10-fold in two years to more than $3.5 trillion, Mag 7 stocks more than doubled between October 2023 and last December, and these companies accounted for almost all of the market's profit growth in 2023..While that halved last year and is expected to decline further this year to around a third, there is still a lot of air left to come out of the balloon. According to Bank of America's latest global fund manager survey, 'long Mag 7' was the most crowded trade for 23 consecutive months until April..And what was it replaced with? Long gold, one 'safe haven' that isn't giving up its title..What could move markets tomorrow?.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

2025-04-11,"Tittle:US still facing 1930s tariff shock, vice tightens around China
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, April 10 (Reuters) - With the dust now settled on the euphoric market rebound following President Donald Trump's trade war climb-down, investors are realizing that the global economy still faces the most punishing U.S. tariffs in nearly 100 years..The picture is marginally brighter than it was before Trump blinked at 1:18 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday and announced a 90-day hiatus and a reduction to 10% for most of his 'reciprocal' tariffs. Washington is now pursuing negotiations with its trading partners and most retaliatory measures have been put on ice..But the big picture remains pretty dim..Analysis published by the non-partisan Budget Lab at Yale on Thursday suggests U.S. consumers will face an overall average effective tariff rate of 25.3%, only ""slightly different"" from before Trump's pullback, and the highest since 1909. Even accounting for likely consumption shifts away from Chinese goods the average tariff rate will be 18.1%, the highest since 1934..""It's clear the U.S. economy hasn't seen a shock like this since the 1920s and 1930s,"" PIMCO economist Tiffany Wilding wrote on Thursday..She estimates that every percentage point increase in the average effective tariff rate shaves about 0.1 ppt off U.S. growth and adds a similar amount to inflation. She says U.S. recession is now likely, as is core inflation surging to 4.5%. That's a dismal picture..By some measures, the trade war's vice-like grip on the global economy has tightened, particularly because of the pain being inflicted on China..Essentially, any semblance of a truce in Trump's broad trade war is being offset by the ratcheting up of tensions with China. Levies on Chinese goods are now an eye-popping 145%, the White House on Thursday..As Pictet Wealth Management's Frederik Ducrozet notes, the global trade war narrowed on Wednesday, but it also deepened. A ""full decoupling"" between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, is playing out in front of our eyes..Little wonder that China's stock market significantly lagged its regional and global peers on Thursday, although eking out a 1.3% rise was an achievement given the increasingly alarming U.S.-China standoff..TD Securities strategist James Rossiter calculates that the import-weighted average U.S. tariff has actually risen to 26.2% from 23.9% on April 2, Trump's 'Liberation Day'. Of course, if U.S.-China trade collapses, as could happen if neither Washington or Beijing backs down, the average effective rate will be closer to the global 10%..But freezing the two-way flow of nearly $600 billion in annual trade isn't exactly bullish, as investors realize - in U.S. trading hours on Thursday stocks plunged again, and 'safe-havens' like the Swiss franc, gold and short-dated Treasuries surged..So what are China's options? Policymakers in Beijing were already facing an unenviable domestic situation - a real estate crash, deflation and moribund demand and investment - and Trump's belligerence can only make that more difficult..If the economic battle lines between the world's two economic superpowers are being marked by tariffs, the market battle lines are being drawn by the dollar/yuan exchange rate. In bright Technicolor, too..It's hard to envisage how China withstands or fights back against such punitive tariffs without a significant depreciation of its tightly controlled yuan, or perhaps a much bigger devaluation..The currency market is leaning heavily that way: onshore spot dollar/yuan is a whisker from levels last seen in December 2007; Thursday's central bank dollar/yuan fixing of 7.2092 yuan was the highest since September 2023; the offshore 'CNH' dollar/yuan rate touched a record peak of 7.4287 on Tuesday..Economists at Goldman Sachs on Thursday slashed their Chinese GDP growth forecasts to 4.0% this year and 3.5% next year from 4.5% and 4.0%, respectively. They also said that they expect ""significant"" monetary and fiscal policy easing from Beijing..No matter who blinks first in the coming months – Trump or President Xi Jinping – the rest of the global economy probably won't like what it sees..(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)"

Not only is that its biggest rise since the Swiss National Bank scrapped the franc's cap in January 2015, it's among the top 10 since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced more than 50 years ago..The euro rallied sharply too and German government bonds outperformed U.S. Treasuries, suggesting investors switching out of U.S. assets may be turning to Europe. There's a case to be made for it - there are few sufficiently liquid alternatives..Economic data and commentary fromcentral bank officialsare playing second fiddle to trade issues for investors right now, evidenced by figures on Thursday that showed asurprising fall in U.S. inflationin March. Treasury yields fell a bit, but not across the whole curve and not as much as one might expect with Wall Street falling so steeply..A solid 30-year bond auction - demand for the $22 billion sale was the strongest since November - failed to prevent long-dated yields from rising. Just as tariff fears haven't dissipated, nor haveconcerns over the long end of the U.S. Treasury curve..U.S. still facing 1930s tariff shock, vice tightens around China.With the dust now settled on the euphoric market rebound following President Donald Trump's trade war climb-down, investors are realizing that the global economy still faces the most punishing U.S. tariffs in nearly 100 years..The picture is marginally brighter than it was before Trump blinked at 1:18 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday and announced a 90-day hiatus and a reduction to 10% for most of his 'reciprocal' tariffs. Washington is now pursuing negotiations with its trading partners and most retaliatory measures have been put on ice..But the big picture remains pretty dim..Analysis published by the non-partisan Budget Lab at Yale on Thursday suggests U.S. consumers will face an overall average effective tariff rate of 25.3%, only ""slightly different"" from before Trump's pullback, and the highest since 1909. Even accounting for likely consumption shifts away from Chinese goods the average tariff rate will be 18.1%, the highest since 1934..""It's clear the U.S. economy hasn't seen a shock like this since the 1920s and 1930s,"" PIMCO economist Tiffany Wilding wrote on Thursday..She estimates that every percentage point increase in the average effective tariff rate shaves about 0.1 ppt off U.S. growth and adds a similar amount to inflation. She says U.S. recession is now likely, as is core inflation surging to 4.5%. That's a dismal picture..By some measures, the trade war's vice-like grip on the global economy has tightened, particularly because of the pain being inflicted on China..Essentially, any semblance of a truce in Trump's broad trade war is being offset by the ratcheting up of tensions with China. Levies on Chinese goods are now an eye-popping 145%, the White House on Thursday..As Pictet Wealth Management's Frederik Ducrozet notes, the global trade war narrowed on Wednesday, but it also deepened. A ""full decoupling"" between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, is playing out in front of our eyes..Little wonder that China's stock market significantly lagged its regional and global peers on Thursday, although eking out a 1.3% rise was an achievement given the increasingly alarming U.S.-China standoff..TD Securities strategist James Rossiter calculates that the import-weighted average U.S. tariff has actually risen to 26.2% from 23.9% on April 2, Trump's 'Liberation Day'. Of course, if U.S.-China trade collapses, as could happen if neither Washington or Beijing backs down, the average effective rate will be closer to the global 10%..But freezing the two-way flow of nearly $600 billion in annual trade isn't exactly bullish, as investors realize - in U.S. trading hours on Thursday stocks plunged again, and 'safe-havens' like the Swiss franc, gold and short-dated Treasuries surged..So what are China's options? Policymakers in Beijing were already facing an unenviable domestic situation - a real estate crash, deflation and moribund demand and investment - and Trump's belligerence can only make that more difficult..If the economic battle lines between the world's two economic superpowers are being marked by tariffs, the market battle lines are being drawn by the dollar/yuan exchange rate. In bright Technicolor, too..It's hard to envisage how China withstands or fights back against such punitive tariffs without a significant depreciation of its tightly controlled yuan, or perhaps a much bigger devaluation..The currency market is leaning heavily that way: onshore spot dollar/yuan is a whisker from levels last seen in December 2007; Thursday's central bank dollar/yuan fixing of 7.2092 yuan was the highest since September 2023; the offshore 'CNH' dollar/yuan rate touched a record peak of 7.4287 on Tuesday..Economists at Goldman Sachs on Thursday slashed their Chinese GDP growth forecasts to 4.0% this year and 3.5% next year from 4.5% and 4.0%, respectively. They also said that they expect ""significant"" monetary and fiscal policy easing from Beijing..No matter who blinks first in the coming months – Trump or President Xi Jinping – the rest of the global economy probably won't like what it sees..What could move markets tomorrow?.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Around the 4% level on the 10-year is a very important resistance level, and we have not breached it. We've bounced off it a few times, and so we're watching that very closely to determine whether the bond market is truly starting to worry and expect recession-like outcomes..""The bond market is not fully pricing in a recession yet - emphasize yet, as the bigger variable here, which is harder to calibrate, is inflation. And while we're expecting slower growth, perhaps meaningfully slower growth, the outlook for inflation is still unclear."".HANS MIKKELSEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CREDIT STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK, NY:.""We think these events create an environment of lower trade deficits, and thus lower capital account surpluses to be invested in US assets, including corporate bonds. They may also lead to efforts to diversify away from US assets for other reasons..""We prefer to remain defensively positioned in this period of high tariffs and still very elevated economic policy uncertainty..ROGER YANG, AUDIT PARTNER, BUILDING, CONSTRUCTION & REAL ESTATE, KPMG, LOS ANGELES:.""Tariffs are casting an expansive shadow of price uncertainty in commercial real estate and raising the possibilities of a domino effect of exasperating costs on already expensive projects..""The lending landscape is also feeling the pinch. Banks were loosening the reigns on lending standards, but the uncertainty introduced by tariffs and other factors like labor shortages can lead to tighter credit conditions. Both traditional financial institutions and private capital providers will have a more discerning eye as they scrutinize deals more closely, focusing on whether they pencil out financially."".PHIL BLANCATO, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, OSAIC, NEW YORK:.""It's a bit of an over-reaction. We've somehow forgotten the strength of the U.S. Economy coming into this. The selloff in oil is a tailwind to the U.S. consumer.

Then we have a potential recession, significantly higher prices. We've got a stagflationary environment. Those are all very dangerous moments.

However, there are concerns with the growth of our economy, inflation, trade wars, and real wars around the world. Not to mention, over the last 24 months, market performance has been overly concentrated in just a few stocks. All of these things should be cause for concern. So what can you do about it? Being diversified in quality stocks is very important right now. Also, having fixed income assets in your portfolio that tend to have an inverse relationship with stocks are a great strategy to weather the storms of volatile markets. And finally, make sure you have enough money in liquid cash reserves.”.HUGH GIMBER, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, LONDON:.""The market reaction makes it very clear that last night's announcement was worse than expected."".""They key question we're focused on is how and when policy volatility showing up in economic data might prompt a shift to a more moderate approach. (U.S.) labour market data tomorrow becomes even more important than normal, investors will be looking to understand how businesses are reflecting this uncertainty in their hiring plans."".""Geographical diversification is crucial. Coming into this year, there was this assumption that this administration would be brilliant for the U.S. economy and difficult for the rest of the world. It's increasingly evident this policy mix in the U.S. is more difficult for the U.S. itself...there is now ample opportunity to diversify globally and make sure that investors are not too exposed to this theme of U.S. exceptionalism which appears to have peaked."".KATHY JONES, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK:.""The problem is you do get some price pressures, but that being said, the Fed's going to respond to unemployment more than anything, so if we see a decline in the employment outlook, and/or a tightening in financial conditions, I really don't think they have much choice but to go ahead and cut rates. It doesn't solve everybody's problems. A couple of Fed rate cuts will not solve the problem inflicted by tariffs. It can mitigate it, but it can't solve it."".""The bottom line is none of this really makes sense so why are we in a trade war with Canada when we have a trade surplus with Canada outside of energy and we need their energy to keep the East Coast lit up, the lights on in New York? So this is not like a well thought out, sensible policy, in my view."".""You can count on a fair amount of volatility. My guess is there will be somebody who comes off of the administration and tries to paint a different, a softer picture of this, and we probably get a snap back, but until there's actually a change in the policy or evidence of real negotiations going on, the market's going to be under pressure."".OLIVER PURSCHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEALTHSPIRE ADVISORS, NEW YORK:.“I think it's somewhat of an overreaction. Investors are clearly concerned about retaliation by other governments that could lead to a global recession.”.“I think we need to wait and see how corporations and governments react. The risk is very much there, there's no doubt. But we've also learned just over the last couple of months by Donald Trump, on and off again tariffs are not unusual for him. So we'll have to see how long the tariffs stay in place.”.“It’s kind of portfolio management 101 not to react to news when markets are being volatile, which is what we're seeing today.”.“Bottom line is this none of this is good, but it doesn't mean that it's horrible.”.SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH, PENNSYLVANIA:.""The tariff announcement was much more dire than expected and as a result stocks are in a free fall which is due to the expected inflationary impact of these tariffs, as well as the pressure that would likely be pushed company profits, and we're also seeing that sector leadership is squarely in safe haven mode, with consumer staples, health care and utilities holding up the desk while consumer discretionary and tech in full retreat."".""I think that investors are opportunists and will look for such a decline as a potential reason to buy, because how frequently do you end up with a 4% decline in the S&P 500 and a 5.5% decline in the NASDAQ? So there's an old saying that stocks tend to pop after a drop, and I think that in the next couple of days, we could end up with a pop mainly because the President is a negotiator and we believe that in the end, the Trump administration will try to work with our trading partners and come down to the base case of a 10% tariff across."".MICHAEL REYNOLDS, VICE PRESIDENT OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, GLENMEDE, PHILADELPHIA:.""We're not at all surprised by the market reaction today. It's risk off. It's pretty indiscriminate. It's cross borders."".""The announcement yesterday I think was a little more aggressive than even some of the largest trade hawks would have expected."".""We're talking about a pretty significant regime change in how the U.S. approaches global trade. And when you have a regime change like this that happens suddenly, at the flip of a switch, it's going to happen in a couple days... it doesn't surprise us to see a relatively violent market reaction."".KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT, MONTVALE, NEW JERSEY:.""It really makes no sense. The amount of ‘savings’ we are going to get as a percentage of GDP, or a percentage of the national debt, while losing trillions in market cap and possibly pushing us into a recession within a few months might be the worst trade-off in economic history. Without even looking, we know that this selloff and its velocity pushing us close to bear market territory from the highs, at least for the Nasdaq(-17.2% currently), must be just second to the velocity of the Covid selloff."".""If you are keeping score of where capital is flowing around the world it is certainly out of US markets, as we are down double digits from highs, meanwhile in China and Germany for example, they are up double digits. So someone has wrong here and someone has it right, and markets are never wrong."".""We can expect some pre-announcements this earnings season, as what guidance can a company really give in this scenario when things are looking so dire. Even before tariffs were actually set in stone, we heard from companies like Walmart and Delta for example that we remember, that they were already seeing a slowdown as the tariff talk just started so we can only imagine what they are going to say now."".""Trump, and maybe it is intentional as some believe, is boxing in the Fed. We have tariffs now, and even before that, as Powell hinted at during the last Fed day, signs of stagflation. We have seen people going crazy on Twitter/X calling for an emergency rate cut today which we think is way out of line."".DHAVAL JOSHI, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BCA RESEARCH, LONDON:.""The sell-off has been concentrated in AI stocks. The connection between the stock market sell-off and tariffs is not direct. Because if it was a direct connection, then you know, for example, retailers should be doing really badly. So what this is telling me is that this is like a sort of excuse or a catalyst for selling stocks which are really expensive. It was an expensive part of the market and it just needed a catalyst for the sell-off to start and that's what's happened. Even though there's no direct connection."".LEE HARDMAN, SENIOR CURRENCY ANALYST, MUFG, LONDON:.""From the dollar perspective, more broadly, initially we did see the dollar weaken across the board. The market initially is focusing on the negative implications for the U.S. economy more from these tariffs. It increases the risk of the U.S. slowing more and the Fed having to be more active in terms of cutting rates, despite higher inflation because of the tariffs. We would question how sustainable that sell-off in the dollar will be. If global growth is hit harder by these tariffs, then at some point we would expect the dollar to bounce back and to strengthen in that scenario."".‍SANDRA EBNER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, UNION INVESTMENT, FRANKFURT:.""We assume that the tariffs will not remain in place in the announced range, but will instead be a starting point for further negotiations. Trump has set a maximum demand from which the level of tariffs should decrease. However, it is already clear that the White House is targeting the EU and China in particular, while Mexico and Canada tend to be excluded from the trade barriers. In the past, many companies have emphasized that it is not so much the tariffs themselves that are a burden, but rather the uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy."".""At least that is now off the table. Since the measures would not affect all regions and sectors equally, there will be winners and losers as in 2018 – although the losers are more likely to be in the EU than in North America. To protect companies in Europe from the effects of tariffs, the EU should not respond with high counter-tariffs. In any case, their impact in the U.S. is not likely to be significant. It would be more efficient to provide targeted support to EU companies in the form of investment and stimulus."".NICHOLAS REES, HEAD OF MACRO RESEARCH, MONEX EUROPE, LONDON:.""Today for us, it's all going to be about watching the fallout from last night's announcement."".""Specifically, I'm looking at China and the eurozone. If there's a significant retaliation from China, that will be interesting. And it'll be interesting to see whether this involves dumping, because then you'll likely see ...tariffs on China go up. And at that point, we're looking at a rise in tariff barriers, not just from the U.S. and the rest of the world, but a rise in tariff barriers across the board."".JESSICA HENRY, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR FOR EQUITIES, FEDERATED HERMES LIMITED, LONDON:.""While Trump’s tariff announcements provided European markets with some degree of clarity, a key concern is that tariff uncertainty continues with retaliatory tariffs from the EU, UK and other regions expected to unfold in the coming days, and further announcements likely to be made from the U.S.."".""Prolonged uncertainty will likely cause ripple effects through global markets, further eroding investor confidence which has dwindled of late, particularly in relation to the Magnificent Seven."".DOMINIC BUNNING, HEAD OF G10 FX STRATEGY, NOMURA, LONDON:.""I think that the negative growth shock this seems to be implying for the U.S. is going to keep weighing on the dollar as investors think about whether to continue with the U.S. exceptionalism theme."".""There have been sizable flows from Europe to the U.S. (of around 500 billion euros in the last 12 months, according to the US TIC data) which could reverse to some extent."".""Obviously we need to see whether there are more tit-for-tat tariffs and retaliation, but the overarching theme to me is that European growth expectations have been basing, while U.S. expectations have rolled over and have further to run which can weigh on the USD against G10 FX in general."".JUSTIN ONUEKWUSI, CIO, ST JAMES'S PLACE, LONDON:.""Whilst still uncertain, we will likely see retaliation from Europe but it's clear countries will think about how to retaliate in a politically astute way."".""Significant retaliation could lead to a tariff 'spiral of doom' that could be the growth shock that drags us into recession."".""Germany has its biggest fiscal expansion since reunification but exporters and industrials in particular will be challenged buy U.S. tariffs."".""Still European equities are cheap and there is more significantly more upside."".""We have raised global recession risks to 35% from 15%."".""The volatility in markets, is likely to create opportunities for investors that are willing to be patient."".FREDERIQUE CARRIER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT, LONDON:.""The U.S. tariffs on the UK are less severe than those imposed on Europe, at 10%, a welcome relief to the UK government. However, the UK was not spared the 25% tariff imposed on all foreign autos, which will disappoint. The strategy to hold quiet negotiations ahead of the announcement doesn’t seem to have paid off so far."".""The tariffs serve as a stark reminder that the highly sought after free trade agreement with the US – once a key goal of the Brexit agenda – remains out of reach."".KASPER ELMGREEN, CIO OF FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES, NORDEA ASSET MANAGEMENT, COPENHAGEN:.""These tariffs are worse than expected, as shown by equities trading significantly down and gold and bonds trading up. Clearly, the reading here is that the recession risk is on the rise. This is a very clear signal, if anyone should be uncertain that globalisation has reversed, this is the signifier. We were in a period of high policy uncertainty, this is also why the initial excitement after the election abated so much. This announcement does not reduce uncertainty, but it is just step one in a process. We should expect now to see countermeasures and retaliations."".""One potential positive outcome is this is a shock to the system and it stabilises, this is a negotiation, a tactic to reset what is seen as an unfair system. That could create some kind of certainty. The negative view is that this does not create any certainty and there is a prolonged period of negotiations, hitting growth."".MAARTJE WIJFFELAARS, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT RABOBANK, EINDHOVEN:.""The tariffs on EU goods soften EU growth and raises EU inflation somewhat, but won’t to push the EU in a recession..What is important for the EU outlook is what will happen due to the broadscale tariffs with overall US demand, global demand and supply chains, how the EU will respond, and obviously investment decisions..The latter are likely to be delayed due to the uncertainty, but the extent to which is impossible to predict. We know from previous crises episodes that investments can shrink quickly – and the same goes for recovery by the way."".LYNN SONG, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR GREATER CHINA, ING, HONG KONG:.""The tariff hike was larger than what most market participants were expecting, so the initial market is likely going to be a continuation of risk off sentiment, reflecting weaker growth expectations on a macro level as well as the individually impacted companies on a micro level..""However, lost in the initial panic are several key things to consider. First, the U.S. has signalled that these reciprocal tariffs will mark a cap unless countries choose to retaliate, and they appear to be encouraging countries to come and negotiate to lower the rates. Second, a broad based global tariff means that substitution products are less available..""It feels like this time around US importers could end up bearing more of the burden from tariffs rather than expecting exporters to make up for the gap by cutting margins."".RODRIGO CATRIL, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK, SYDNEY:.""When you look at the tariff announcement, it's certainly bigger and larger than the base case for many, or most, so it's not surprising to see how the kiwi and the Aussie are the ones underperforming today, reflecting their pro-growth sensitivity, and of course an increase in tariffs does mean lower trade and lower global growth..""For the euro, it's an interesting one in the sense that it's showing some resilience, and that's probably related to the fact that Europe appears to be more focused on supporting its economy from the impact from U.S. tariffs, rather than looking to retaliate as a first initiative. So I think the market has liked that approach of calmness and measuredness from Europe."".WANG ZHUO, PARTNER, ZHOUZHU INVESTMENT, SHANGHAI:.""Trump's new tariff measures are undoubtedly unwise, as fair trade is not realized through so-called reciprocal taxes, but is determined by comparative advantage..""The higher tariffs will dent U.S. efforts to reduce inflation, so it's possible the U.S. will witness stagflation. The slump in U.S. stocks is a sign that investors are voting with their feet..""The Chinese market is fully prepared psychologically, so is resilient. What's more important for China now, is to pay attention to domestic macro policies and data, and see when our CPI data can improve and whether it's sustainable."""
2025-04-04,"Tittle:Trading Day: Trump is on fire, global markets tariffied
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, April 3 (Reuters) - Highest U.S. tariffs in over 100 years slam markets.On March 7, U.S. Treasury Scott Bessent said the U.S. economy could be in for a""detox period""as it adjusted to President Donald Trump's transformative policy agenda. The gyrations on Wall Street and beyond on April 3 followingTrump's sweeping global tariffsthe day before suggest that may be a huge understatement..U.S. stocks, thedollarandoilcratered on Thursday, bond yields plunged and volatility soared, as Trump's tariffs at a stroke darkened the near-term outlook for spending, investment, corporate earnings, economic activity and growth..Trump's tariffs on China are among the highest.Will Beijing risk devaluing the yuan?See below for more, but first, a round up of today's remarkable moves on world markets..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments atjamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com, opens new tab. You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social..Today's Key Market Moves.Trump is on fire, global markets tariffied.One should never read too much into a single day's trading in financial markets, but some days are so dramatic it's difficult not to. Thursday is one of them..Declines of more than 4% on Wall Street and near-2% swings in the dollar don't come around too often, and outside of major crises like the Global Financial Crisis or the pandemic, they are even rarer..So it is a measure of investors' shock at the severity of Trump's tariffs, trepidation overthe damage they'll inflict- and, no little disbelief athow they were calculated- that markets gyrated as much as they did on Thursday..Economist David Beckworth posted on social media platform X that Trump's latest salvo in his global trade war may be ""one of the biggest unforced economic policy errors in US history"" - a bold claim, perhaps, but one which seems to be resonating..Analysts are ratcheting down their U.S. growth forecasts, and sub-1% expansion this year is now in view, while recession risks have risen sharply. Rates traders are now pricing in almost 100 basis points of Fed cuts this year and 150 bps by the middle of next year..As economist Rebecca Harding states, ""nobody wins from the trade war."" It's a simple but important point - the economic and market outlook everywhere is suddenly bleaker, especially in some of theAsian countriesthat have been hit with the heaviest duties..What's more,policymakersfind themselves in an even tighter spot. Will theBank of Japanbe so keen to continue with its rate-hiking campaign? Will theEuropean Central BankorBank of Englandbe forced to cut rates more than planned if the euro and sterling continue rising? And how doespowerhouse Chinarespond?.Part of the problem for everyone - investors, households, businesses and policymakers - is Trump's propensity to change course in the blink of an eye. Some tariffs may be lowered, exempted, or postponed within days, should countries come to the negotiating table and strike a deal with ""Tariff Man""..Of course if they are maintained, orcountries retaliate, the economic and market outlook could darken even more, stoking volatility and uncertainty - good for gold, bonds and short sellers; not so good for stocks, credit and other risky assets..If investors are hoping a sense of calm might descend on markets on Friday, think again - the latest U.S. payrolls will be released at 8:30 ET, and a few hours later Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers a speech on the economic outlook..Stock futures around the world are pointing to heavy losses at the open. Buckle up..What next in world trade war? Watch the yuan.What's the most important exchange rate in the world right now? Probably dollar/yuan..How Beijing responds to the eye-popping tariffs the Trump administration slapped on Chinese exports to the U.S. will be critical not only for China, but also for its 'plus one' trading partners in Asia, and world markets more broadly..The total tariff rate on U.S. imported goods from China is now a whopping 54%. If maintained for a reasonable length of time, this will be a financial hit to Beijing that will likely hinder its efforts to address its lingering real estate crisis, boost consumption, build its military might, and fund its myriad investments..And, unlike in the first Trump trade war, China can't rely on funneling exports and investment through 'plus one' countries in Asia to mitigate the tariff shock because those nations have also been hit with punitive levies. In some cases, like Vietnam, the tariffs are even higher than China's..That leaves currency devaluation as perhaps the most powerful weapon China can wield as it looks to respond to Washington's latest salvo. But unfortunately for Beijing, that strategy is fraught with risk..A rapid fall in the yuan's value could trigger huge capital flight as international and domestic investors pull money out of the country, slamming domestic asset prices and stoking financial market volatility..And beyond China's borders, a tumbling yuan could force other Asian countries to let their currencies fall in order to maintain competitiveness, potentially sparking a 'beggar-thy-neighbor' FX devaluation war, the last thing any of them need..Moreover, currency devaluation runs counter to the sweep of reforms and stimulus measures Beijing has announced since September, as it seeks to reflate the economy via domestic consumption rather than exports..And China's room for further policy stimulus is already fading. Further interest rate cuts and liquidity provisions will probably come, but a major fiscal boost will involve issuing more bonds, which will strain an already widening budget deficit..Indeed, Fitch downgraded China's credit rating on Thursday by one notch to 'A', citing a deterioration in the public finances as Beijing scrambles to shore up tariff-hit growth..""Everything now depends on China,"" says Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, warning that a meaningful devaluation of the yuan could begin a global 'risk-off' downward spiral that could slam emerging markets and, if it persists, tank the U.S. economy as well..Beijing has previously said it won't go down the FX depreciation road, preferring to keep the yuan relatively ""stable"". But that was before Trump's self-styled ""Liberation Day""..Beijing's first response might be to try and negotiate with Washington to get the tariffs lowered. But if that fails, FX devaluation becomes a real option to offset the shock..Analysts at Goldman Sachs are among those who believe China will continue to resist ""significant"" FX depreciation, but they note that the combined impact of all the U.S. tariffs on China announced since Trump's inauguration in January could take a 1.7 percentage point bite out of China's annual growth rate. That's huge..What do the FX markets think? You should never read too much into one day's moves. But it's worth noting that dollar/yuan on Thursday clocked its biggest spot market rise in five months, and the People's Bank of China allowed the yuan to depreciate the most in four months at the daily fixing..Moving forward, the big level to watch for spot dollar/yuan is 7.35, and 7.25 for the central bank's daily fixing. Breaking through those would leave the yuan at its weakest point against the U.S. dollar since the depths of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2008..The yuan isn't too far away from these levels right now. The world is watching..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Article:.LONDON/TOKYO, April 3 (Reuters) - The latest round ofU.S. trade tariffsunveiled on Wednesday will sap yet more vigour from a world economy barely recovered from the post-pandemic inflation surge, weighed down by record debt and unnerved by geopolitical strife..Depending on how PresidentDonald Trumpand leaders of other nations proceed now, it may also go down as a turning point for a globalised system that until now had taken for granted the strength and reliability of America, its largest component..""Trump's tariffs carry the risk of destroying the global free trade order the United States itself has spear-headed since the Second World War,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute..But in coming months it will be the plain and simple price-hiking - and therefore demand-dampening - effects of new levies applied to thousands of goods bought and sold by consumers and businesses across the planet that will prevail..""I see it as a drift of the U.S. and global economy towards worse performance, more uncertainty and possibly heading towards something we could call a global recession,"" said Antonio Fatas, macroeconomist at the INSEAD business school in France..Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump said he wouldimposea 10% baseline tariff on all imports and held up a chart showing higher duties on some of the country's biggest trading partners, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union..A 25% auto and auto parts tariff wasconfirmedearlier. Trump said the tariffs would return strategically vital manufacturing capabilities to the United States..Under the new global levies imposed by Trump, the U.S. tariff rate on all imports jumped to 22% - a rate last seen around 1910 - from just 2.5% in 2024, said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research atFitch Ratings..""This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy,"" Sonola said.

She added the Fund expected shortly to make a small downward ""correction"" to its 2025 forecast of 3.3% global growth..But the impact on national economies is set to diverge widely, given the spectrum of tariffs ranging from 10% for Britain to 49% for Cambodia..If the result is a wider trade war, that would have even larger repercussions for producers like China, which would be left hunting for new markets in the face of weak domestic consumption..""Asian economies will be hit harder than most by U.S. reciprocal tariffs,"" said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics. ""Not only do Asian economies face higher tariffs than many others, they are also more dependent on U.S. goods demand than most."".If the tariffs push the U.S. itself towards recession, that will weigh heavily on developing countries whose fortunes are closely tied to those of the world's largest economy..Stocks dived and investors scrambled to the safety of bonds, gold and the yen on Thursday on heightened economic worries..The knock-on effects for central banks and governments are also potentially large..An unravelling of supply chains that for years kept a lid on prices for consumers could lead to a world in which inflation tends to run ""hotter"" than the 2%, which central bankers currently agree is a manageable target..That would complicate decisions for the Bank of Japan, which may face pressure to combat inflation with more rate hikes just as its major counterparts eye cuts, and as its export sector takes a hit from U.S. duties..But there is little countries can do beyond mitigating the economic hit and asking Washington for exemptions. Auto exportersJapan, hit with a 24% reciprocal tariff rate, andSouth Korea, which was imposed a 25% rate, have signalled plans to take emergency measures to support affected businesses..Despite being U.S. allies, both countries were singled out by Trump as the worst offenders of unfair trade practices..Japan'strade ministerwarned the U.S. levies could violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but said only that Tokyo will consider ""various options"" on how to respond. ""Given its strong national security ties with the United States, Japan has no cards to play to win concessions,"" said Nomura's Kiuchi..Australia'sprime minister criticised the tariffs as not ""the act of a friend"" but ruled out reciprocal measures..Weak economic output will leave some governments struggling even more to pay down the world'srecord$318 trillion debt load and find money for budget priorities such as defence, climate action and welfare..And what if the tariffs do not bring about Trump's aim of private sector investment in domestic U.S. manufacturing, given the domestic labour shortages already facing a country with close to full employment?.Some see him seeking other ways to remove the U.S. global trade deficit that riles him so much - for example by demanding others join in a re-balancing of foreign exchange rates to benefit U.S. exporters..""We are going to continue to see him putting out there potentially more risky ways of dealing with the continuous strength of the dollar,"" said Freya Beamish, chief economist at investment strategy firm TS Lombard..Such moves could jeopardise the privileged position of the dollar as the world reserve currency of choice - an outcome few predict, if only because there are no real alternatives to the dollar..Nonetheless, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Wednesday told an event in Ireland that Europe needed to act now and accelerate economic reforms to compete in what she called an ""inverted world""..""Everyone benefited from a hegemon, the United States, that was committed to a multilateral, rules-based order,"" she said of the post-Cold War era of low inflation and growing trade in an open global economy..""Today we must contend with closure, fragmentation and uncertainty."""

Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, April 2 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY.Making sense of the forces driving global markets.By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist.New reality about to dawn.U.S. markets on Wednesday were determined to put on a brave face ahead ofU.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffsthat will escalate a global trade war and threaten to upend the entire international trading system..Stocks rose sharply and Treasuries andthe dollarended notably weaker. Buoyed by hope or expectation that the tariffs wouldn't be as draconian as feared,U.S. indices closed in the green. The deeper analysis of the tariff fallout - lower growth and higher inflation - will be for tomorrow and beyond..Fed policymakers and other central bankers are in a bind - do they respond to the weaker growth impulse, or higher inflation?More on that below, but first, a round up of today's main market moves..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com. You can also follow me at@ReutersJamie, opens new taband@reutersjamie.bsky.social, opens new tab..Today's Key Market Moves.T-Day arrives, markets rise.So, 'Tariff Man' has shown his hand, and now markets nervously await the response from the rest of the world. Most countries will probably play their cards cautiously and carefully, which is whatBritain's finance minister Rachel ReevesandMexican President Claudia Sheinbaumon Wednesday indicated they will do..Trump's tariff salvo adds to the long list of protectionist shots fired since his inauguration in January. The extent of the pain and damage remains to be seen, and earlier on Wednesday European Central Bank PresidentChristine Lagardesaid it will be ""negative the world over"" whileBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Uedasaid the hit to global trade could be huge..Few would argue, although the latest global readout points to a mixed picture in the first quarter as economies grappled with historically high levels of uncertainty and braced for impact -factory activity in Indiaexpanded at the fastest pace in eight months, whileindustrial production in Brazilunexpectedly fell;Mexico's governmenton Tuesday lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecast, but to a still rosy 1.5%-2.3%..The most recent U.S. economic indicators suggest activity and the labor market have held up pretty well ahead of ""T-Day"" - durable goods orders rose solidly in February and ADP private sector payrolls growth in March beat expectations..Although the economist consensus is still for GDP expansion in the first quarter and beyond, forecasts are being cut across the board - JP Morgan's Michael Feroli, for example, slashed his Q1 forecast to 0.0% from 1.0% and his 2025 call to 1.3% from 1.6%..Still, these and most forecasts are significantly brighter than the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model's gloomy estimate of 1.4% GDP contraction in the first quarter when adjusted for outsized gold imports..Thursday is the first day in the new world of Trump's tariffs, and there's huge uncertainty and risk for investors to navigate. Let's see if their optimism from the previous day spills over..Optimal Fed response to tariffs? Ease policy.Focus on the ""stag"". Ride out the ""flation"". That may be the Federal Reserve's optimal plan for handling the new wave of tariffs coming from the Trump administration..With details of U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs now emerging, all eyes will soon turn to the Fed's and other central banks' response to the president's ""liberation day"" duties that could leave them in quite a bind..It's generally agreed that tariffs are damaging to growth and inflationary, initially at least. So how should central bankers react? Do they cut interest rates to prop up a stagnating economy or raise them to cool fiery price pressures?.According to aMinneapolis Fed working paper, opens new tabpublished last month, the answer is clearly the former. The authors find that the ""optimal"" policy response to tariffs is not just to look through the inflationary impact and keep rates steady, but to go even further and ease policy..""The optimal monetary response is to stimulate the economy, raising aggregate income and boosting demand for imported goods,"" wrote Minneapolis Fed economist Javier Bianchi and University of Wisconsin-Madison assistant professor Louphou Coulibaly..The optimal response, they argue, ""is expansionary, letting inflation rise above and beyond the direct effects of tariffs. This result holds regardless of whether tariffs apply to consumption goods or intermediate inputs, whether the shock is temporary or permanent."".This all runs counter to the commonly held belief that pouring fuel on an inflationary fire is essentially the most dangerous thing a central banker can do, as it risks ""unanchoring"" inflation expectations..But the authors argue that history simply doesn't show this to be the case. Instead, the data suggests that to mitigate the slump in imports as tariffs bite, the central bank must stimulate economic activity, lift employment and boost income. Policymakers must be prepared to ""tolerate some overheating,"" the authors contend..This conclusion reflects another important lesson from economic history: tariffs are pretty bad for growth..A 2020 study using aggregated data for 151 countries, opens new tabfrom 1963 through 2014 found that tariffs have ""economically- and statistically-significant adverse effects"" on growth..The impact is ""persistent"" and increases over time, the researchers found. Their baseline model suggests that a 3.6 percentage points increase in tariffs results in a 0.4% decline in economic output five years later..They actually found that the projected longer-term effect of tariffs on GDP was higher than the estimated medium-term impacts, but they limited their study to a five-year time horizon ""in an effort to be conservative."".Right now, Fed officials are also erring on the side of caution. In their revised economic projections released last month, they maintained their forecast for two quarter-point rate cuts this year, although a hawkish underlying shift in the ""dot plot"" of officials' individual projections moved the median closer to one cut..And Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been at pains to be neutral and non-committal on the question of tariffs, insisting that, before acting, he and his colleagues must wait and see what the actual impact is on activity, prices and employment..Fed Governor Chris Waller, however, was a bit bolder in a speech to the OECD in Paris in January, stating: ""If, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view of appropriate monetary policy."".The market is certainly focusing on the ""stag"" more than the ""flation"".

2025-04-02,"Tittle:Trading Day: Nervous calm ahead of 'Liberation Day'
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, April 2 (Reuters) - Only 24 hours until Trump unveils new tariffs.The first trading day of the quarter on Tuesday was a nervy affair ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" on Wednesday, with markets struggling for clear direction as Trump's new trade barriers loomed into view..Stocks mostly rosebut U.S. Treasury yields tumbled, whilegoldandthe dollarbroadly held steady. Talking of the greenback, I will dig deeper intothe IMF's latest FX reserves databelow, but first, here are the scores on the doors from Tuesday's trading around the world..Today's Key Market Moves..The specter of Trump's new tariffs on Wednesday has sucked the oxygen out of world markets in recent weeks, and despite the generally positive performance on Tuesday, anyone hoping life will be injected back into them once the announcement is made is setting themselves up for disappointment..There's simply too much uncertainty and too little visibility around how the new tariffs will work, how long they will be in place, what exemptions or concessions there may be,how other countries will react, and what the implications will be for specific sectors, markets and asset classes..To paraphrase former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, that's a lot of known unknowns, and a fair sprinkling of unknown unknowns too. That fog of uncertainty won't lift on Wednesday, and indeed, is more likely to thicken - hardly the conducive environment for investors, consumers andbusinessesto get spending..An announcement has been scheduled for 4 p.m. Eastern Time (2000 GMT) on Wednesday, and it wouldn't be surprising if investors try to maintain a holding pattern across markets until then as best they can..The longer termdilemma they and policymakers facewas encapsulated ina couple of U.S. economic indicators on Tuesdaythat showed manufacturing slipping back into contraction, and a measure of factory gate inflation jumping to the highest in nearly three years..Stagflation risks are rising, markets are skittish, and the common denominator is Trump's tariff agenda..Japanese stock futures point to the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rising around 0.4% at the open on Wednesday, a pretty small bounce considering the index had plunged 4% on Monday..Dollar's record low FX reserves share not all bad news for Trump.In January, U.S. President Donald Trump warned the so-called BRICS nations against replacing, or backing any currency to take the place of, the ""mighty U.S. dollar."".While the International Monetary Fund's latest foreign exchange reserves data for the fourth quarter of last year suggests central banks around the world continue to pull away from the greenback, there may be a silver lining for the president..The IMF's Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (Cofer) data, the gold standard for FX reserves information, show that countries have been gradually chipping away at their dollar holdings and diversifying for years..Indeed, the greenback's nominal share of official FX reserve holdings in the third quarter of last year fell to a record low 57.3% from over 72.0% in 2001..That crept up slightly to 57.8% in the fourth quarter, a rare rise, but the dollar surged 7.6% against a basket of major currencies in the period, its biggest quarterly appreciation in nearly a decade. All else equal, this reduces the dollar value of reserves held in non-dollar currencies such as the euro, sterling, or Japanese yen..When adjusting for these FX changes, the dollar's share of reserves slid to a record low of 54.1% from 55.3%, according to Goldman Sachs. At the start of the millennium, that share was over 71%..Importantly, the Cofer figures only go up to December 31, so do not take into account any reserve shifts made amid the historically high policy uncertainty and market ructions of recent months..With military, diplomatic and trade ties going back decades now fraying at an alarming rate, reserve managers are bound to be rethinking their FX allocations. And that is unlikely to involve a sudden re-discovered love for the dollar..Reserve managers do not typically make knee-jerk reactions to market gyrations or the headlines du jour. They're a cautious breed, prioritizing liquidity, stability and long-termism over yield, opportunity and a fast buck..But further diversification of their FX reserves can hardly be considered an impulsive reaction, as the trend is pretty well entrenched. The emergence of any new world order in the coming years would likely only strengthen it..No matter how you slice it, the dollar's overwhelming dominance in global FX reserves is weakening. But that doesn't mean the greenback's place as the world's preeminent reserve currency is under threat..Its share is not being eaten up by its nearest rival, the euro, but by a bunch of smaller, ""nontraditional"" reserve currencies such as the Korean won, Australian and Canadian dollars, and China's renminbi..""It's not just diversification out of the dollar. Euro reserve holdings have fallen in nominal and valuation-adjusted terms as well,"" notes Goldman's Michael Cahill..This is a trend that has been underway for years, taking hold just after the Global Financial Crisis and accelerating again after the pandemic..The Cofer data shows the aggregate share of ""nontraditional"" currencies in central banks' FX reserves was 12.6% in December, just off September's record high of 12.7%. Before 2009, that share had never exceeded 3%..The euro's share since its launch more than 25 years ago has never fallen below 19% and only once, in late 2020, has it exceeded 21%. Any reduction in the difference between the dollar and euro shares has been caused by reserve managers shunning the greenback rather than taking a shine to the euro..Their preference to build up holdings of several smaller currencies has created a somewhat curious equilibrium. The dollar is seeing its dominance gradually diminish, but it's in little danger of losing its role as the world's sole reserve currency..Trump, who seems to want the dollar to remain dominant while no longer sucking in so much of the world's savings, may be happy with that..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com.

You can also follow me at@ReutersJamie, opens new taband@reutersjamie.bsky.social, opens new tab..Today's Key Market Moves.Investors find automotive for caution.Trump's latest tariff salvo drewwidespread international criticismand weighed heavily on global markets on Thursday..It's not just tariffs grabbing U.S. equity traders' attention as the end of the quarter approaches - the S&P 500 is hovering around a key long-term trend line that technical analysts say could help determine the market's fate in the coming weeks and months..The index is trading just below the 200-day moving average, having traded above for most of the last two years, during which time the market rose more than 50%. Failure to leap back above this technical level will be seen as a bearish sign..""Nothing good happens below the 200-day moving average,"" a quote attributed to billionaire veteran hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, is getting a lot of play right now..If the flip side of that is nothing bad happens above the 200-day moving average, look no further than gold, which rose again to a new high on Thursday. Gold has traded above its 200-day moving average every day since 17 October, 2023, and appears to be accelerating further above it..Of course,there's more driving gold higher than just technicals. Fundamental factors like concerns around inflation, growth, and geopolitics are fueling demand and driving momentum. Tariffs and global trade tensions are part of that too..The uncertainty is also beginningto affect the U.S. corporate earnings outlook. While figures on Thursday showed that corporate profits surged toa record high in the fourth quarter, analysts are lowering their forecasts for this year..Analysts at Citi estimate that a 10% increase in tariffs roughly equates to a 5%-6% decline in U.S. earnings per share, and Barclays analysts this week lowered their S&P 500 base case EPS estimate to $262 this year from $271..A lot can change between now and April 3, when the auto tariffs are set to kick in. Trump could scrap them entirely just as easily as he could increase them, so the uncertainty and lack of visibility will likely keep investors on the defensive..Perhaps one surprising element of Trump's auto tariffs is how well the currencies of the key targeted countries have stood up. Can this resilience last?.Auto tariff FX pain is hitting close to home.While auto company shares around the world are wilting following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to slap aggressive tariffs on imported cars, the currencies of the most-affected countries are holding up surprisingly well..Trump said on Wednesday that a 25% tariff on imported vehicles will take effect on April 3. There will be some delays and exemptions, of course, but this could potentially add another $55 billion to the cost of finished vehicles..The United States imported $220 billion of finished cars and vehicles last year, of which 22% came from Mexico, 18% from Japan, 17% from Korea, 13% from Canada and 11% from Germany. Imports of all auto products totaled $474 billion..Given these figures, the reaction of equity markets on Thursday was unsurprising: shares of South Korea's Hyundai fell 4.3%, roughly three times more than the broader KOSPI's loss, and some $16 billion was wiped off Japan's transport index..German auto shares fell too, extending their losses to 10% over the last three weeks, a period in which the broader DAX has flat lined. Analysts at Morgan Stanley expect shares in ""all exposed"" European auto companies to fall a further 5-7% in the near term..But the FX market's reaction was mixed. The Mexican peso fell 1%, and both the yen and Canadian dollar slipped around 0.3%. But the euro and South Korean won rose 0.3%..Indeed, the currencies of the four largest auto-exporters to the U.S. - Mexico, Japan, Canada and South Korea - are all stronger against the U.S. dollar so far this year. And with the exception of the Korean won, they are also all up since Trump's inauguration on January 20..The euro is obviously a special case because it is shared by 20 countries and has been propelled higher in recent weeks by Germany's fiscal pivot. Regardless, the euro is also firmer against the greenback this year..On the face of it, this is a head-scratcher. The hit to these economies will be significant if the proposed tariffs are fully implemented and kept in place for some time..But zoom out a little further, and a clearer picture emerges: one of U.S. dollar weakness..While the 'Tariff Man's' protectionist trade agenda could have positive benefits for the U.S. economy over the long term, the short-term impact is clearly negative. The tariff talk is damaging U.S. consumer and business confidence, and market sentiment, much more than these threats are hurting other economies..And U.S. consumers have reason to be skittish..Morgan Stanley estimates that, all else being equal, the 25% tariff on auto imports equates to a price increase of more than $90 billion across the industry, or nearly $6,000 per unit on average. Arthur Wheaton, director at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, reckons vehicle prices could shoot up by as much as $20,000..For a country that uses and loves cars as much as America, that would be extremely painful..Trump's tariffs also appear to be one reason overseas investors are reassessing their U.S. assets. Foreign investors are reducing exposure to Uncle Sam for economic, political and valuation reasons. And non-dollar currencies are benefiting in turn..""It's mostly a capital flight story. The tariffs are bad for Canada, Mexico and other countries, but investors are also fleeing U.S. assets,"" says Brent Donnelly, president of trading and analytics firm Spectra Markets..The auto exporters' currencies aren't immune to the escalating trade war. The Canadian dollar slumped to a four-and-a-half-year low last month, and the peso could well come under more pressure due to the auto sector's relatively large footprint in Mexico's economy..But right now, the currency feeling the whiplash most from Trump's tariffs may be the U.S. dollar..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..Opinions expressed are those of the author.

I'll dig into broader U.S. capital flows trends below, but first, a round-up of Monday's markets..Today's Key Market Moves..Trade war fears haven't dissipated completely and the situation remains extremely fluid. While Trump said on Monday he may give a ""lot of countries"" breaks on tariffs, he still plans to announce more in the next few days on cars, and then on lumber and chips further down the line..And any hopes of inflation relief from less of a blanket approach to tariffs from Washington may be tempered by another rise in oil prices after Trump said he willimpose a 25% tariff on countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela..The price of Brent and WTI crude futures rose more than 1% on Monday to the highest in three weeks.That was the fourth daily increase in a row..If Monday was a slightly more optimistic day for investors regarding global trade tensions, it was less encouraging on the interest rate front..Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bosticsaid on Monday he now only sees the central bank delivering one quarter percentage point rate cut this year because he expects inflation won't come down as quickly as hoped..Bostic had previously expected the Fed would cut rates twice this year. That remains the median view across the Fed's 19 policymaking officials as last week's revised projections showed, but the underlying weight of views is shifting..In Asia, meanwhile, details emerged of Beijing's latest attempts tomaintain strong relations with many of the world's biggest businesses. China's economy tsar, Vice Premier He Lifeng, met with the heads of Apple, Pfizer, Mastercard, Cargill and others on Sunday..There's no doubting thehuge improvement in investor sentiment towards Chinafollowing the fiscal and monetary measures announced by Beijing since September, and China's markets look set to end the quarter on a high note..Foreign demand for U.S. assets might not be dead yet.As the first quarter draws to a close, financial markets are at a crossroads. We could be seeing the early stages of a tectonic shift in global investment flows, with a dramatic decline in demand for U.S. assets from abroad. But it's also possible that this is simply a pause and that the 'U.S. exceptionalism' narrative has more chapters to go..Net sales of U.S. equities by foreign central banks reached $28 billion in January, and net sales of all U.S. assets by the private sector totaled $74.8 billion, according to official Treasury International Capital flows data..These were, respectively, the fastest-ever pace of U.S. equity selling by the official sector in a single month, and the biggest monthly outflow of U.S. assets by private sector investors in a year..This abrupt reversal in flows goes a long way to explaining the eye-opening underperformance of U.S. stocks against the rest of the world so far this year. This gap has approached 15 percentage points in the past few weeks..Of course, one month does not a trend make, and it will take many more months of similar flows to reverse the tide – or more accurately, the tsunami - of foreign capital that flooded into U.S. markets in recent years..TIC data shows that private sector net capital inflows into U.S. stocks and bonds last year totaled $980 billion, following a net inflow of $668 billion the year before and $1.6 trillion in 2022. That's net purchases from overseas investors and net selling of foreign assets by U.S. investors..The total figure is worth repeating. In the last three calendar years, private sector investors poured a net $3.25 trillion into U.S. assets. Little wonder that foreign investors at the end of last year owned 18% of U.S. stocks, according to Goldman Sachs. That's a record-high share going back to 1945..At an average of more than $1 trillion a year, that pace of net inflows was unlikely to be maintained. But does that mean that January's pace of selling will persist? Not necessarily..Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin and his team estimate that foreign investors will remain buyers of U.S. equities this year, lured by the weaker dollar, attractive prices due to the recent correction, and the unparalleled liquidity of U.S. markets..They reckon overseas investors will be just as committed this year as they were last year, buying a net $300 billion compared with $304 billion in 2024. They do note, however, that ""elevated political and economic uncertainty also create elevated uncertainty around that forecast."".Appetite for U.S. assets will remain strong as long the U.S. maintains an innovation-friendly tax system, flexible financial system, commitment to property rights and a relatively low regulatory burden, agrees Standard Chartered's head of G10 FX strategy Steven Englander..""Cyclical ups and downs in equity and other asset prices would not erase this attractiveness in the long term, even if the correction in U.S. equities continues, provided the underlying positives remain in place,"" he says..It is important to note that TIC flows reports are released with a lag, meaning January's outflows don't account for the notable market shifts seen in recent weeks. The February and March reports could show massive outflows too..There are good reasons why foreign investors have backed away from U.S. assets in recent weeks - stretched valuations, market concentration, the emergence of China's DeepSeek artificial intelligence model, Germany's watershed fiscal U-turn, and concern surrounding the Trump administration's trade and foreign policy agendas..This is all to say it remains unclear whether the recent shift in investment flows is temporary or represents a true paradigm shift. The next few months will be critical..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com.

2025-03-21,"Tittle:Trading Day: No direction Jerome
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, March 20 (Reuters) - Post-Fed rally fades, global caution mounts.U.S. markets struggled for clear direction on Thursday, as investors cooled some of their optimism around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's view that the economy is in good shape and tariff-related price rises will be transitory..Wall Street's bullish momentum from the previous day fizzled out and Treasuries and the dollar rose, indicating a broader 'risk-off' tone at play. Gold, which has already rocketed 16% this year to new highs, held its ground too..It remains to be seen whether Powell's confidence will be justified.The signs are ominous, as I will explain below.Warnings from around the worldabout the uncertain outlook have proliferated this week, from theBank of Japanon Wednesday to theBank of England,Swiss National Bank,Sweden's RiksbankandEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagardeon Thursday..Today's Key Market Moves..So, the day after the afternoon before, and markets took a more tempered view on the Fed's new economic projections and Powell's press conference. As BNP Paribas's Guneet Dhingra wryly noted, given the level of economic uncertainty, perhaps the post-Fed reaction itself was always likely to be 'transitory'..And so it seems. Powell is already coming in for some flak, although not from an entirely unexpected source. ""The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S. Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing,"" President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday..Investors are now starting to turn their attention to April 2, whenTrump's proposed reciprocal tariffstake effect. If they kick in as planned, other countries will likely take counter measures and a 'tit for tat' spiral could accelerate. That would be bad news for world growth, inflation, and markets..Deutsche Bank economists on Thursday said that the rise in trade policy uncertainty could shave 0.75 percentage points from U.S. GDP through mid-2026. But that assumes uncertainty quickly returns to 'normal'. If it remains at current levels through June, the hit to growth could be double that..And as the old adage goes, if the U.S. catches a cold - especially one that severe - the rest of the world will be sneezing..Investors draw transitory vs stagflation battle lines.The fate of U.S. financial markets this year will largely depend on whether any tariff-fueled inflation turns out to be ""transitory"", enabling the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, or whether the central bank gets bogged down by the specter of ""stagflation""..The first scenario is the one ChairJerome Powell outlinedon Wednesday as the central bank's ""base case"", sparking a powerfulrally on Wall Streetand a sharp drop in Treasury bond yields. So it's risk on, right?.Investors chose to ignore the second scenario, even though it is arguably the more obvious one to draw from the Fed's revised economic projections..Policymakers are now expecting higher inflation and meaningfully slower growth. The median interest rate 'dot plot' was unchanged from December, still pointing to two cuts this year, but there's a shift underway - eight policymakers now think one cut or none at all will be appropriate this year. So, risk off?.'Team transitory' may have stolen a march on 'team stagflation', but a lot of stars will need to align for it to emerge victorious over the long haul..Many investors likely shuddered when Powell invoked the T-word on Wednesday, given the Fed has had to keep rates higher for longer precisely because the post-pandemic inflation surge wasn't as transitory as Powell and then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had claimed..That said, Powell is correct that the inflation caused by President Donald Trump's 1.0 trade war was transitory. Academic studies suggest the first-round impact of Trump's 2018 tariffs added up to 0.3 percentage points to core PCE inflation, but annual core PCE inflation in 2018 never exceeded 2% and fell in 2019..Still, the Fed's credibility took a beating with the post-pandemic 'transitory' debacle, so Powell may be leaving himself and the institution open to further attacks if any future price increases prove to be stickier than bargained for..This is a genuine risk because Trump's proposed tariffs are of a whole different order this time around. A Boston Fed paper last month estimated that the first-round impact of tariffs could add between 1.4 and 2.2 percentage points to core PCE..This would have a much deeper and longer-lasting impact on inflation. Fed officials are wary. Not only did they raise their median 2025 inflation outlook, but some also raised their 2026 and 2027 projections, and 18 out of 19 believe price risks are still skewed to the upside..It's also worth noting that Fed officials lowered their growth projections significantly more than they raised their inflation outlook..The 2025 growth outlook fell to 1.7% from 2.1%, and down to 1.8% for the next two years. Granted, that's still decent growth and nowhere near a recession, but it would mark the first back-to-back years of sub-2% expansion since 2011-12..Moreover, 18 out of 19 Fed officials see growth risks still tilted to the downside, compared with only five in December. Even if the Fed does cut rates, it is just as likely to be in response to the economy rolling over and unemployment shooting up than anything else. Would that be 'risk on'?.While no one is talking about a return to the 1970s, stagflation risks are rising, which hugely complicates the Fed's reaction function. The bar for cutting rates is getting higher, and it is difficult to see how this creates a positive environment for risk-taking – that is, unless team transitory emerges victorious in the end..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com.

2025-03-20,"Tittle:In the Market: How Trump is driving Asia to diversify away from US
Article:.March 20 - President Donald Trump's tariffs and other policies have some financiers and officials in Asia predicting the remaking of the post-World War II economic order, leading to an urgent quest to diversify away from America. But it's not proving to be easy..The period after World War II saw a global order underpinned by multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Bank. The United States emerged as the dominant force, with the dollar as the world's reserve currency..The Trump administration appears to be breaking from that order, with foreign and economic policies that have challenged U.S. allies, undercut some multilateral institutions and used tactics such as tariffs..While it is unclear what will eventually emerge, interviews this month with more than a dozen senior bankers, investors and officials based in Asia showed that they are not waiting to find out. They are looking for an 'America plus 1' strategy, which reduces their reliance on the United States going forward..This search for an alternative was more urgent and widespread than last May, when I firstreported such a conversationafter a visit to Asia. Strikingly, no one seems to have found an answer. These people said there may not be a viable alternative to the U.S. market in the foreseeable future..""We are in a one in 100-year transition,"" said Ben Hung, President, International at Standard Chartered. Hung believes the world is becoming multipolar, led by the United States, China and India. ""The post-World War II order has changed."".Citi told me it was fielding record calls from Asian clients on how to navigate through increased geopolitical uncertainty..The bank said its flows from clients such as companies in areas, including foreign exchange and hedging, were growing at double digits in many emerging trade corridors, such as those between Asia and the Middle East as well as Latin America. Even so, investments into the United States were also growing..In response to questions about this view, Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, pointed to U.S. investment promises by companies like Taiwanese chipmakerTSMCand Dubai property developerDAMAC, saying they ""have responded to President Trump's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy."".These conversations underscore how Trump's America First push could accelerate changes that were already under way with the growth of China as the world's second-largest economy, in some ways undermining its goals to counter it..The White House's unprecedented moves across policy areas, such as playinginvestment banker on the sale of social media app TikTok, are raising questions in the minds of these people about the U.S. rule of law. That, alongside the use of economic sanctions, has foreign investors and companies wishing for alternatives to U.S. assets and the dollar..One Chinese official said Trump's tariffs against U.S. allies such as Canada and Europe had given Beijing an opening. Trump cannot isolate China with U.S. allies because ""his allies are also facing tariffs,"" the official said, declining to be named to talk candidly about the situation..Chinese companies have to diversify, reducing their exposure to the United States and increasing it in other parts of the world, from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to Latin America, the official added..Despite this search for alternatives, U.S. assets remain attractive, these interviews showed. That's because of the size of the American economy, the depth of its capital markets and the relative strength of its institutions, especially when compared with authoritarian governments elsewhere..There are also limited choices. Anyone looking for an alternative to the dollar outside the U.S. sphere of influence, for example, has three options: gold, crypto and the yuan. Some of therun-up in goldin recent months is attributed to central banks diversifying away from the dollar..""None of those three are perfect,"" Standard Chartered's Hung said..Any company looking to do transactions in the yuan instead of the dollar, for example, would need instruments to hedge its exposure to it..Hung said one of the main ways to do so would be through the Hong Kong Exchange’s Swap Connect, which allows investors to trade renminbi interest rate swaps, derivatives that help manage interest rate risk..Swap Connect grew to 14.9 billion yuan ($2.06 billion) in average daily turnover last year, which is significantly higher than the 3 billion yuan when it was launched in May 2023. Several bankers said any hedging to manage exposure to the yuan from companies transacting in the Chinese currency was marginal..Meanwhile, the costs of the fracturing of the world are becoming increasingly clear. It's creating blind spots, something that became apparent when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek surprised investors in January, sendingU.S. markets into a tailspin..While it was impossible to predict DeepSeek's impact on the market, two people in Hong Kong told me that those following China's artificial intelligence sector closely would have likely come across the company..One Asia-based investor told me he had met with the founder late last year. He added that his firm had seen much less competition from U.S. private equity and venture investors in recent years..Bonnie Chan, CEO of the Hong Kong bourse operator, said Western investors had hesitated to invest in China after a challenging few years for exits..""This vintage of sort of the newer companies like DeepSeek probably didn't attract all the crazy courting from the VC and PE guys like the previous batch of companies,"" Chan said. ""And that's why I feel that DeepSeek is just one of the many things which will shock investors around the world."".""There will be more jaw-dropping moments,"" Chan added..($1 = 7.2327 Chinese yuan)"
2025-03-20,"Tittle:TRADING DAY Markets soar as Powell brings back 'transitory'
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, March 19 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY.Parsing the Fed's new economic projections and 'dot plot'.Wall Street rallied sharplyand Treasury yields fell on Wednesday as investors bet that theFederal Reservewill look through rising price pressures and continue cutting interest rates this year, after new projections showed that officials now expect lower growth and higher inflation..While the median projection of two more rate cuts this year is still policymakers' base case,the underlying 'dot plot' forecastsshifted up closer towards only one. But not quite..Investors ignored that, however. They also ignored the growing ""stagflation"" risks and officials' admission that uncertainty is elevated. Instead, they seized on Chair Jerome Powell's belief that tariff-driven inflation will be ""transitory"" and largely confined to this year..I will dig deeper into the confusing signals sent by various measures of inflation expectations below. But first, here are the scores on the doors from Wednesday's trading around the world..Today's Key Market Moves..The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged was widely expected. This left investors to take their cue from other aspects of what turned out to be a remarkable day that included: significant changes in the economic forecasts, underlying shifts in the ""dot plot,"" Powell's resurrection of ""transitory"" to describe inflation, and the Fed saying it willslow the ongoing drawdown of its balance sheet..Before all that, Wall Street's big three indices were up between 0.3% and 0.6%, the dollar was up across the board and Treasury yields were up as much as 5 basis points across the curve..Much of that was paring back the previous day's moves that were marked by a widespread risk aversion among investors although, interestingly, gold didn't pull back and held onto the $3,000 an ounce area..Butinvestors took Powell's stance to be extremely ""dovish,""and stocks leaped even higher, yields tumbled, the dollar cooled and gold marched on..It will be fascinating to see if markets reverse course on Thursday. There's certainly a case to make, given that both the growth and inflation outlooks deteriorated - stagflation is rarely a bullish environment for risk assets..What's more, relying on inflation being ""transitory"" hasn't always worked out well..Earlier on Wednesday,the Bank of Japan kept rates on hold as expectedand, on balance,signaled that it will proceed cautiously on policy tighteningdue to heightened global economic and tariff uncertainty even though Governor Kazuo Ueda also said rising food costs and strong wage growth could push up inflation..Traders slightly trimmed their rate hike bets, and now put a very slim chance on the next move - and only hike this year - coming in October rather than September..On the geopolitical front, U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed on Wednesday to work together to end Russia's war with Ukraine, in what the White House described asa ""fantastic"" one-hour phone call..Muddled inflation expectations no help for Fed.Keeping inflation expectations under control is arguably a central bank's most important job. But it is also one of the most challenging given that the picture painted by the surveys, models and market prices relied on by policymakers is, at best, unclear, and at worst, so muddled as to be barely useful at all..That's especially true today, and one more reason why the Federal Reserve is proceeding with caution..Consumer expectations can, understandably, be volatile. The layperson is unlikely to have a firm grasp on how global supply chains, commodity prices or monetary policy lags affect prices. They could therefore easily be influenced - or spooked - by news headlines and current conditions. Survey responses are thus often based more on emotion than economic analysis..This helps explain why the five-year inflation outlook in the University of Michigan's latest survey of consumers jumped to 3.9% in February. That's the highest since 1993, and was undoubtedly driven by legitimate fears about the impact U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could have on prices..Yet the New York Fed's February survey tells a very different story. It shows that the U.S. public's five-year inflation horizon was unchanged from January at 3.0%. Indeed, this report's five-year outlook has been stuck in a 2.5-3.0% range for more than two years..If that's not confusing enough, financial markets' long-term inflation outlook suggests there's no need to worry at all..Five-year/five-year forward breakevens, a measure of expected inflation over a five-year period starting in five years' time, have been trending lower in recent weeks and were last trading around 2.1%. That's the lowest in two years, significantly below current annual CPI inflation of 2.8%, and practically at the Fed's 2% target..This suggests investors believe tariff shocks will pass, the Fed will keep policy sufficiently tight to get inflation down, or growth will be weak. Or some combination of all three..Given that consumer expectations, particularly over the shorter one-year and three-year horizons, are more volatile than market-based measures, how should policymakers make sense of these conflicting signals?.A Cleveland Fed paper from October 2021 suggests they should be taken with a grain of salt. It found that the predictive relationship of a range of inflation expectation gauges was hit and miss. And much more miss than hit..Researchers found that consumers are particularly bad at predicting inflation. Again, this may be no real surprise given that people without a financial background often struggle to distinguish between the price level and the rate of price increases..Though, for what it's worth, the Cleveland Fed researchers found that financial markets' predictive power isn't that much better..Another 2021 paper by Fed staffer Jeremy Rudd went further, warning that the relationship between expected and actual inflation ""has no compelling theoretical or empirical basis and could potentially result in serious policy errors."".That's a troubling conclusion given the importance policymakers put on keeping inflation expectations anchored..But Fed Chair Jerome Powell doesn't seem worried. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday after Fed officials cut their GDP growth projections but raised the inflation outlook, he insisted that long-term expectations remain well-contained even if short-term ones are rising..The recent University of Michigan survey was an ""outlier"", but will still be factored into policymakers' thinking along with all the other indicators they look at..""We monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully, every source we can find. We do not take anything for granted,"" Powell said, adding that anchored inflation expectations are at ""the very heart of our framework."".What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com.

2025-03-19,"Tittle:Trading Day: Flickering recovery snuffed out
Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, March 18 (Reuters) - Another wild one on Wall Street as Fed, BOJ decisions loom..U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, buckling under the weight of worry building on multiple fronts fromgeopoliticaltensionsto the outlook forBig Tech, fromeconomic uncertaintyto deepening unease around President Donald Trump'strade wars..The selloff is a reminder, as if one were needed, of how fragile market sentiment is right now - visibility on the economic, policy, and geopolitical outlooks is minimal. No wonder investors are jittery..Treasuries failed to catch much of a safe-haven bid, perhaps because investors wanted to keep positioning light ahead of the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday. But gold did,leaping 1% to a new high above $3,000 an ounce..Wall Street's losses on Wednesday, coupled withEurope's rallyafterGermany's parliament approved plansfor a massive spending surge, highlight the degree of America's equity underperformance against the 'Rest of the World'..It's a trend that seems more likely to continue than reverse. More on that below, but first, here are how world markets stacked up on Tuesday..Today's Key Market Moves..U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday discussed a potential 30-day ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. But while Moscow agreed to stop attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it did not agree to a blanket 30-day ceasefire..This helped keep the selling pressure bearing down on Wall Street, and maintain the bid under gold and the Swiss franc..Barring unforeseen developments on the geopolitical or trade war fronts - a brave assumption these days - investors' attention now switches to the big central banks. First up on Wednesday is theBank of Japan, then theFederal Reserve..It's probably no surprise, given the volatile global climate, that hawkish expectations for the BOJ are fading. No one was expecting another rate hike on Wednesday anyway, but rates markets are not fully pricing in the next 25 bps hike until September. And that's it for the year..This could explain why the yen has eased off lately, failing to get much support from safe-haven demand or surging Japanese bond yields..Investors' attention on the Fed, meanwhile, will be split between policymakers' new economic projections, what they say about the central bank's balance sheet rundown, and the signals drawn from Chair Powell's press conference..Markets, especially the bond market, could be coiled for a big move, and there are several lines of questioning to Powell that could provide the trigger -tightening financial conditions, Wall Street's weakness, the impact of Trump's tariffs on growth and inflation, recession risks, or spiking consumer inflation expectations..It's shaping up to be a fascinating day across U.S. and world markets..Investors RoW back on Wall Street exceptionalism.As the end of the first quarter approaches, world stock markets are in a curious position. They are benefiting from capital flowing out of Wall Street, but they also face major risks if the U.S. selloff turns into a rout..As President Donald Trump's trade war has snuffed out the ""U.S. exceptionalism"" narrative, a yawning gap has opened between U.S. equities and those in the 'Rest of the World'..The selloff abated briefly and the S&P 500 notched its first consecutive daily rises in a month. But Wall Street was back in the red on Tuesday, and U.S. underperformance - the widest in more than 20 years, by some measures - shows little sign of reversing course..Indeed, history suggests this gap could widen further, although only if the U.S. economy avoids tipping into a serious recession..As the S&P 500 flirted with 10% correction territory last week, 'RoW' markets were outperforming by as much as 9 percentage points, the biggest such gap since 2002, according to strategists at Citi..Historically, when U.S. corrections eclipse the 10% mark but don't breach the 20% 'bear market' threshold, Wall Street underperforms over the entire downturn, Citi noted. In U.S. bear markets and recessions, however, no country or market is immune - growth and asset prices everywhere suffer..This scenario appears to be unfolding. Most economists agree that U.S. growth will slow this year, but few think it will fall off a cliff. While the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is signaling a 2.1% contraction in Q1, that remains an outlier..Contrast that with the sudden improvement in Germany's growth outlook thanks to Berlin's proposed fiscal bazooka. Beijing also appears ready to do whatever it takes to support China's economy and markets – call it the 'Xi put'..Indeed, the tailwinds for RoW outperformance seem to be building..The rotation out of Wall Street to the rest of the world has been underway all year. Bank of America's March fund manager survey shows that allocations to euro zone markets are the highest since 2021, while U.S. allocations plunged at the fastest rate on record..This might suggest the switch has run its course. But the same survey also showed that the most crowded trade is still 'long' the Magnificent Seven shares of America's biggest tech firms..And even though U.S. earnings multiples have fallen to the lowest point since September, they remain lofty by historical standards due to Big Tech's still-rich valuations. Indeed, U.S. stock valuations remain well above those in other developed markets, so this rotation may be far from over..""Corrections are healthy, they're normal,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told 'Meet The Press' on Sunday, adding: ""I'm not worried about the markets..Corrections are indeed normal and healthy, occurring roughly once every couple of years with an average decline of 14%. As Mark Riepe at Charles Schwab points out, of the 27 corrections since 1974 including the current one, only six have gone on to become bear markets..But Bessent's remarks could also be interpreted as a sign of how relaxed the Trump administration is about the current decline, suggesting they won't act to prevent a further slide. It's a risky stance to take at such a delicate juncture for the economy..And the RoW needs to watch out, because its outperformance will likely only continue if the U.S. doesn't implode. As Dario Perkins at TS Lombard notes, ""Make no mistake – a U.S. recession would bring down the entire world."".That would quickly wipe out Wall Street's underperformance, but unfortunately, also a whole lot more..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com.

Article:.ORLANDO, Florida, March 13 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY.Making sense of the forces driving global markets.Well, that didn't last long..A wave of selling across global stocks on Thursday snuffed out any flickering hopes of stabilization or recovery from the previous day, as thelatest salvofrom U.S. President Donald Trump in the global trade war sent investors running for cover..After the European Union responded to blanket U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by imposing a 50% tax on American whiskey exports,Trumpon Thursday threatened to charge a 200% tariff on imports of European wines and spirits..Thursday was a classic 'risk off' day - as they slammed stocks and riskier assets lower, investors scampered to the traditional safe-haven harbors of U.S. Treasuries, the dollar andgold, which surged to a new high just under $3,000 an ounce..There's a growing sense that Trump is willing to accept the economic and marketdamagehis tariff policy is inflicting right now. Until investors can be convinced otherwise, the path of least resistance for equities and risk assets is probably to the downside, even though the selloff is getting pretty extreme..Today's Key Market Moves..Japanese futures are pointing to a fall of 0.7% at the open in Tokyo on Friday, and world markets can expect a rocky end to the week. Asia and Europe have performed relatively well in recent weeks, but the dam can't hold forever..On top of the trade chaos, investors are having to grapple with another potential worry from Washington - a partial U.S. governmentshutdown, which may come as soon as 12:01 a.m. local time on Saturday if lawmakers fail to agree on a stopgap funding bill..U.S. rates traders are now fully pricing in three quarter-point rate cuts this year from the Fed, attaching a roughly 40% probability to the first of those coming in May..Consumerprice inflation on Wednesday andproducerprice inflation on Thursday were softer than expected, which helped fuel these increasingly dovish bets. But the deteriorating growth outlook is the main driver, and the steep losses on Wall Street will only intensify expectations that the Fed will act soon..Would this be the 'Fed put'? in action? Probably not, as most analysts reckon we're still a long way from policymakers providing the sliding market a backstop. But if the snowball turns into an avalanche, you never know..How low is the 'Fed put'?.Every time a Wall Street selloff snowballs, fear of an avalanche revives talk of the ""Fed put"". Thecorrectionunderway now is no different, but the bar for the central bank to provide the market a backstop is now likely a high one..The notion of the Fed put – the idea that the Federal Reserve will prop up falling asset prices with monetary easing or other tools – took root in the Alan Greenspan era (1987-2006) and has been embedded in investor psyche ever since..Part of the Fed's mandate, of course, is ensuring financial stability, so, in a sense, the Fed put has always existed and can always be used. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09 and the pandemic in 2020 are two examples of the Fed put in action..As strategists at HSBC point out, the Fed put doesn't have to be emergency rate cuts or QE. Adding a line in its policy statement that financial conditions have tightened considerably, for example, could calm the horses..The current selloff is obviously nothing like those crises. But that hasn't stopped speculation that further declines could soon get the Fed's attention, with theNasdaqnow deep in correction territory - 10% or more below the previous peak - and theS&P 500flirting with it..There is good reason to be vigilant. The Trump administration's chaotic trade policy agenda is generatinghuge uncertaintyforconsumers, businesses and investors, and causing recession risks to rise..Some $5 trillion has been wiped off the value of U.S. stocks in less than a month, led by steep declines in Big Tech. The Roundhill equal-weighted 'Magnificent Seven' ETF is down 20% from its December peak..Given the concentration of stock ownership in the hands of the country's richest income decile, who now account for a record 50% of all consumer spending, weakness on Wall Street could quickly rip through the wider economy..Policymakers will also be paying close attention to financial conditions, which are now the tightest in nearly a year, according to Goldman Sachs' financial conditions index. This tightening is almost entirely due to the equity slump..But the wider economic environment strongly suggests markets will have to fall much further or faster before triggering a policy response..Whilevolatilityacross equities, bonds and some key currency pairs is the highest in months and rising, it remains significantly below levels typically associated with past market crises..The same goes for credit spreads. U.S. high-yield spreads widened beyond 300 basis points this week for the first time in six months, but that's still miles below the spreads of 800, 900 or even 2,000 bps witnessed over the last few decades..Liquidity also still seems, to coin a Fed term, ample. There are no gapping prices in key markets, trades can be executed smoothly, there is no sign of stress in funding markets, and the corporate bond primary market is still open for business..What's more, a market or economic downturn may not be as deflationary as previous slumps because any downturn now would likely be driven partly by the import tariffs PresidentDonald Trumpis threatening to impose – and tariffs risk increasing prices while hindering growth. A tumbling stock market and 'stagflation' would be extremely awkward for the Fed and potentiallytie its hands..Strategists at HSBC reckon the strike price of any policy put - from the Trump administration or the Fed - is probably ""some ways off still"". The S&P 500's average downturn from peaks is 14%, and even then it still usually ends the year higher with no Fed put. The market is currently 10% off its peak..According to Treasury SecretaryScott Bessent, there is no ""Trump put"", and the president himself said last week he's ""not even looking at the market."" The Trump administration appears willing to let asset prices fall and growth slow as part of the""detox period"" or ""transition""towards a more private sector-based economy..Strategists at Morgan Stanley argue there's a ""much greater likelihood of a Fed Put than a Trump Put,"" contrasting Trump and Bessent's statements with Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks that the Fed has tools to deploy in case of extreme economic stress..That is probably true. But the strike price might be lower than many investors would like..What could move markets tomorrow?.If you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today..I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments atjamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com, opens new tab.

2025-03-13,"Tittle:Commodities tune out of Trump's noise to trade fundamentals
Article:.LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 13 (Reuters) - Dial out the noise and focus on the fundamentals is a tactic that may work best for global commodity markets as they navigate the mounting challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump's erratic and inconsistent trade policies..While the media focus on each headline-grabbing announcement and social media post about new and retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. leader and his administration, commodity markets are busy doing what they have done so well in the past, adapting to rapidly changing circumstances..For commodities it's important to make distinctions between those already being affected by Trump's trade policies, those likely to be in the future, and those unlikely to suffer direct impact, but which might feel second-round effects from a slowing world economy..The first group includes steel and aluminium, with Trump's 25% tariffs on all imports of the metals having started..The main impact is likely to be price increases for steel and aluminium in the United States, as domestic producers have limited scope to boost output significantly..That will force consumers of the metals to pay the tariffs, and they are also likely to face increases in the cost of U.S.-sourced metals as local producers raise prices to match those of competing imports..Over the longer term it is possible that U.S. aluminium and steel makers will increase capacity and output, or that foreign producers will build plants in the United States..But whether this happens depends very much on whether companies take the view that the tariffs are largely permanent, and if the U.S. economy will be strong enough to justify making the investments..For countries outside the United States there may be some re-ordering of trade flows as they seek to replace metals previously sold to the United States, but a far bigger risk is the threat of a synchronised global economic slowdown as tariffs cut trade flows, boost inflation and cut competitive advantages..Commodities in Trump's firing line include crude oil and copper, albeit from different perspectives..Trump has indicated he intends to put a tariff on copper imports, a move that is drawing copper inventories from Asia and Europe to the United States and increasing the price of U.S. copper relative to other global benchmarks..This a straight arbitrage play likely to wind down as soon as tariffs take effect, or not, depending on what Trump eventually decides..Disruption to the global copper market is likely to be limited, with the fate of China's economy this year more of a driver, since it is the world's biggest importer and processor of the metal..An example of looking at fundamentals and ignoring noise is reaction to Trump's reported plan to build metals refining facilities on U.S. military bases as he moves to ensure a secure supply of critical minerals..Trump is rightly concerned about China's control over much of the sourcing and processing of critical minerals, which include metals such as copper, lithium and cobalt, as well as minor metals such as tungsten and rare earths..But it is questionable whether the solution is to build refineries on military bases..The United States would still have to source the raw ores, often from foreign countries, and nothing Trump is doing would seem to be ensuring greater U.S. access to resources..Trump has effectively killed foreign aid, and with it much of his country's soft power, and his bullying tactics and tariffs on friend and foe alike are ruining the image and reputation of the United States..It would be hard to find a stauncher U.S. ally than Australia, but in the wake of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese urged fellow citizens to buy local rather than U.S. goods..""Buy Bundy rather than some of the American products … You can make a difference,"" Albanese said in a radio interview on Thursday, referring to the renowned domestic rum..Australia has major reserves of numerous critical minerals, but with Trump treating the country as a trade enemy it is increasingly difficult to see cooperation on investment in developing mines and processing..Crude oil is another commodity that may be affected by Trump's policies, but more from a geopolitical view than tariffs..If Trump does try to use sanctions to force Iran's crude exports to near zero, this will tighten supply and be bullish for prices..If he does manage to secure a peace deal in Ukraine, it is likely to be on Russia's terms and result in an easing of sanctions, which may boost supply..There is also the risk that U.S. crude exports are included in retaliatory tariffs should the trade war continue to escalate, which would force a re-ordering of global flows..Liquefied natural gas (LNG), of which the United States is the biggest shipper, is also at risk of being sucked into trade wars, and this has already started with China's tariffs, which are likely to end Beijing's purchases of U.S. cargoes..One commodity quietly benefiting from Trump's decisions is gold, which has rallied to record highs as investors seek a safe haven..While Trump has not mentioned gold as a tariff target, it is worth remarking that much of the precious metal's current rally of about 15% since his November election victory to Wednesday's close of $2,932.06 an ounce, is built on buying by U.S. investors..From December to February, some 600 metric tons of gold was transferred to CME-approved vaults, says consultancy Metals Focus, which has tightened physical supply in the top-consuming region of Asia..In some ways gold is the poster child for how commodities should deal with Trump. Assess the risks, act accordingly and don't make too much noise about it..The views expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

Inflation for January was revised to 4.26% from 4.31%..""February CPI came below ours and market expectations led by a sharp fall in food inflation. There is expectation that our estimate of 4.8% for FY25 will likely see a downside."".""We continue to expect the RBI to cut repo rate by 25 bps in April policy even as it continues to ease the liquidity deficit in the system."".""Inflation decelerated at a faster pace than expected as food corrected sharply in February, on the back of a year-on-year decline in vegetables and pulses, while edible oils alongside cereals held ground."".""The jump in core inflation to 4% reflected higher gold costs, while the contribution of other segments was little changed. Armed with this low inflation read, the MPC is likely to be comfortable to ease rates in April."".""The larger-than-expected fall in Indian headline consumer price inflation to below the RBI's 4% target in February supports our view that the central bank will continue to loosen monetary policy over the coming months."".""In terms of policy implications, February's inflation data is further confirmation that the RBI can continue to focus on boosting economic growth. And with inflation looking set to stay close to the RBI's 4% target for the remainder of the year, we think the central bank will feel comfortable continuing to lower interest rates."".""We forecast another 75bp of interest rate cuts this cycle, bringing the repo rate down to 5.50%, which is a slightly more dovish view than that of the consensus."".""Core inflation still remains benign indicating negative output gap. We see space for further monetary policy easing by RBI. We expect 25 basis points cut in April and 25 basis points cut in June."".""We expect further liquidity infusion of 2 trillion rupees in FY26 to insure system liquidity is a mild positive. This is essential for transmission of rate cuts."".""The significant easing in headline inflation can be attributed to lower food inflation, led by deflation in the vegetables category."".""Core inflation edged up due to higher gold prices. The trajectory of food inflation will need close monitoring amidst evolving climatic risks. For now, the recent CPI reading gives credence to our expectations of a rate cut in April."".""After a long draught, CPI headline and CPI food seem to be converging with food inflation at 3.75% With this a disinflation in vegetables is the key driver."".""Amidst the global cacophony of tariffs, especially the high food tariffs charged by India to protect its sensitive agriculture sector, domestic inflation being in bounds gives some breather that tariff shocks can be navigated to some extent."".""Hugely lower vegetable and food prices due to the influx of fresh winter produce helped headline inflation. Whereas core was higher owing to marginally higher gold prices, and some pick up in core services."".""Reciprocal tariff by U.S. has potential to make a dent in Indian economic growth in FY26. February 2025 retail inflation would be a key factor for monetary policy committee meeting of April 2025."".""We expect RBI to cut policy rates by 25bp and maintain sufficient liquidity in the system."".""Despite the shocker on core, the pleasant headline CPI surprise implies that the Q4 FY25 inflation may undershoot RBI's forecast by more than 40bps, and could keep the rate cut possibility in April solid – as was also reflected in the recent dovish policy minutes."".""However, we are keeping a tab on the fluid global dynamics and FX knock-on effect as well. So far, subdued global oil prices have tempered the knock-on effect from a weaker INR (Indian rupee). Besides, changing global narrative on growth and tariff noises may allow EM Central banks to be more tolerant to weaker FX, letting them ease their policy stance and rates."".""We believe that the sequential uptick in vegetables inflation in March 2025 is likely to prevent a further softening in the food and beverages inflation print in the month, after the substantial cooling seen over the past four months. This would push up the CPI inflation print mildly to about 3.9-4.0% in the next month."".""The Feb 2025 CPI inflation print falling well below 4% has cemented the expectation of a back-to-back 25 bps rate cut in the April 2025 MPC meeting. This may be followed by another 25 bps repo rate cut either in the June 2025 or the August 2025 meetings, dependant in large part on the next GDP growth print for Q4 FY2025."".""With inflation trending lower than anticipated, the average CPI for the quarter is now expected to fall below the RBI’s initial projection of 4.4%. Easing food prices, coupled with lower global crude oil prices, have provided a supportive backdrop for inflation to align more closely with the RBI's 4% target."".""Against this backdrop, the RBI, which recently cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and implemented liquidity measures to address the system's deficit, is likely to maintain its easing cycle. The central bank's stance is influenced by growing concerns over the economic growth outlook, given rising global trade uncertainties and the increasing prevalence of protectionist policies."""

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction..The U.S. Geological Survey lists lithium, nickel and 48 other minerals as critical. Adding copper would help Freeport generate more than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Quirk told Reuters on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston..""Having the incentives and clarity around those would be a big plus for the domestic copper industry,"" said Quirk, whobecame CEO of Phoenix-based Freeportlast year..""People are understanding more what copper is used for and its importance in our economy. It's just a matter of time before it's classified as a critical mineral."".Former President Joe Biden's administration extended the tax creditto critical mineralslast October. Copper producers cannot access it unless their product is labeled as critical..All the copper that Freeport produces at its seven U.S. mines is consumed domestically, making it the country's largest producer of the metal. Freeport also operates one of two U.S. copper smelters and produces more than 200 million pounds of the metal annually usingleaching..The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits in Freeport's U.S. mines, is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. Freeport's least profitable region..""We're not looking for handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic production, it's important to recognize that the U.S. doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" said Quirk..Last month, Trumplaunched a probeinto potential new tariffs on copper imports to help rebuild U.S. production..U.S. copper tariffs could boost Freeport's profits by $400 million annually, yet the company is worried about their impact on the global economy, Quirk said..""We're not out there advocating one way or the other. We're wanting to make sure that there's education so that there's informed decisions about all of this,"" Quirk said..In Indonesia, where Freeport operates the Grasberg copper and gold mine, Quirk said the company expects to reach an agreement soon with Jakarta that would allowcopper concentrate exportsby the end of the month..Elsewhere, Trump has expressed interest in minerals projects in Greenland and Ukraine.

It is unclear if the court has received other starting offers..The U.S. District Court in Delaware is auctioning shares in PDV Holding to repay $21.3 billion in claims against Venezuela and state-oil firm PDVSA, which owns PDV, for expropriations and debt defaults..Houston-based Citgo is the crown jewel of Venezuela's overseas assets. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has called the auction a ""robbery"" of Venezuela's assets in the United States. His government has criticized U.S. sanctions on the country, in force since 2019..Since 2019, Citgo and its affiliated companies have been controlled by supervising boards that were appointed by Venezuela's opposition-led National Assembly. The U.S. Treasury Department, which last year extended its protection over Citgo for three more months, must give its green light to the auction's winner..The court could pick the initial offer by a consortium led by Gold Reserve's subsidiary Dalinar Energy Corporation, which also includes two units of U.S. conglomerate Koch, setting the starting point or the minimally accepted offer..A topping-off period would follow for the court to receive rival bids, with a final hearing on the sale set for July, according to the court's schedule..Gold Reserve said the terms of the bid would remain confidential until all offers have been reviewed, but did say that Dalinar Energy's bid relies on a combination of equity and debt financing..If accepted, the offer would satisfy ""a substantial percentage of Gold Reserve's attached judgment,"" estimated in about $1 billion plus interests. It also includes a mechanism whereby creditors junior to Gold Reserve would have the option to participate by receiving warrants in Gold Reserve in exchange for contributing a portion of their attached judgements to the bid..Citgo has been thetargetof creditors seeking compensation for late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez' nationalization wave and President Nicolas Maduro's failed debt payments..In a court case first introduced in 2017, the Delaware court found Citgo liable for Venezuela’s defaults and expropriations..A total of 18 creditors holding arbitration rulings and court cases against Venezuela and PDVSA totalling $21.3 billion are pursuing proceeds from the auction of shares that was launched in October 2023, but a first bidding round last year failed to meet the creditors' expectations."

Article:.March 10 (Reuters) - Growing challenges to the euro's status as a reserve currency in a fast-changing global economy are, for now, staying the hand of European capitals as they weigh up the repercussions of a potential seizure of frozen Russian assets..Nevertheless, Europe faces an increasingly urgent need to help bankroll Ukraine's survival as President Donald Trump looks to pull the plug on U.S. support and instead bargain with Russia's Vladimir Putin..That throws a spotlight on the roughly $300 billion of Russian central bank assets frozen by the West after Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine three years ago, the bulk of which is held in Europe - mainly as government bonds, the profits from which are used to guarantee loans to Ukraine..While seizing those assets outright may be very tempting, such actions have a long and legally fraught history, and could scare off other central banks looking to park assets in Europe..An early example of such action cited by European economists in research last year was the Soviet confiscation of gold shipped to Moscow by the National Bank of Romania back in 1918. The wars of the 20th century yielded dozens more examples..But European officials who pride themselves on the region's respect for the rule of law are fighting shy of any breach of the legally enshrined immunity of sovereign assets..""This is not for the European Central Bank to debate, but I would certainly submit that the international law basis on which any decision is made will matter as far as other investors are concerned,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said last week..The final decision rests not with the ECB but its political masters in Berlin, Paris and the other 18 capitals of the euro countries. But they will not take Lagarde's argument lightly..""No-one has any interest in doing things that would weaken our system now, which is also being widely attacked elsewhere via trade, tariff, customs policies,"" French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said last week of threats by Trump to impose hefty new levies on European exports..Europe has long had to accept that the euro is unlikely to challenge the dominance of the dollar as a reserve currency - briefly an aspiration in the heady days after its 1999 birth..In fact since 2010, the share of global currency reserves held in the euro has dropped from 25.8% at current exchange rates to 20% as other currencies gain traction. Even the dollar has slipped slightly, while still accounting for 58.4%..In a report last year on the euro's international standing, Lagarde cited challenges ranging from the emergence of other units as trade-invoicing currencies through to renewed interest in gold as a reserve asset in troubled times..Some, however, question the rationale of even seeking to position the euro as a major reserve currency given the weak points in its construction, already exposed in debt crises 15 years ago..""If we assume that this is a political ambition, then indeed the euro is handicapped by the absence of capital markets union, the lack of a euro safe asset and the lack of fully fledged banking union,"" said Hans Geeroms, a professor at the College of Europe and a visiting fellow at the EU think tank Bruegel..Those were among the failings identified by former ECB chief Mario Draghi in areportlast year on how Europe can avoid the ""slow agony"" of an economy falling further behind U.S. and Asian rivals. Yet scant progress has been made on them even now..But if such fragilities help explain why Europe is wary of anything which could weaken the credibility of its currency, wider geopolitical considerations are closing in..Participants at Thursday's summit on boosting European defence spending said no decisions on Russian asset seizures were taken in the talks, with one EU diplomat confirming that Germany, France and Belgium - home to the Euroclear securities depository where many of the assets are parked - had restated their opposition..However Mitu Gulati, an expert on sovereign debt law at the University of Virginia, said Trump's reversal of U.S. policy on Ukraine had shocked Europeans into ""looking to do the things they weren't willing to do six months ago..""The same people that said we are not going to do (full seizure) are calling now to say we are interested,"" said Gulati, who declined to elaborate on which countries he had spoken to..One euro zone central banker who requested anonymity agreed the political pressure to consider confiscation was mounting..""The ECB's advice won't change,"" the banker said. ""But this may not sway politicians. The bill for Ukraine has just gone up a lot, and this makes this money so much more attractive."""

Article:.March 7 (Reuters) - Senior officials of the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump said in a media briefing on Friday that they view bitcoin as deserving ""special treatment"" as the White House forges ahead with plans to create stockpiles of digital assets..Trump signed anexecutive orderon Thursday creating a strategic bitcoin reserve that the officials described as ""a digital Fort Knox for digital gold."".Fort Knox is the United States Bullion Depository, traditional home of a large part of the country's gold reserves, which takes its name from the nearby U.S. Army installation..The order also created a separate digital assets stockpile, to be governed under different rules. Such a move would address some of theconcerns voicedby industry participants ahead of a White House crypto summit on Friday about the prospect of creating a single multi-coin strategic reserve..""Bitcoin is special in our view,"" said one of the senior administration officials. ""It's the original cryptocurrency. It's the most secure; it's never been hacked. It's scarce; the bitcoin protocol limits the number (of coins) to 21 million. It's the most decentralized."".The executive order also allows Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick ""to develop budget-neutral strategies for adding to that reserve."".Just as presidential administrations throughout history have treated gold as a strategic asset to be held indefinitely without worrying about price fluctuations, so the administration will not be concerned about short-term movements in the price of bitcoin, officials said..The rules are different for the digital asset stockpile, which will hold positions in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin acquired by the U.S. through any forfeiture proceedings. The Treasury may not purchase additional holdings for this stockpile..""The principle there is responsible stewardship, and so the secretary of the Treasury has the discretion to make adjustments to that portfolio or adjust that portfolio, as long as it is budget neutral,"" an administration official said..A group of senior crypto industry leaders is scheduled to meet with Trump and other administration leaders, including David Sacks, the president's crypto policy adviser, for a four-hour-long roundtable discussion starting at 1:30 PM ET on Friday at the White House."

In January, the London holdings dropped by 1.7%..The supplies to the U.S. in recent months came from London, the world's largest over-the-counter (OTC) gold trading hub,Switzerlandand other major hubs..In London, this activity thinned liquidity in the OTC market, which the LBMA oversees, and prompted a race among London bullion market players to borrow gold from central banks, which store their bullion in the Bank of England's vaults..""While stocks in the Bank of England declined by a similar pace to that seen in January, gold stocks in London's commercial vaults in fact increased,"" the LBMA said..""This highlights that  gold is moving from BoE into the Loco London system but also shows that the market  dynamics that led to gold travelling to New York in recent months have somewhat eased."".The outflow of silver from the London vaults to the U.S. also slowed in February: the holdings fell by 4.5% from January to 22,462 tons, the lowest in the LBMA data going back to mid-2016, and were worth $22.5 billion..In January, silver holdings dropped by 8.6%."

In early European trading on Friday, bitcoin has recovered to trade at $89,200 ..A ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was seized as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the White House crypto czar, billionaire David Sacks, said in a post on social media platform X..The order kept open the possibility of the government buying bitcoin in future. The U.S. commerce and treasury secretaries ""are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers,"" a factsheet on the White House website said..""The significance of this executive order is mainly symbolic, as it marks the first time Bitcoin is formally recognized as a reserve asset of the United States government,"" said Andrew O'Neill, digital assets managing director at S&P Global Ratings..""The reserve will only include Bitcoin already owned by the US government,"" O'Neill said, adding that ""there is no indication yet of how much, if any, would be acquired nor a timeline."".Trump's promise of a strategic reserve and expectations for easier industry regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high at $109,071.86 in January..""This is the most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week,"" Charles Edwards, founder of bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, wrote in a post on X..""No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the Govt.

It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold',"" Sacks said..Trump's moves to support the crypto industry, which spent millions of dollars backing him and other Republicans in the November elections, have drawn concern from some conservatives and crypto backers over giveaways to an already wealthy community and delegitimizing the digital currency industry..Proponents argue that a reserve would help taxpayers benefit from crypto's price growth..Sacks estimated the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin and the premature sale of the cryptocurrency has cost the American taxpayer $17 billion.

2025-03-05,"Tittle:Markets wrestle with Trump's unconventional debt ideas
Article:.NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Investors are weighing whether Donald Trump might turn to unconventional ideas to try to bring the ballooning U.S. debt under control, after the president insisted he won't cut popular health and retirement benefits..Some of Trump's advisers have espoused unorthodox ideas in recent months, including forcing foreign governments to swap Treasuries for cheaper bonds in order to reduce interest payments and selling residency cards to rich foreigners at $5 million a pop..With many officials and economists saying that U.S. debt is on an unsustainable path, investors in U.S. bonds, currency and equities markets are starting to pay more attention to these ideas..U.S. debt stands at $36 trillion, or more than 120% of annual economic output (GDP), and is rising fast as the government spends more than it raises in taxes. Last year, the U.S. budget deficit topped 6% of GDP - though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he wants to halve that..Trump's new administration has launched aggressive moves to cut federal spending through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). And it has announced plans to raise additional revenue by imposingheavy tariffson imports from trade partners including China, Mexico and Canada..More than half a dozen investors and economists told Reuters the outcome of those efforts to close the deficit remained unclear. And none of the other outside-the-box ideas would have enough impact to bring the fiscal situation under control, they added..Indeed, a forced debt swap with foreign governments could undermine U.S. credit worthiness and upset the global financial system, they said - torpedoeing Bessent's aim of sharply lowering the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which underpins borrowing costs across the economy..""The prospect for manipulating a long-term yield through some kind of financial or political engineering operation is very limited,"" said Larry Summers, an economist who served as Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat..An official with the White House's National Economic Council - the principal group of economic advisors to the president - said that ""out-of-the-box thinking is exactly what is required,"" blaming the previous Democratic administration for adding to deficits and causing inflation..Trump, the official said, had moved quickly to ""restore fiscal sanity."".The official said a fall in long-term U.S. interest rates in recent weeks was a sign of market confidence in Trump's policies. As further evidence, the official pointed to a decline in the term premium, which measures what investors charge for holding debt for a longer period of time..After Trump's election in November, investors had sold off government bonds amid concerns that his policies - including tax cuts and tariffs - would cause the U.S. deficit to worsen and put the economy on an inflationary path..But since mid-January, a few days before Trump's inauguration, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have fallen dramatically. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, has dropped to around 4.2%..The term premium, which in part reflects investors' feelings about the future size of the debt, has also declined, but it remains firmly in positive territory after being negative for years..Some investors, however, argue that yields have fallen not because of optimism around the U.S. fiscal trajectory but because Trump's policies have increased economic uncertainty - hitting consumer and business confidence, and leading to talk ofslower or negative growth..Those worries areshowing in stock pricesas well, some investors said. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500(.SPX), opens new tabhas fallen over 4% since Trump's return to the White House on January 20 against a roughly 1.3% decline for an MSCI index of stocks in more than 40 other countries..Niladri Mukherjee, chief investment officer at TIAA Wealth Management, said a ""spike in policy uncertainty"" may be leading to a soft patch in the economy..""Campaign promises are one thing, but the devil is in the details when it comes to policy-making,"" he added..Whatever the reason for recent market moves, the Trump administration needs to persuade investors its measures to bring debt under control are working. Otherwise, investor disappointment could prompt a resumption of the bond selloff, raising borrowing costs andhindering the administration's ability to pursue its agenda..""The price of bonds, like the price of any financial asset, is primarily determined over time by fundamentals, and the budget deficit is by far the most important fundamental,"" Summers said..In a November paper, economist Stephen Miran, whom Trump has picked to chair his Council of Economic Advisors, raised the possibility that Trump could use the threat of tariffs and the lure of U.S. security support to persuade foreign governments to swap their Treasury holdings for lower-cost century bonds..Miran, who served as an adviser to the Treasury during Trump's first term, wrote the paper before his nomination while working as a senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital Management, an investment management firm. He is yet to be confirmed..The idea was part of a series of measures to increase U.S. competitiveness that Miran called the 'Mar-a-Lago Accord', after Trump's Florida residence. Miran declined to comment to Reuters, pending his confirmation..Such a debt swap could yield roughly $100 billion in interest costs per year, estimated Julian Brigden, president of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, a research firm..While significant, this would be a fraction of the debt burden. Debt held by the public is expected to climb to $52 trillion by 2035 from $30 trillion this year, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office forecasts..But worries about further forced debt swaps could result in selling pressure on Treasuries, driving yields higher, some investors and economists said - increasing the risk associated with the world's safest asset..""Perhaps they could bring political pressure on some people to buy bonds,"" Summers said. ""But it's likely to make other people nervous about holding an asset that is supported by political pressure, which tends not to work forever."".The NEC official said Miran's paper discusses a wide variety of potential options without advocating for any of them, and only Trump could say what he'd adopt..James Bianco, the head of Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research, said Trump has already adopted some measures indicated by Miran, including the use of tariffs as leverage for security agreements and creating a sovereign wealth fund..""I started to realize a lot of the things that are in that paper are happening,"" Bianco said..Another idea floated by the administration is the""gold card"" program, which Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have said could help to shrink the deficit. Trump has said the residency plan has the potential to raise trillions of dollars and help pay off U.S. debt..The projections have been met with some skepticism. Some immigration and wealth advisers say it is unlikely to trigger a major inflow of wealthy global investors because it would open up their global income to U.S. taxes..An additional subject of market speculation is the idea that the administration could try to make use of the country’s gold stockpile..At current market prices, the gold held in Fort Knox, Kentucky and other locations would be worth about $758 billion, but it is valued at only $11 billion on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet due to a 1973 law that set its price, TD Securities, an investment bank, said in a February 20 note..Trump and Musk have said they want to confirm that the gold has not been stolen from the vaults. Bessent has talked about monetizing ""the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,"" but said that a gold revaluation was not what he had in mind..Ed Mills, an analyst at Raymond James, a financial services firm, said Trump might draw on his experience as a real estate developer in any attempt to overhaul the country's debt..""Trump has spent his life reorganizing and refinancing the debt of the Trump Organization,"" Mills said..Trump,by his own telling, opens new tab, nearly went bankrupt in 1990 and was forced to ask dozens of banks to change the terms on their loans and forgive some of his debts -- an event he's held up as proof of his negotiating skills and shrewd thinking..""With Donald Trump you have to expect the unexpected,"" Mills said."

Companies like Nexira, Alland & Robert, and Ingredion buy a refined version of the amber-colored gum, turn it into emulsifiers and sell it to big consumer goods firms..Contacted by Reuters, Ingredion said it works to ensure that all supply chain transactions are fully legitimate and has diversified sourcing since the start of the war to include other countries such as Cameroon..Nexira told Reuters the civil war prompted it to cut its imports from Sudan and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of the conflict on its supply chain, including broadening sourcing to ten other countries..Alland & Robert, Nestle and Coca Cola did not comment. M&Ms maker Mars and L'Oreal did not return requests for comment..Mohammed Hussein Sorge, founder of Khartoum-based Unity Arabic Gum, which served global ingredients makers before the war, said he was offered gum arabic in December by traders in Senegal and Chad..He said the Chad-based traders wanted $3,500 per tonne for hashab gum, a more expensive variety of gum arabic primarily produced in Sudan, for which he would normally expect to pay more than $5,000 per tonne..The sellers could not provide a Sedex certification, which ensures buyers a supplier meets sustainable and ethical standards, Sorge also told Reuters..Sorge did not buy the gum because he feared the low price and lack of documentation was an indication it had been stolen in Sudan or exported via informal RSF-affiliated networks..""Smugglers manage to smuggle gum arabic through the RSF because the RSF controls all production areas,"" Sorge said..Sorge, who fled to Egypt after RSF forces stole his entire gum supply in 2023, shared WhatsApp messages with Reuters showing these gum traders had reached out on five separate occasions, including as recently as January 9..Since October, the RSF banned exports for 12 goods to Egypt, including gum Arabic, in retaliation for what it said was Egyptian airstrikes against the militia..Asked for comment, the paramilitary said it banned what it called smuggling to Egypt because it was not benefiting Sudan..A buyer, who declined to be named for safety reasons, recounted how he also was approached by shadowy gum traders..""I have (acacia) seyal cleaned open quantities ready for shipping,"" read one WhatsApp message, reviewed by Reuters and offering a load of seyal gum, a cheaper gum arabic variety..In subsequent WhatsApp messages, the trader proposed to schedule shipping every two months at a negotiable price of $1,950 per metric tonne, lower than the $3,000 per tonne the buyer said he would expect to pay for this kind of load..In a different WhatsApp conversation with the same buyer, reviewed by Reuters, a different trader said that trucks carrying gum arabic had crossed the Sudanese border into South Sudan and Egypt..In all instances, the gum traders could not provide a Sedex certification, the buyer said, adding that he declined the offers for fear the gum came from RSF-affiliated networks..Before the Sudanese civil war, the raw gum would be sorted in Khartoum and then trucked to Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, to be shipped via the Suez Canal around the world..Since late last year, however, RSF-affiliated gum Arabic started to appear on sale at two informal markets on the border between the Sudanese province of West Kordofan and South Sudan, according to a buyer based in an RSF-controlled area, who declined to be named due to safety concerns..The buyer, a major trader in the West Kordofan area, said traders collect gum from Sudanese land owners and sell them to South Sudanese traders in these markets for U.S. dollars..All of this happens with RSF protection, which the traders pay for, the buyer added..Abdallah Mohamed, a producer who owns acacia groves in West Kordofan, also told Reuters the RSF takes a fee from the traders for protection. The paramilitary group has diversified its interests into gold, livestock, agriculture and banking..South Sudan Information Minister Michael Makuei, who is also the government's spokesperson, told Reuters transport of gum through South Sudan was not the government's responsibility. Calls and messages to Joseph Moum Majak, the minister of trade and industry for South Sudan, went unanswered..The RSF also takes the product to the Central African Republic through the border town of Um Dafoog, the buyer said, adding that some goes to Chad..A wholesale buyer, based outside Sudan, told Reuters the gum was now being exported through Mombasa in Kenya and South Sudan's capital Juba..Arabic gum of illicit origin has also appeared on sale online. Isam Siddig, a Sudanese gum processor who is now a refugee in Britain, told Reuters his warehouses in Khartoum had been raided by the RSF after he fled in April 2023 with three suitcases of gum in tow..A year later, his gum products appeared on sale, still in his company's branded packaging, in an online Facebook group according to a screenshot shared with Reuters."

Companies are going bust at the fastest pace in over a decade..New Zealand's economy was the worst performing in the developed world last year, according to HSBC..Across the Tasman Sea, Australia's economy has fared much better by comparison, with unemployment near record lows, making it once again a hot choice for kiwi jobseekers..Since 1973, Australians and New Zealanders have been able to live and work in either country without restriction..While the number of migrants has ebbed and flowed over the years, the greater job prospects in Australia - particularly in mining and construction - mean the net traffic is mostly westbound..More than half a million New Zealand-born people now call Australia home..To be sure, New Zealand still has more people arriving than leaving, however, net immigration has fallen significantly with 27,100 net immigrants in 2024 from 128,300 in 2023..Although New Zealand wasquick to respondto the pandemic with early border closures and economic stimulus, both actions fanned inflationary pressures and pushed house prices to historic highs..As a result,the central bank hiked interest ratesat the fastest pace in its history while the government rapidly turned off the fiscal spigots, throwing the economy into recession..""We had this kind of double effect of very strong stimulus that was reversed very, very quickly,"" said Shamubeel Eaqub, chief economist at pension fund provider Simplicity..This, Eaqub compares with Australia, where rates never went as high. The Reserve Bank of Australia didn't feel the need tostart cuttinguntil last month..The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, in contrast, confirmed back in November 2022 that it was deliberately trying to engineer a recession. By May 2024, it had accomplished that goal, even as it maintained an expectation it would have to hike further..While the bank promptly changed tack with a rate cut in August, its previously hawkish warnings had already whacked businesses and households..Clouding the central bank's deliberations were thetimeliness and accuracy of official data. In December, Statistics New Zealand undertook significant revisions showing the economy had enjoyed faster growth in 2023 than first thought, but also that it shrank much more violently in mid-2024 than previously estimated..""If we had perfect knowledge, perfect, accurate real-time data, then it would affect how we communicate,"" lamented Paul Conway, chief economist at the RBNZ. ""Unfortunately, it's not physics."".The conservative government's budget last year targeted lower debt and included little new spending to support the economy..Despite spending cuts, lower tax revenue forced the government to give up onachieving budget surplusesin the next five years..The slowing economy has worsened poverty, charities say..A report by the Salvation Army released earlier this month found that 400,000 people needed welfare support, the most since the 1990s. Food insecurity and homelessness have both risen..""I think there's only a handful of occasions when life has been tougher for people than it is today,"" said Murray Edridge, city missioner for Anglican charity Wellington City Mission..""There's talk that there's signs of economic recovery, and that may be correct, but it's not for everyone, and the trickle-down effect of that for the people who are struggling…is a very distant thing,"" he said..Both Treasury and the central bank expect data due March 20 to show the economy grew slightly in the fourth quarter..Conway said while some businesses should start to see improvement, households were unlikely to feel much relief until the second half of this year..Compounding matters, New Zealand's economic productivity is below that of most peers and saddled with high residential property debt..The government, which polls show would struggle to win an election if called today, is pushing policies it says will improve growth such as reducing regulation, supporting mining and investing in tourism..New Zealand finance minister Nicola Willis said last month the challenges need to be met urgently..Lellimo and Ngaru plan to return to New Zealand one day when they are more financially secure.

2025-03-03,"Tittle:How would a US crypto strategic reserve work?
Article:.WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has given a firstglimpseinto what a U.S. cryptocurrency reserve could look like, saying the stockpile would include bitcoin and ethereum and a range of smaller tokens..Trump in January signed an executive order for the creation of adigital asset working groupto explore the possibility of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Trump had directed the group to turn in a report by July addressing criteria for such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies seized by the federal government..On Sunday, he gave more details in apost, opens new tabon Truth Social of the reserve, including the tokens which will be included..Here are some of the issues at hand:.A strategic reserve is a stock of a critical resource that can be released at times of crisis or supply disruptions. The best-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, which was created by an act of Congress in 1975 aftera 1973-74 Arab oil embargo throttledthe U.S. economy. Presidents have tapped the stockpile to calm oil markets during war or when hurricanes hit oil infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico..Canada has the world's onlystrategic reserve of maple syrup, whileChina has strategic reservesof metals, grains and even pork products..Smaller crypto tokens XRP , Solana and Cardano would be included in the stockpile, Trump said. That was the first indication the reserve would hold tokens besides bitcoin..Bitcoin and ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value, will be the ""heart of the Reserve,"" Trump said in a subsequent post..The president gave no explanation in the post for why the other tokens were included..The exact method of creating a crypto reserve remains uncertain. The working group was directed to evaluate potentially deriving a stockpile from cryptocurrency seized through law enforcement efforts..Currently, that stands at around 198,109 bitcoin, worth about $18.5 billion at market prices, according to bitcointreasuries.net. It remains unclear what the legal process would be for moving them out of the Justice Department..Trump has not said if the government would add to that stockpile by buying more bitcoin or other tokens in the open market and the order offers no further specific instructions..The most concrete bitcoin reserve proposal circulating in Washington comes from pro-crypto Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, who personally holds five bitcoins..In July she introduced a bill, yet to gain traction, that would create a reserve operated by the Treasury..The bill envisages that the Treasury would create a program to buy 200,000 bitcoins annually for five years until the stockpile hit one million tokens. This would represent about 5% of the total global supply of bitcoin of around 21 million. The Treasury would fund the purchases with profits on Federal Reserve banks' deposits and gold holdings..The bitcoin reserve would subsequently be maintained for a minimum of 20 years..Lawmakers, opens new tabin around 24 individual U.S. states, meanwhile, have introduced legislation to create their own bitcoin stockpiles. However, the measures have failed in four states including Lummis' own Wyoming..In aJuly speech, Trump suggested a bitcoin reserve would help the U.S. dominate the global bitcoin market in the face of growing competition from China..Other proponents argue that by holding a stockpile of bitcoin, which they say is likely to continue appreciating over the long term, the U.S. could reduce its deficit without raising taxes, strengthening the U.S. dollar..In November, Lummis told Fox Business that her plan would allow the United States to cut its debt in half in 20 years. ""What that does is help us protect ourselves against inflation and protect the U.S. dollar on the world stage,"" she said..A strong dollar would in turn give the United States more leverage over foreign adversaries like China and Russia, proponents say..Crypto skeptics say that, unlike most other commodities, bitcoin has no intrinsic use and is not crucial to the functioning of the U.S. economy..Created in 2008, bitcoin remains too young and volatile to presume its value will continue to rise in the long term, while crypto wallets remain notoriously vulnerable to cyber attacks, they also argue. And given its volatility, any government purchases or sales could have an outsized impact on bitcoin's price..The price impact would be even more pronounced for large purchases of smaller crypto tokens like Cardano and XRP, which generally have much lower trading volumes..The reserve is likely to be a key topic of discussion at the White House's upcoming cryptocurrency summit on March 7."

Article:.A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole..It's been a bumper day for crypto fans after PresidentDonald Trumptook to social media to announce a proposed reserve of digital assets would include bitcoin , ether , XRP , solana and cardano ..Bitcoinis up around 10% while ether jumped 13% before easing back a touch as details of how the fund would work are not clear yet and, presumably, will be outlined at Friday's White House Crypto Summit..Analysts are wondering exactly how the reserve will be funded given the government has $36 trillion of debt, so borrowing to buy crypto would seem a tough sell. Some have suggested the government could use the crypto seized in criminal cases in recent years, though that would only be a paper transfer rather than actual new demand..Also uncertain is whetherTrump's 25% tariffson Mexico and Canada will go ahead on Tuesday, along with an extra 10% on China. U.S. Commerce Secretary Lutnick said on Sunday tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday, but that Trump would determine whether to stick with the planned 25% level, suggesting it was not a done deal..There's also been suggestions Trump might soften the blow if Mexico and Canada agreed to place their own tariffs on Chinese imports and/or the levies might be delayed until April 1 when a study on trade is due to be finalised..The stakes are all the greater as recent U.S. economic data has surprised on the downside, leading the much-watched Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker to swing to -1.5% from +2.3%. Tariffs are essentially a tax on U.S. consumers and analysts assume they would hurt consumption at a time when the States is not looking so exceptional anymore..Just the threat of tariffs saw imports surge in January lifting the U.S. trade deficit to easily its highest on record. Normally that would imply a large drag on GDP from net exports, though analysts said much of the jump in imports could have been non-monetary gold which would not be counted in GDP..Leaving aside the statistical quirks, markets are in no mood for more weak data and a miss on the ISM forecast of 50.5 later today would likely boost bonds at the expense of equities. Markets already have 73 basis points of Fed cuts priced in by January next year, when just a few weeks ago investors had thought one quarter-point cut might be a stretch..It all makes payrolls on Friday even more pivotal, especially as Fed Chair Powell is speaking a few hours after the data is released..Beijing'spossible response to tariffs, should they go ahead, is also an unknown.

Article:.SYDNEY/SEOUL/LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's $5 million so-called 'gold card' visa program is unlikely to trigger a major inflow of wealthy global investors seeking U.S citizenship because of concerns over higher taxes, immigration and wealth advisers said..Trump said on Tuesday he planned toreplacean existing EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, which requires a minimum $800,000 investment, with the gold card plan that would allow U.S. citizenship to foreigners promising to invest in U.S. businesses..Details of the new plan would be released in two weeks, he said..""I do not believe that the current POTUS offer will have a big impact, as getting a green card in the U.S. if you meet certain criteria, is not difficult,"" said Bassim Haidar, a former UK non-domiciled multimillionaire told Reuters..""Paying $5 million for a golden visa and getting taxed on your global income defeats the purpose."".Trump's plan comes at a time when the European Union is putting pressure on member states to withdraw or tighten residency-by-investment programs, which can trigger house price bubbles and bring marginal benefits to GDP, as well as increase the risks of tax evasion and corruption..A 2021 study of EU golden visa programmes by London School of Economics and Political Science and Harvard University researchers found that the funds generated by these schemes represented only a ""miniscule"" proportion of foreign investment with ""negligible"" economic impact..The EB-5 visa was primarily used by Hong Kong and China residents who owned businesses in the U.S. or wanted their children to study in the U.S., said John Hu, founder of Hong Kong-based John Hu Migration Consulting..Raising the investment threshold to $5 million would be deterrent for many Chinese nationals currently accessing the scheme, he added..""The total number of applicants, if the golden visa is going to replace the EB5, will drop significantly,"" Hu told Reuters, adding global tax liabilities were always a concern for rich people..Trump said the gold card program would be open for wealthy people, such as Russian oligarchs, to apply..The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was created by Congress in 1990 to ""stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors,"" according to the USCIS website..""It could be a negotiation tactic to increase the amount of U.S.-bound investment but considering the amount I don't think demand from Korea will increase significantly,"" said Kim Ji Sun, president of Dae Yang Immigration Law Group in Seoul..""It also requires congressional approval so Trump alone cannot decide to eliminate the current EB-5 program. EB-5 is also about investing money so eliminating it wouldn't make sense."".Grace Tang, CEO at Singapore-based Phillip Private Equity, which helps family offices apply for Singapore's global investor program, which gives local residency rights, said U.S. global taxation rules could be a deterrent..Tang, however, said that the U.S. had always been the ""American Dream"" or many potential immigrants from Asia, and many Chinese people who are familiar with the EB5 program would likely apply for the new scheme."

A year ago, theWorld Bank estimatedreconstruction and recovery would cost $486 billion..The sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions and because discussions are only preliminary.

2025-02-20,"Tittle:'Stagflation' fears haunt US markets despite Trump's pro-growth agenda
Article:.Feb 20 (Reuters) - Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump's hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s, even as markets remain upbeat on his pro-growth agenda..The potential return of stagflation, which would pressure a range of assets, has been flagged periodically over the past 50 years but not materialized as a real threat to investor portfolios. While economists and portfolio managers are not ready to say that this time is different, the dreaded scenario has crept back as a key risk for investors in recent weeks, as the prospect of trade wars and punitive tariffs cast a shadow over U.S. growth..""Stagflation has definitely re-emerged as a possibility because we have these policies that could hurt consumer demand even while persistent inflation limits the Federal Reserve's ability to maneuver,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global's fixed income strategies. ""It's not a zero-possibility scenario any more, by a long shot."".A key piece of the stagflation puzzle - inflation that refuses to cool down - lodged more firmly into place earlier this month, when government data showedconsumer prices rose in Januaryat their fastest monthly pace since August 2023, bringing the annual rate of inflation to 3%..The other piece of the puzzle, U.S. economic growth, hangs in the balance, with Trump's tariffs threatening to add inflationary pressure that could tip the scale..""What continues to concern us more than the risk of inflation is stagflation,"" said Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist at Innovator Capital Management. ""There is that sticky base of inflation to contend with but on top of that, tariffs have the potential to slow down the economy by becoming a tax on consumers and weighing on profits and economic growth."".A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed the proportion of investors expecting stagflation - defined by the bank as below-trend growth and above-trend inflation - over the next year stood at a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, with a trade war seen as a low-probability risk, the survey showed..While Trump postponed imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for a month at the beginning of February, he has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and announcedtariffs on global steel and aluminum imports..He has also tasked his economics team with devising plans forreciprocal tariffson every country that taxes U.S. imports, and this week saidhe plans to introduce 25% tariffson autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports..Some investors believe any hit to growth from tariffs would be temporary..Over a longer-term horizon, tariffs could even promote growth, said Maddi Dessner, head of asset class services at Capital Group, boosting industries that will benefit from less competition globally. On the other hand, their initial impact could increase price pressures..""The truth is it's probably going to be somewhere in between those two things,"" she said, adding tariffs were partly why Capital Group now forecasts 10-year Treasury yields at 3.9% over a 20-year horizon, up from a 3.7% forecast last year..Stagflation emerged as a source of anxiety as recently as 2022, when inflation rates spiked and stock and bond prices plummeted, but that scenario did not materialize as inflation eventually eased and growth remained resilient..Many believe that the U.S. economy will once again steer clear of stagflation..So-called core inflation at about 3% remains well below the levels hit in the 1970s, when the annual rate of core inflation averaged about 7%. This time around inflation expectations remain ""anchored"", meaning the long-term inflation picture is not fluctuating wildly with each fresh piece of economic data, said Evercore ISI in a recent note..Still, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned the market may be underestimating stagflation risks. The prospect of large-scale deportations of workers without visas or other work documents, another Trump campaign pledge, also would fuel inflation, he noted..""Tariffs and deportations are a recipe for inflation and hurt growth; both are negative supply shocks,"" he said, adding that negative supply shocks such as a crude oil price surge contributed to 1970s stagflation..Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said the market has been ""complacent"" over the past six months, focusing on Trump's pro-growth policies. He said stagflation-wary investors could sell two-year Treasuries, likely to lose value due to higher inflation, and buy 10-year Treasuries that would benefit in a low-growth scenario..Surging interest in gold , which hit anotherall-time high on Wednesday, suggests some investors are worried, as gold is one of a handful of assets that hold their value in a stagflationary environment, said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors..The other big winner would be cash, said Brandywine's McIntyre, but he added that for now he was holding back from making big shifts to cash-like fixed income instruments..""I'm not there yet,"" McIntyre said."

Article:.Feb 14 (Reuters) - Silver prices hit their highest since late October on Friday, latching on to factors that drove gold to successive record highs, with some analysts suggesting investors in the metal may aim to challenge a 10-year high just shy of $35 per ounce..However some analysts were cautious on the market's trajectory, given higher volatility in silver and a failure to reach similar dizzying heights as gold in 2024..Spot silver was last up 2% at $33 per ounce, having hit its highest level since late October at $33.41. The white metal scaled a more than 10-year peak of $34.87 per ounce on October 22..""Silver's been a laggard, and some would refer to it as the Cinderella metal, because it always misses the ball.

Trump laterdelayedthe tariffs until March..CME gold stocks had seen a sharpergrowthsince November partly because gold is flown around by plane and silver is usually transported by sea or land..""Elevated EFPs continue to draw metal from London into the COMEX, with the threat of tariffs inadvertently accelerating the drain on LBMA inventories towards critical levels,"" TD Securities said..The amount of silver stored in the London vaults fell by 8.6% from December to 23,528 tons in January, worth $23.9 billion, the London Bullion Market Association said last week..The monthly decline was the largest since the LBMA records began in mid-2016..Despite some bullish-looking factors, analysts noted the silver market's propensity to be volatile - injecting a note of caution..""Silver has a long history of higher volatility than gold, and that when gold makes a decisive move, silver's amplitude is usually 2.0-2.5 times that of gold,"" StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell said in a recent note..Prices also looked slightly vulnerable from a technical perspective..""Last year's range was $22-35; unusually wide.

2025-02-14,"Tittle:Trump cuts could clash with Kennedy's long to-do list
Article:.Feb 14 (Reuters) - Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the new U.S. health secretary, has promised to address an epidemic of chronic illness with PresidentDonald Trump'sbacking, but his broad agenda from making food healthier to studying vaccines may clash with government spending cuts..Trump on Thursdayordered the creationof a 'Make America Healthy Again' Commission made up of Kennedy and other secretaries to look at everything from the high rates of autism and asthma in children to how much medicine is being prescribed to them for ADHD or other conditions..Kennedy, a 71-year-old environmental lawyer, has said the government should open up its data, conduct new scientific studies on vaccines and tackle gaps in rural healthcare with artificial intelligence and telemedicine. He has plans to go after food additives, an area regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, one of about a dozen agencies within the $3 trillion U.S. Department of Health and Human Services..At the same time, Republicans are looking to offset extensive tax cuts by slashing the federal workforce. One HHS agency - the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - plans tocut its probationary staff, about one-tenth of its employees, according to the Associated Press..To make a lasting change, as Kennedy has said he wants to do, it takes years and requires technical experts who can change regulations, said Dan Troy, managing director at consulting firm BRG and former FDA Chief Counsel under President George W. Bush..""If you walk in and you fire the people who are best able to help you get regulations done, then not a lot's going to get done,"" Troy said. ""They're going to have to decide, do they want to actually attack the issue of food additives... or do they want to get rid of the people in the food additive division? You can't really do both."".The administration is also targeting Medicaid spending through specific cuts by the agency, two sources with direct knowledge of the government's plans told Reuters. Medicaid health programs are jointly paid by states and the federal government and cover low-income individuals and families..Reform of Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act could free up resources for Kennedy to spend on promoting nutrition, physical activity and social engagement, said Brian Blasé, president of think tank Paragon Health Institute, which is closely aligned with the Trump administration..""It's time to stop wasting so much money on low value government health programs,"" Blasé said..Ameet Sarpatwari, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said there could be tensions between Kennedy and the president's staff on some of these issues, but that he and Trump would be aligned on most policy matters..Joseph Antos, senior fellow emeritus at conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, agreed. ""If there's going to be a problem, it's going to be more about (Kennedy's) personal interests butting up against the heads of somebody in the White House."".Some of Kennedy's allies who supported him throughout his presidential campaign, abandoned last August, said they want him to prioritize transparency of government data, removing ultra-processed food from school lunches and ensuring government health decisions are independent from corporate agendas..“His top priority should be total transparency of all studies that have been used to approve all medical products and all food additives, preservatives, colorings, so that we as a country can use gold standard science to unravel why we continue to have the sickest children of any of the 30 industrialized nations,"" said Tony Lyons, co-chairman of American Values PAC, a super PAC that supported Kennedy's independent presidential campaign..Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group said that the FDA can “with the stroke of a pen,” close a loophole that allows companies to self-regulate ingredients added to food. Nonprofits like EWG argue that the loophole allows potentially unsafe chemicals into food without regulatory review..“If the new administration is truly determined to make America healthier, closing the loophole that lets chemical companies decide which chemicals are safe to eat is the lowest of low hanging fruit,” Faber said..Trump's health order for his new secretary's first day does not mention one of the items Kennedy raised during Congressional testimony - that he would ask for a review of the safety of abortion drug mifepristone..Project 2025, a series of detailed policy proposals put together by hundreds of high-profile conservatives, some of whom Trump has named to his administration, calls for a series of detailed anti-abortion measures like banning abortion pills and withdrawing Medicaid funds from pro-abortion states."

But it has taken longer than typically expected for the regulator to sign off on a listing that could value the company at $50 billion..Reynolds said the FCA made decisions about listings so he was speaking in abstract terms..""Our aspiration should be if there's a business doing a lot of business in the UK, the gold standard for us is regulating from the UK,"" he told reporters after a speech on Thursday..Shein has faced allegations that it uses cotton from China's Xinjiang province, where the United States has accused the Chinese government of human rights abuses.

Shein refutes these allegations..Reynolds said: ""If we have any concerns about any company, the best way to make sure we don't have those concerns in the future is to regulate them here in the UK..""So I don't see (a listing) as a moral hazard or controversial."".Reynolds said he had wanted Unilever to opt for London, where it has its main listing..""We do a lot of work talking to a range of businesses to make sure they understand the political desire for them to come to the UK,"" he said..Pension reforms were one example of the steps the government was taking, he said..""But I feel we will not maybe turn around some of the sentiment until we've got some of those high profile success stories,"" he said.

That followed its biggest annual gain in 14 years in 2024, on a heady mix of strong central bank purchases, geopolitical uncertainties and monetary policy easing..Gold's appeal as a haven from risk strengthened further as newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump turned to tariffs to aid struggling domestic industry, despite the risk of sparking a trade war..When Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminium this week, spot gold hit a record $2,942.70 per ounce..""What we have seen is the change in the motive for safe-haven buying - from being driven by the Middle East uncertainty to the threat and realisation of tariffs,"" said Philip Newman, managing director at consultancy Metals Focus..The scale of last year's growth, which started before the Federal Reserve started easing interest rates, was unexpected, with investors apparently willing to disregard the opportunity cost of holding zero-yielding gold.

""If anything, the recent structural developments these past months have strengthened the bear case for gold,"" she said..Further pointing to potential easing in the rally once the situation with tariffs becomes clear, jewellery demand has been depressed by high gold prices, with discounts offered in key markets India and China..Cartier maker Richemontsaid in Novemberit was having to be ""extremely cautious"" about passing on soaring gold prices in its pricing of watches and jewellery..Emerging marketcentral banks, according to BofA Securities, are at risk of reducing gold buying if domestic currencies weaken on the U.S. tariffs..Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds, which store bullion for investors, have also been relatively quiet, seeing inflows in Europe-listed funds but outflows in North Americain January, opens new tab..From a technical perspective, gold has been in the overbought zone of its relative strength index since the start of February.

2025-02-12,"Tittle:Critical minerals is a meaningless term, needs new definition and strategy
Article:.LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The term critical minerals has become so widespread that it has effectively lost its meaning, as it could be applied to virtually every metal being mined..What is needed is a new definition that differentiates between what is genuinely vital to a country, and what is just something of importance..It also was clear at last week's Mining Indaba 2025 conference in Cape Town that what is critical to one country isn't necessarily of much importance to another..So what is a better definition of a critical mineral?.Simply put, it's a mineral that you don't have and are worried that you won't be able to get in the future..This means that a critical mineral is one that you need, but you don't have domestic reserves, your strong allies also don't have sufficient deposits and you don't control enough of the supply chain to ensure you get what you need when you need it..A mineral in this situation is distinct from what commodity analysts CRU refer to as a core mineral, which is one that you need but you are fairly confident that you will be able to source now and in the future..Why is this distinction important?.From a Western perspective, a core mineral is one that you largely can leave to market forces to supply, relying on private mining companies to explore, develop and produce on commercial terms..However, a genuinely critical mineral is likely to require a different strategy to acquire, such as directly funding new mines, building strategic relationships with host countries and offering offtake agreements that aren't dependant on market prices..China has proven much more adept at targeting minerals it sees as critical, investing in mines and infrastructure in foreign countries and in processing plants at home, thereby locking in control of the supply chain..This has seen China, the world's biggest importer of commodities, come to dominate much of the global supply chain for minerals vital to the energy transition, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earths..It's no surprise that these four are on China's list of critical minerals, but given that China now dominates their production and supply, are they still critical to China?.The answer is probably not, but only because Beijing was strategic, rather than solely commercial, in how it went about ensuring it could ensure supply..These four minerals are also on the critical list of both the United States and the European Union, as are copper, aluminium, antimony, graphite and tungsten..Critical minerals that are on China's list alone include iron ore, gold, potash and uranium..It could be argued that these are indeed genuine critical minerals for China as they are both vital to the economy and ones where Beijing has limited influence over the supply chains..Take iron ore for example. China relies on imports for more than 80% of its needs, and of its imports more than 90% come from Australia, Brazil and South Africa..While there are Chinese shareholdings in some of the companies mining iron ore in these countries, Beijing lacks control over the resources and has in effect been a price-taker for the past two decades..Turning to the United States and Europe, it could be questioned as to why copper is on their critical mineral list, as there is little threat to supply, given much of the world's mined copper is controlled by Western companies in countries that are broadly aligned with the West..The same could be said for aluminium and lithium, and there are questions as to whether cobalt is actually that vital for the energy transition any longer..Nickel is an interesting case, as both the United States and the European Union classify it as critical, but they have done nothing to ensure supply..Rather, they have allowed Chinese-controlled mines and processing plants in Indonesia to dominate the market while those in countries like strong ally Australia are shuttered amid low prices..If nickel was truly critical, it would be logical to ensure the continued supply from allied nations, even if it cost more to do so..Likewise if Western countries are genuinely worried about securing minerals such as graphite, tungsten and rare earths, then they need to amend the ways they go about developing mines..Western mining companies find it difficult to secure long-term funding as they can't guarantee the price to be received in several years' time, when a mine can be built and become operational..This means they lose out to Chinese companies that don't care about the commercial outcomes as much..Western governments also have to become more proactive in engaging countries with resources, using both soft power such as aid programmes and direct benefits such as market access in order to cultivate stronger resource relationships..However, it appears that U.S. President Donald Trump is adopting the exact opposite tactic, abandoning aid and threatening widespread tariffs on allies and enemies alike..The European Union also appears to move at a glacial pace, producing policies and reports on critical minerals but seemingly doing very little to actually go out and develop supply chains it controls..The views expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

Article:.LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Gold's surge to a fresh record high is being fuelled by fears of an escalating global trade war instigated by U.S. President Donald Trump..But behind the froth created by the mercurial U.S. leader, there are structural shifts that are creating a bullish backdrop for the precious metal..Spot gold climbed to an all-time high of $2,942.70 an ounce during Tuesday's Asian trade, eclipsing the previous peak of $2,911.30 set on Monday and marking the eighth record set so far in 2025..Gold has been in an uptrend for the past 16 months, having rallied by 63% since the low of $1,809.50 an ounce on Oct. 23, 2023..The rally has accelerated since Trump was elected in November for a second term in the White House, with an increase of 16% since the low of $2,536.71 an ounce on Nov. 15..Investors are turning to gold as a safe haven amid rising uncertainty as Trump unleashes a variety of trade tariffs and threatens more to come..In the latest announcements, the United States imposed a 25%tariffon imports of aluminium and steel, cancelling exemptions for major suppliers such as Canada and Brazil..Trump has also imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imports from top trading partner China and threatened a 25% barrier on all imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as suggesting new tariffs onimportsof cars, computer chips and pharmaceuticals..The rising U.S. tariffs and then likelihood of retaliation by other countries threatens to slow global economic growth, boost inflation and tighten monetary policy..Investors are responding by buying gold, with money flowing into exchange-traded funds (ETFs)..The largest gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust saw its holdings jump to 27.92 million ounces on Feb. 7, up 1.3% since the recent low of 27.55 million on Jan. 27..While trade headlines are likely driving the current lift in prices, there are other factors that support a bullish narrative..Gold has in the past two decades been largely driven by three factors, with the strongest gains coming when all three were pulling in the same direction..The three drivers are consumer demand in China and India, central bank buying, and investment flows..Perhaps the most important of the three legs of gold's stool in recent years was consumer demand in China and India, which together account for just over half of global consumer demand, according to data from the World Gold Council (WGC)..China's consumer demand for gold was 815.5 metric tons in 2024, which was down 10% from 2023, while India's was 802.8 tons, up 5%..The combined total of the two top buyers was 1,618.3 tons, which is 53% of the world total consumer demand..While China and India still dominate consumer demand, momentum has eased in recent years and it's likely that the two are transitioning from being the driver of the gold price to providing a floor for demand when prices retreat..This leaves the other two legs as the current drivers of the gold price, and both are somewhat less predictable..Central bank buying has been strong for the last three years with WGC data showing net purchases of 1,044.6 tons in 2024..While this was down slightly from 1,050.8 tons in 2023 and 1,082 tons in 2022, it was the third year that central bank inflows were above 1,000 tons..This rate is more than double the annual average of 473 tons between 2010 and 2021, and shows the increasing role of central banks in driving gold demand..However, given that central bank buying is determined by policy rather than market dynamics, predicting its path is difficult..That said, Trump's often erratic and contradictory policies are likely to encourage more countries to build financial reserves outside of U.S. assets like Treasuries, which may keep demand at a high level in 2025..The third leg of investment flows are also driven partly by a desire for diversification, but also by safe-haven flows and as a hedge against inflation..It's here where Trump's policies are likely to prove most supportive of gold, but there is a large caveat as the U.S. president has shown he can pivot rapidly, and this unpredictability is likely to boost gold's volatility this year..The views expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

However, they were replaced with quotas..EU steel producers have seen export volumes to the United States drop by about 1 million tons to 2.2 million in 2019-2024..A major industry concern is that the 15 million tons the United States imported last year from countries other than the EU will be redirected towards the bloc if tariffs are imposed..($1 = 0.9692 euros)"

At almost 5%, annual revenue growth is also higher than pencilled in at the start of the year..Those sorts of profit gains, still brisk economic growth, tight labor markets and rising import tariffs all give the Fed ample cause to pause its credit easing campaign..Powell is likely to indicate that in his testimony later in the day - with markets now only fully priced for one rate cut this year and not before September..While Friday's news of an unexpectedly large pickup in U.S. wage growth last month was one reason for those tempered rate expectations, there were also offsets on Monday.

Article:.Feb 10(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Amanda Cooper..Another week brings another round of tariff surprises from U.S. President Donald Trump. This time, it's a25% dutyon all U.S. imports of steel and aluminium on top of any existing tariffs..Investors are selling off shares in major steelmakers, but so far this has been orderly and price moves have been fairly contained. Tariffs have become part and parcel of the ""Trump 2.0"" operating manual and although they carry the risk of igniting volatility, the market has become a little less hypersensitive to each individual headline..There are clear signs, however, in the commodities world, where physical raw materials actually change hands, that traders are preparing for trouble..The Londongold markethas seen traders scramble to move ingots to New York, which has pushed up short-term borrowing rates, out of fear that Trump could train his sights on precious metals as targets for tariffs - however distant a possibility that is..A similar dynamic has emerged in the copper market in recent weeks..Copper has traditionally been viewed as a good barometer for the health of the underlying global economy, given its ubiquity and hence the ""Dr Copper"" nickname..When the price drops, it is often a sign of trouble that demand is weakening from anywhere from the construction to the electronics industry. Although its track record for predicting recession is not perfect, contractions in copper demand have often preceded slowdowns in global growth..The copper price has rallied to its highest in several months, but analysts say that, right now, this has less to do with optimism over global growth and more with where traders are moving metal to stave off potential tariff risks..In particular, metal is leaving London Metal Exchange warehouses and entering COMEX vaults. Since Trump took office on January 20, stocks of copper in LME warehouses have dropped by 3,600 tonnes, while those in COMEX warehouses have risen by almost exactly that amount..In the meantime, the gap, or spread, between LME and COMEX futures prices has widened to $740 a tonne, its highest in around 35 years, as traders play the arbitrage - selling London futures in favour of buying U.S. ones. When Trump took office, this spread was below $240 a tonne..In a note today, Citi strategists take a look at different ways to trade global tariff risks and the COMEX/LME arbitrage is one of them. Funds have also increased their holdings of COMEX copper futures and options in the latest week..There are other bullish drivers for copper. Crucially, buyers in China, the world's largest consumer, are returning from the Lunar New Year holidays, which is fuelling the rise in prices..For all the correlation between metal demand and the health of the economy, ""Dr Copper"" may not be able to diagnose how severe the hit might eventually be..Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:.* Three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions.* Quarterly results from McDonald's, Loews and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.* AI Action Summit opens in Paris, France"

Article:.A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole..The week started with a now all-too common bang asPresident Trumpused a media scrum on Air Force One to announce 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the U.S., with a promise of yet more reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday..At the same time, China's new retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. came into effect and GermanChancellor Scholzsaid the EU was ready to respond to levies ""within an hour""..Investors sold the usual suspects with the Australian dollar and euro both slipping early, though they have since pared the losses. Wall Street futures also started lower but didn't stay down for long: They are now up around 0.3%. European futures are also holding their nerve for now..Maybe tariffs are losing their shock value, or markets suspect it is all a bargaining bluff and Trump will quickly reverse course. Some analysts argue that Trump is very sensitive to moves on Wall Street and will cave if markets truly tank - another version of the Fed Put..Then again, markets would have to tank first and the current stability in stocks would surely just make him bolder..Trump also made some, frankly confusing, comments on theTreasury marketsuggesting the U.S. debt was not as big as assumed because some of it was ""fraudulent"". That rang some alarm bells as Trump has in the past floated the idea of reneging on the U.S. debt, essentially defaulting..Such a move would be a global financial catastrophe, so analysts assume he would never do it. Yet just a whiff of a hint of a suggestion of such a risk could cause mayhem..No doubt all these questions will be put to Fed Chair Powell when he testifies before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday and he will have to be at his diplomatic best to answer without riling the White House..Wednesday's appearance will also come right after January consumer price data are released, allowing for a real-time reaction from the Fed itself..As an aside, gold hit another all-time high helped by speculation that Trump could slap tariffs on the metal, an odd move given the popularity among some conservative U.S. commentators of what John Maynard Keynes once called a ""barbarous relic""..The tariff talk has sparked a rush for the physical metal in London, Switzerland and Asia to ship to the U.S. ahead of any new levy. Apparently demand has been so great the Bank of England has been unable to keep up, partly due to its antiquated method of releasing its bullion stores, and that's causing a painful crunch in the market. It gives ""liquid gold"" a whole new meaning..Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:.- Appearances by ECB President Christine Lagarde and ECB Board Member Isabel Schnabel, BoE policymaker Catherine Mann,.- EU Sentix investor confidence survey.- NY Fed Inflation Expectations"

2025-02-06,"Tittle:Reuters interview with ECB board member Cipollone
Article:.FRANKFURT, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The following is the transcript of Reuters interview with ECB board member Piero Cipollone. For a main interview story,click here..Q: The ECB has said that the direction of travel for monetary policy is clear, but the timing and extent of moves is not. What does this guidance mean to you?.A: We are moving towards the target. The direction of inflation is clear, despite some small bumps. All incoming information points to a convergence with the target in 2025 and this is what our models are also telling us..Our models include market expectations for the interest rate path, so this convergence with the inflation target is coherent with a declining interest rate path..Everything is of course contingent on the information at the time of the forecasts, and we will have a new forecast round in March. Before then, we’ll get another inflation print, we’ll have more details on the composition of inflation, and all these feed into the model, as do market expectations for interest rates..Q: Does that mean implicitly that you are comfortable with market expectations for further rate cuts as they are embedded in the projections?.A: That was conditional on the information we had in December. I am comfortable as long as that path takes us to the target in the medium term in a sustainable way..Q: What does the data since that December meeting tell you?.A: Overall, I think the direction is the same. I don’t see huge changes in our view, except trade tensions. The overall understanding of where we are going is there, the fundamentals haven’t changed, so I do not expect a big change in direction..Q: One thing that might happen is a trade war with the United States. How would that affect your thinking?.A: It depends on details such as whether we retaliate, precisely what these tariffs are going to be levied on, and how China is affected..If tariffs are imposed on us, the most immediate impact will be on growth..The price of goods will be higher in the United States. Who is going to absorb the cost? It could be that European companies, in order to defend their market share, might be willing to sacrifice a bit of their margin in order to stay in the market. We have seen this many times and European firms have a great ability to adjust. Part of this sacrifice might be recovered through the exchange rate. So, in the end, the overall impact may not be that big..What concerns me more is if President Trump engages in a full trade war with China. This is a more serious threat because China has 35% of the world’s manufacturing capacity. Trade barriers will force China to sell its goods elsewhere and the competition from China could be a serious threat to us. These goods showing up in Europe could have both a deflationary and a contractionary impact because they would crowd out local products..The uncertainty is exceptionally high, everything is in motion. And we can’t assess where it’s all going until things fall in place..It’s true we have a goods surplus with the United States. But if you add in services and look at the overall current account, then the balance is close to zero..Q: Looking at the very short term, can you support a rate cut in March, as some of your colleagues are already saying?.A: I don’t want to seem elusive, but the uncertainty is so high that anything can happen. We all agree there is still room for adjusting rates downwards. But we need to be extremely careful. It’s important to stress this idea of a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach. I want to enter the meeting with an open mind, see the staff assessment and process incoming data..But we also all agree that we are still in a restrictive territory..Suppose tariffs on China stay, that’s a huge demand shock. On the other hand, we have energy prices moving upwards. It could be a transitory phenomenon, but what if this is more entrenched?.Q: How far are we from the neutral rate and why has the neutral gone up?.A: When you have an estimate range that is 50 or 75 basis points, then it’s a conceptual tool and doesn’t have much bearing on policy, given the high uncertainty. Take estimates that it is between 1.75% and 2.25%. Those are two completely different monetary policies, if you are close to target. It’s such a wide range that one number could imply that you are undershooting and another that you are overshooting. So “neutral” is a very powerful analytical concept but not terribly useful for setting monetary policy, given this embedded uncertainty..It’s possible this rate went up but it’s also possible it stayed unchanged given how wide the band is..Q: You say you are clearly restrictive now. Would that still apply after the next cut? When does the debate start on when restrictive ends?.A: We are almost on target. The closer you get to target, the less you’ll need to stay restrictive..It’s also true we have been overly optimistic on growth and had to cut our growth forecasts three times since June. So, it is possible that the recovery is not as strong as expected and thus the inflationary pressure coming from demand is weaker..This could prompt us to reassess our concept of restrictiveness..Q: Could this mean that you need to become accommodative to avoid an undershoot?.A: I assess the risk around inflation to be balanced and I don’t have evidence of a possible undershoot. Long-term inflation expectations are also very well anchored..The latest information, especially the rise in the cost of energy, makes me think that we should be prudent. It might be a transitory phenomenon, but prices have risen substantially. Consumer expectations have also gone up a little as they are very reactive to short-term developments..I’m not saying that risks are moving towards being on the upside, but we have no evidence of undershooting either..Q: Do the growth revisions suggest fundamental changes in how the economy functions?.A: Growth has been disappointing, especially because of investments. Consumption may have been less buoyant than we thought, but it remains broadly on the path that we are expecting. The fundamentals for rising consumption are there. Real incomes are increasing, employment is high, inflation is declining and consumer confidence is holding steady..The real problem is investments, and that is only partially linked to monetary policy. The culprit is uncertainty. Investments have been weak since the summer given the overall uncertainty and the direction of trade policy after the US election..My sense is that people are holding out before making important investment decisions. There is of course a cost component related to interest rates. But you see that people are investing just to replace old capital stock..Q: What can the ECB do about it?.We have to take care of the cost component and avoid being unduly restrictive. Our goal should be to have the economy growing close to potential and to contribute to reducing uncertainty as much as possible..Q: Could another targeted longer-term refinancing operation help investments?.A: It doesn’t seem to me that the lack of available funding is the issue. We have seen some tightening of credit conditions but that’s not the key factor here..Last week we were talking about a 25% tariff, today not anymore, and tomorrow we don’t know. All companies are trying to understand where it’s all going so that they can make investment decisions..Q: How does this uncertainty affect the labour market?.There could be some softening of the labour market but overall we have been positively surprised. We went through a huge disinflation process with a very strong labour market..Labour hoarding has two dimensions. One is the cost. Overall, the cost is still relatively low because, by some measures, real wages are still below the pre-pandemic level. The second reason is that firms are afraid of losing skilled labour and this is still the case..The labour market is softening, however. The problem is manufacturing essentially. But even there we see some light at the end of the tunnel. There seem to be some initial signs of recovery in the Purchasing Managers’ Index and the Economic Sentiment Indicator. I was surprised to see that confidence in the construction sector and manufacturing activity have bottomed out, and we see some possible signs of recovery. Services are holding up overall. If there is some softening in terms of demand for labour, possibly there will be a pick-up in productivity which will reduce the unit labour cost overall. We obviously need to monitor it because, with all this uncertainty, we could see a deterioration. But I am not overly concerned about the labour market..Q: Adding up what you said about these modest signs of recovery in manufacturing, does that mean you still believe in the soft-landing narrative and you don’t see a recession?.A: We might not be booming but I am not expecting a recession at all. I think consumption will slowly go up because the fundamentals are there, labour income is growing, the cost of borrowing is declining, inflation is declining, and consumer confidence is basically holding up, so it’s possible that the savings rate will decline from a historic high. So, overall, I think consumption will keep going – and that is a big chunk of the economy. Investment should recover too, as soon as all this uncertainty dissipates. First, one cannot hold back forever: imagine you have a bunch of cumulated investment decisions to make. Even if a small percentage of them go through, it will be a positive and you will see that in investment. Second, less restrictive financial conditions are slowly being transmitted to the cost of financing. And third, in 2025-26 we should see an acceleration in the spending of Next Generation EU funds in Europe..Q: Moving to the digital euro. Could you give us an update?.A: We have started the procurement process and we will be selecting suppliers in June, but the contracts are such that they will only be triggered if the Governing Council decides to issue the digital euro. We have been working on the rulebook and we will be able to finalise it shortly after we have firm EU legislation in place. For example, whether people can have access to one or more wallets will have an influence on the rulebook, so if we don’t have a final legislation, we cannot finalise the rulebook. But it will not take long once the legislation is approved because we have done as much work as possible in the absence of a firm legislation. So the procurement is done and the rulebook is almost done. We are also working with the market to leverage the innovation potential of the digital euro. We think there is huge potential in conditional payments to increase the quality and the menu of the offering on payments..Q: So that is a payment that only happens if a certain condition is fulfilled, right?.A: Today there is only one type of conditional payment and it is based on time: pay this amount to this person on this date. We think we can do better than that. To make sure that this intuition is right, at the end of October, we issued a call for innovation partnerships. We were surprised to receive 100 offers. People want to experiment with new ideas. We will be doing that for the next six months and we will then prepare a report..Q: Would conditional payments require a blockchain? How else would the condition be verified?.A: No, it’s not a matter of blockchain. If you have a way to register the transaction on the ledger through a sort of token, that is a possibility. But technicians tell me you can make a transaction conditional even on a traditional ledger. We are working on that, but the information that I can give you is that we can do better than what we are doing today on conditional payment, regardless of the underlying technology. The technology has a bearing on many dimensions, for example latency and privacy..Q: Could you give me an example of a conditional payment that could be settled in digital euro?.A: For example, if the train is late, today you have to ask to be reimbursed. You could have a solution in which you only pay if the condition is automatically verified..To conclude with where we are in the preparation phase, let me add that since the digital euro is a product, we have to market it. So, we are engaging with focus groups and using surveys to understand how to best finalise the product in order to meet people’s expectations. We are on schedule, so we should be ready to take a decision on moving to the next project phase by November 2025. I don’t know whether at that time the Governing Council will already be able to take a decision to eventually issue a digital euro because that depends on whether we have a legislation at that point. We have been clear that we would not take any decision about the issuance of a digital euro before the legislative act has been adopted..Q: We had expected legislation on the digital euro some time ago. What’s holding up the process? Are you sensing a lack of political will?.A: I wouldn’t say there’s a lack of political will. I think people want to understand the whole process. The European Commission issued legislation in June 2023, then the European Parliament started to work on that, but mentally they were not there because there was an EU election coming up. Everything stopped. They are starting to work on this now so, to be fair to them, they didn’t have much time. By contrast, in the Council of the European Union’s working party, work is progressing. As far as I know, they have gone through all of the legislative proposal and they are now focusing on the issues that still need to be worked out. When both the Council and the Parliament have agreed internally, they will sit down with the Commission and try to finalise the legislation. So, we hope they will be able to reach an agreement internally before the summer. But again, political processes are complex and there are many things on the table. Obviously the sooner the better, but we fully understand their needs. My sense is that there is an increased sense of urgency because of the position that has been taken by the new US Administration. The fact that the US President went in so strong on this idea of promoting worldwide US dollar-denominated stablecoins obviously is a signal. The political world is becoming more alert to this. And it’s possible that we will see an acceleration in the process..Q: Stablecoins are similar to money market funds that people use if they don’t want to go via the banking system, whereas the digital euro, with its holding limit, will purely be a means of payment. Why do you think a digital euro would be a good response to stablecoins?.A: You’re right, for as long as stablecoins are not used as a means of payment. My sense is that they will be. This is worrisome because if people in Europe start to use stablecoins to pay, given that most of them are American and dollar-based, they will be transferring their deposits from Europe to the United States. It may start with peer-to-peer, cross-border transactions. Then an American tourist may be able to use stablecoins instead of using a credit card, for example. So stablecoins can enter the payment space, for example, if they can compete with card schemes by reducing the price for the merchant. We have seen that important payment providers have already issued stablecoins, like PayPal, for example..Q: Turning now to bitcoin, we know that the ECB has got repo lines and swap lines with other central banks. Would the ECB maintain those with a central bank that has bitcoins among its reserves?.A: It’s an interesting question. Fortunately we don’t have to think about that right now because no major central bank is thinking about that..Q: One is hypothesising..A: We would need to do a risk management assessment of that. Let’s see if any central bank enters this space because I don’t fully see the rationale for it. We will assess it at that point in time, if it happens. I am trying to be rational and think about why I should invest in bitcoin or another crypto-asset. The only rationale is if one thinks that the price will always go up. It doesn’t have any underlying value, there is no asset backing it, there is no earning model..Q: On that, it’s a bit like gold..A: The structures of the two markets are completely different: the transparency of the market, the concentration. So, I would be careful about making the analogy. I don’t know how deep the market for gold is, but there are central banks in that market, and not just because of a legacy system. We should not stop at a superficial analogy between gold and bitcoin..Q: Why do central banks invest in gold, other than legacy?.A: It’s in part due to legacy, but gold has intrinsic, commercial and industrial value. Bitcoin does not have any of that..Q: We’ve seen gold and bitcoin make all-time highs at the same time. Or should we say that fiat currencies are making all-time lows?.A: Fiat currencies allow you, among other things, to pay. Good luck trying to pay in bitcoin or gold. Central bank money is the safest asset you can imagine and it's relatively stable in terms of what you can buy with it"

2025-02-05,"Tittle:Trump or BRICS? The quandary for Africa's miners and governments
Article:.CAPE TOWN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Beyond the short-term volatility and uncertainty created by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff machinations, it's likely that the longer-term trend of the world splitting into two trading blocs is accelerating..Stripping away Trump's bluster and often contradictory actions, the message seems to be fairly clear. Trump's view of the world is that you are either with the United States or against it..That presents a dilemma for Africa's mineral rich countries as they want to develop their resources to provide them with the maximum benefit, but they also want to stay largely neutral..But it's increasingly likely that at some level African countries will have to decide whether they are more in the Trump camp, or whether they prefer to do business with the China-led BRICS group..There are risks and rewards under both scenarios, and the circumstances of each African country may cause to lean one way or another..Much of the debate at this weeks Investing in African Mining Conference in Cape Town has effectively been about the best path forward for Africa's miners and governments..The continent is already a major producer of minerals, but it's untapped reserves are the major prize in coming decades, especially if the energy transition accelerates..Africa is richly endowed, with an estimated 20% of global copper reserves, about the same for aluminium raw materials, 50% of manganese and cobalt, 90% of platinum group metals, 36% of chromium, as well as reserves of lithium, uranium, gold and rare earths..But developing its mineral resources has been often too challenging, given political instability and corruption, poor infrastructure, lack of capital and legal frameworks that make long-term investments hard to justify..However, the increasing appetite of the world for minerals, especially to enable the energy transition, is likely to set off a new scramble for Africa, this time Africans will have more say in how it unfolds..Finding the right partners is the challenge for African countries..On the one hand the Western world still offers deep capital reserves, sophisticated equity markets and investors and skills and experience in mining and engineering..But Trump is undermining these advantages with his tariffs and threats to withhold aid and other funding, as well as his habit of turning on traditional allies and flip-flopping policies..The main issue with Trump is his apparent transactional view of the world, in which there must always be a winner and a loser, and he always wants to be the winner..This means getting a mutually beneficial deal from the United States is going to be more difficult while Trump is in office..It was perhaps this frustration that boiled over in the remarks at the Investing in African Mining event, on Monday when South Africa's Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said Africa should withhold minerals from the United States if Trump cuts aid..""If they don't give us money, let's not give them minerals. We are not just beggars,"" Mantashe told the conference, which is also known as Mining Indaba..""We cannot continue to debate these minerals based on the dictates of some developed nations as if we have no aspirations to accelerate Africa's industrialisation and close the development deficit,"" Mantashe said..These comments may be unwise in that they may serve to antagonise Trump, but they may also sharpen some thinking in the West on how best to get access to Africa's minerals..Should Africa be looking more toward China and the rest of the BRICS nations, as the best option to unlock its mineral wealth?.The experience here has been somewhat mixed. While China has been willing to develop mines in Africa, it tends to want to do it mainly using its own people and processes, and it wants to export raw ores and beneficiate them in China..This has limited the benefits to African countries, but there may be an option to use legislation to copy what Indonesia has done in forcing companies to commit to domestic downstream operations as part of access to raw materials..The views expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

Prices hit another all-time high on Tuesday, driven by safe-haven demand after China retaliated with tariffs on the United States in response to President Donald Trump's trade levies..Central banks, a major source of gold demand, bought more than 1,000 tons of the metal for the third year in a row in 2024. The National Bank of Poland was the largest such buyer, adding 90 tons to its reserves, the WGC, an industry body whose members are global gold miners, said in a quarterly report..In the final quarter of 2024, when Trump won the U.S. election, buying by central banks accelerated by 54% year on year to 333 tons, the WGC calculated, based on reported purchases and an estimate of unreported buying..Last year's investment demand for gold rose 25% to a four-year high of 1,180 tons, mainly because outflows from physically-backed gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) dried up for the first time in four years..Indicating a major shift in appetite for different products, investment demand for bars rose 10%, while coin buying fell 31%..""In 2025, we expect central banks to remain in the driving seat and gold ETF investors to join the fray, especially if we see lower, albeit volatile interest rates,"" WGC senior markets analyst Louise Street, said..""Geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty should be prevalent themes this year, supporting demand for gold as a store of wealth and hedge against risk."".Total gold demand, excluding opaque OTC trading, rose 1% to 4,553.7 tons last year, the highest since 2022, the WGC said.

""But it's easy to say that this is not good for growth, it's not good for consumer spending, and it's likely to have a negative impact on earnings."".The tariff developments caused big swings in equities and currencies on Monday, which retraced initial moves after news of the pauses on the Mexico and Canada tariffs..""The threat of tariffs is live and that's unlikely to go away,"" said Michael Medeiros, macro strategist at Wellington Management, adding that the uncertainty could force the firm to explore more tactical, short-term trades..Analysts estimatethat tariffs could drive up inflation while weighing on economic growth and corporate profits. Goldman Sachs strategists said Trump's tariffs announced on Saturday - 25% on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China - would reduce their S&P 500 earnings forecasts by roughly 2-3%, while strategists at BofA Global Research said the earnings hit could be as much as 8%..""If company managements decide to absorb the higher input costs, then profit margins would be squeezed,"" the Goldman equity strategists said in a note on Sunday. ""If companies pass along the higher costs to...end customers, then sales volumes may suffer."".The onset of tariffs raised the risk of an S&P 500 pullback of at least 5% early in the year, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note on Sunday..Strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management on Monday maintained their view the S&P 500 would end the year roughly 10% above current levels, but said ""tariffs are likely to represent an overhang on markets and contribute to volatility, at least until investors gain greater clarity on the path and destination of U.S. trade policy."".The UBS strategists recommended gold as ""an effective hedge"" against geopolitical and inflation risks..Robeco added to its positions in safe havens gold and U.S. Treasuries late last week because of concerns about market complacency with respect to tariffs, said Colin Graham, the firm's head of multi-asset strategies..""We’re in a worse position than we were on Friday,"" Graham said as he watched the initial market reaction unfold on Monday..While the tariff threats lent support to some strategists' current allocations and encouraged others to make changes, many warned against knee-jerk reactions to Trump's announcements..Morgan Stanley equity strategists said the tariffs reinforced their preference for services industries, including financials, software, and media and entertainment, saying in a note on Monday that ""we would expect the market to rotate further toward services given recent trade policy implementation."".Concerns about risks from tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty more broadly have led Manulife Investment Management in recent weeks to move into more defensive equity areas and reduce exposure to riskier high-yield credit, said Nathan Thooft, chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at Manulife..""But we’re advocating for people to remain fairly calm,"" Thooft said. ""This is still very fluid and the reality is we don’t know what the policies will be."".Baker Avenue Wealth Management had been underweight healthcare stocks coming into 2025 but added exposure to the group in recent weeks because it seems to be relatively immune to tariff risk, said King Lip, the firm's chief strategist. Still, Lip said he thinks Trump recognizes the concerns a trade war brings for the economy and markets, so the situation will be ""ratcheted down in a reasonable amount of time."".Indeed, many investors remained doubtful that Trump would allow the tariff dispute to spiral into a full-blown trade war that severely damages asset prices..Spencer Hakimian, CEO of Tolou Capital Management, a New York-based macro hedge fund, said he was not making any changes to his investment portfolio based on the tariff announcements..“Trump is bluffing,"" Hakimian said. ""Fade all the noise."""

Article:.Feb 3 (Reuters) - Two former company executives with inside knowledge of Barrick Gold's operations in West Africa are helping to drive Mali's demands for a payment of around $200 million from the Canadian miner, according to people familiar with the talks..Mamou Toure and Samba Toure, key members of the government's negotiating team, both used to work in Mali for Randgold, a mining company that is now part of Barrick.(ABX.TO), opens new tab.Mali's military-led government, which in December seized three metric tons of gold from Barrick worth about $245 million, had given the miner until Saturday at midnight to respond to its demands, according to two sources familiar with the situation, but the deadline passed without either side announcing a breakthrough..Mali wants Barrick to pay 125 billion CFA francs ($199 million) in back taxes, one of the sources said: if a deal is finalized, it would return the seized gold and release four Barrick executives detained since late November..Barrick has publiclyrejectedthe charges against its employees, without specifying what they are. According to a court document reviewed by Reuters, they include money laundering and financing of terrorism..Barrick did not answer questions about the status of the talks and Mali's mines ministry did not respond to a request for comment..The dispute has ramifications for global miners and other foreign investors who poured billions of dollars into West Africa and are now forced to play by a new set of rules as the military governments of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso seek a bigger share of mining revenues..""The standoff with Barrick is a snapshot of just how far military-led governments in the Sahel are willing to go to compel foreign operators to comply with new regulations that align with their pursuit of resource nationalism,"" said Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst for Francophone Africa at Control Risks..Reuters spoke to more than 20 people - including mining executives, consultants, diplomats and people with direct knowledge of the talks - to form a picture of the negotiations. The sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation..The two Toures are among a small group of key players on the Malian side, which also includes junta leader Assimi Goita and Minister of Finance and Economy Alousseini Sanou, according to nine people familiar with the matter..The men, while they share a surname, are not related. Samba Toure, the older by decades, was the more senior of the two at Randgold, where he was West Africa operations director. Mamou was underground manager for the Loulo mine..But it is Mamou who is now the more influential negotiator for Mali, due in part to his close relationship to the powerful finance minister Sanou, the sources said..It was Mamou's consultancy Iventus that won the contract to audit foreign mining companies in Mali, which led to a new mining code in 2023 and renegotiations of the miners' contracts. Samba now works for him at the consultancy..""It's Mamou who is currently the boss,"" said one person who formerly worked with them both, adding that Samba's experience and technical knowledge was nevertheless crucial in decision-making. ""The decisions come much more from Samba than from Mamou."".In response to Reuters' detailed questions, Mamou said that for decades gold production had not benefitted the people of Mali as it should have. Mali is Africa's second-largest gold producer..""It is only natural that the state asks for a rectification,"" he told Reuters. ""The state has made a great effort to reach an agreement, which is why all the other companies have reached an agreement with the state."".Samba Toure did not respond to a request for comment..The military governments in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are using legal disputes, arrests and nationalisations, as well as threats to deepen their ties with Russia, to assert greater control over their gold and uranium wealth. After seizing power in 2020, Mali's junta pledged to scrutinise its mining sector so the state would benefit more from gold prices running at all-time highs..Some Western miners, like Canada's B2Gold(BTO.TO), opens new tab, reached an agreement swiftly. Others, like Australia's Resolute(RSG.AX), opens new tab, whose CEO wasdetainedwhile in Mali for talks, took longer..B2Gold told Reuters it was now proceedingwith planned investmentsthis year at its Fekola gold complex after reaching the deal. Resolute on Thursday told an investor call that it hoped its deal paved the way for better collaboration with Mali's government as it develops the Syama mine..Ochieng of Control Risks said the negotiations by governments in the region did not mean Western operators were unwelcome. ""Several Western mining companies have been allowed to expand operations and take on new assets provided they comply with the latest regulations and taxation demands,"" she said..Mali's relations with Barrick, however, deteriorated as acrimonious talks dragged on last year. After authorities arrested four Malians working for Barrick in September, the company paid 50 billion CFA francs ($80 million) and they were released. But Mali, which is seeking a total of around $350 million, demanded further payments..Mali represents 14% of Barrick's gold output and the company generated $949 million in revenue from its operations there in the first nine months last year..In early November, Bristow told Reuters the company had offered Mali 55% of the economic benefits from its Loulo-Gounkoto mine complex - similar to an agreement the miner struck with Tanzania about five years ago..But when Barrick did not pay a second tranche, Mali accused the company of breaking its commitments and demanded the remaining sum be paid at once rather than in tranches. It began blocking Barrick's exports in early November..Discounting VAT credits, Mali says Barrick has 125 billion CFA francs left to pay..When no payment came, four employees were detained again in late November and Mali issued an arrest warrant for Barrick CEO Mark Bristow on Dec. 5..Nevertheless, contacts continued behind the scenes. One source who spoke to Barrick senior management told Reuters on Dec. 6 that Barrick was close to paying a second tranche of 50 billion CFA. But no payment was made and the conversations stalled. Formal talksresumedon Tuesday..Freddie Brooks, metals & mining analyst at BMI, a FitchSolutions company, said that under Bristow's leadership Barrick had probably the highest tolerance for operational risk of any major miner..""If they can't negotiate a compromise with Mali's military junta, it won't be for lack of trying,"" he said..Samba Toure quit Randgold around nine years ago after a quarrel in an online meeting with Bristow, who was CEO of that company at the time, according to someone who has worked with both Toures..The rift deepened after Samba handed in his resignation and was not allowed to dispose of his vested Randgold share options, domiciled in London..Mamou Toure had already left Randgold in 2015, following a dispute with Bristow over the use of foreign contractors, one of the sources said..Barrick did not respond to a request for comment on the circumstances of the Toures' departures..When the government announced its plans to audit the mines, Mamou won the consultancy contract with his firm Iventus Mining. It was Samba Toure who directed the audits, two sources said..After Mali created a state-owned mining company, SOREM, in 2022, Samba was named chairman of the board, with Mamou appointed as a director..The influence of the Toures is not unchallenged, however. Last summer, junta leader Goita grew frustrated with the negotiations and brought in the director of state security, Modibo Kone, one of the five colonels-turned-generals who lead the junta, one source said. A second source confirmed Kone's involvement in the talks..On at least one occasion, the finance minister has also taken over negotiations and instructed Mamou to stand down after he went too far in his demands, according to one source familiar with the talks..Five sources said that the mines minister, a technocrat with no ties to the military, has been sidelined. However, Mamou denied that, noting the ministry has two representatives on the negotiating commission. The commission takes its orders from the mines ministry as well as the finance ministry, he said..Mali's finance ministry and presidency did not respond to requests for comment. It was not possible to reach the state security service..With exports banned and Barrick's mines producing up to half a ton of gold weekly, stockpiles were rising in its secure ""gold room"" at the Loulo-Gounkoto mine complex..As of Dec. 27, Barrick held just over 3 tons in its vaults, according to a Jan. 2 court order seen by Reuters, which authorised its seizure..At mid-morning on Jan. 11, a helicopter landed at the mine complex's landing strip unannounced. Four special forces soldiers, a customs agent, two officers of the state mining directorate, and other plainclothes officials disembarked and presented paperwork to Barrick staff authorising them to seize the gold, one of the sources said..""They shipped a first quantity and came back in the evening for a second shipment,"" the source said, adding that it was all over by 7:00 pm..For now, the gold seized from Barrick's mines is sitting in the vaults of thestate-owned Banque Malienne de Solidaritein Bamako. The bank declined to comment..Barrick, which confirmed the seizure of the gold, says it has suspended operations at Loulo-Gounkoto..The Jan. 2 order said the seizure was a preventative measure as part of the charges of money laundering and other unspecified financial crimes that have beenlevelled at Bristowand other Barrick employees under Mali's laws..Barrick is resisting the government's demand to migrate to the new 2023 mining code largely because of increased taxes under the code, two sources said..Pending next year is the renewal of Barrick's mining permit. The government has signalled it could refuse it..One source, who has consulted for the Malian government, said the government was seeking leverage for that negotiation, while the company wanted to clinch a long-term renewal under favourable terms..""I think they don't trust each other, but no one has an interest in a break-up,"" the person said..Some investors, however, are anticipating a tough road ahead for Barrick in Mali, including the possibility the company could lose its assets..""The market has already factored in all the risks on Barrick shares, and the possibility that not much of production is going to come from Mali anytime soon,"" said Martin Pradier, materials analyst at Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corporation, which covers Barrick..($1 = 626.7500 CFA francs)"

Article:.NAIROBI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Africa's development bank is proposing a new 'gold standard' style currency arrangement backed by critical minerals such as cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese and some of the 'rare earths' key to the world's energy transition and electric vehicles..The 54-nation region, which has about 30% of the world's critical minerals reserves, attracts only 3% of global energy investments each year and only 2%, or $40 billion, of worldwide green investments last year, the African Development Bank said..This is partly as a result of the continent's volatile currency markets, said the AfDB, which is proposing a new ""non circulating"" currency called African Units of Account (AUA) which would be underpinned by critical mineral reserves..Africa itself needs to double its clean energy investments to an average of $200 billion a year to both cut carbon emissions and boost vital electricity production..Under the AfDB plan, countries would pool a pre-agreed amount of their proven critical mineral reserves and local currencies could then be converted at an agreed rate..""The idea borrows from the Gold Standard that anchored global currency stability,"" the AfDB said in a new report, without giving a timeline for introducing the currency..The Abidjan-based development bank first floated the idea last year, but this is the first time it has laid out details..""It further builds on the CFA-Euro peg in Francophone countries, which is backed by a pledge of external reserves,"" the AfDB said, adding that a basket of critical commodities would hold its value ""better than any African currency""..There have been moves by emerging market countries to find ways of navigating the risks posed by their dependence on the dollar for trade and other transactions..U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to impose 100% tariffs against BRICS nations if they moved to replace the dollar as their reserve currency..The AfDB argued that the proposed new currency could help African governments attract international money into green energy projects as it would ""mitigate the currency and convertibility risks""..Revenues generated by the sale of electricity in local currencies would be paid to a designated settlement agent, which will then sell the equivalent amount of minerals to generate dollars to pay off any lenders into energy development projects."

Those revenue flows intensified after M23 - the latest in a long line of Tutsi-led rebellions - seized the coltan-rich Rubaya area in April, U.N. experts found..Congo is the world's top producer of tantalum and cobalt, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones, and is also home to significant coltan and gold deposits..""Mineral exports from Rwanda are now over a billion dollars a year,"" said Jason Stearns, a political scientist at Simon Fraser University and former U.N. investigator..""That's about double what they were two years ago.

Comtrade data. Rwanda is not a major gold producer..In addition to exerting administrative control over Rubaya, M23 has also created a monopoly for the export of coltan to Rwanda from the nearby Bibatama mine,U.N. experts saidin a December report. The mine is one of the world's largest deposits of coltan, used in cellphones and laptops..The group collected at least $800,000 per month in taxes on coltan production and trade, according to the report, with Congolese output mixed in with Rwandan production..Jean Pierre Okenda, a Congo-based rights lawyer specialised in extractive industries, said Rwanda was not a member of any international transparency initiatives, making it hard to track its minerals..""There is a lack of transparency of the mining operations and... a lack of transparency of the geological information,"" he said."

They aren't exactly a safe be but investors say they are strong investment destinations this year because they are not in Trump's firing line for tariffs and other policy shifts..Economies like Serbia have the added allure of sturdy growth, while for Ghana, Zambia and Sri Lanka, emergence from debt default allows them to focus on reforms and growth..""The frontier markets are likely to be more insulated than the others, because I don't think that countries like Nigeria or Sri Lanka or Paraguay ... will be a target anytime soon for this administration,"" said Thierry Larose, an emerging market portfolio manager with Vontobel..""They have their own idiosyncratic risk, but they're pretty much immune to the risk-on risk-off affecting the mainstream emerging markets,"" he said, calling them an ""extremely powerful engine of diversification""..For Anton Hauser, senior fund manager with Erste Asset Management, assets such as Serbian local bonds are good bets to capture strengthening economic growth in Eastern Europe..A riskier global climate often sends investors rushing for safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries, gold or German government bonds..The COVID-19 crisis and the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine saw investors ditch frontier markets in their flight to safety; several of them tumbled intosovereign default..But the backdrop might be different with the famouslymercurialTrump's second presidency..Some of the riskiest debt bets - such as Argentine, Lebanese, Ukrainian and Ecuadorean international bonds - outperformed spectacularlylast year..Many expect similarly idiosyncratic stories - driven chiefly by local dynamics - to drive returns again over 2025..""High yield has also done generally pretty well - it's been doing well for a few months now,"" said Nick Eisinger, co-head of emerging markets with Vanguard, adding: ""We still think those are interesting parts of the market."".Like Larose, he cited frontier markets, notably in Africa, as ""unlikely to be systematically influenced by geopolitical or global macro factors""..Investors cited multiple other countries - many of which have struggled to attract foreign cash - including Egypt, Nigeria and the Dominican Republic - as good targets..Zambia,GhanaandSri Lanka, which recently emerged from debt restructuring deals, are also attractive bets this year, they said..But there are some bright spots among larger, non-frontier emerging economies too, such as Turkey and South Africa..Turkeyhas become a popular play for foreign cash since it returned to orthodox fiscal policy in 2023, and recently embarked on a rate-cutting cycle and could benefit from reconstruction in Syria and Ukraine..South Africa, investors said, is less reliant on exporting to the United States, could benefit from falling oil prices and has a mix of commodity exports that could help it weather geopolitical turmoil..""The few trades that... have surprised the last few weeks have been low beta, low correlation trades with the dollar,"" said Marek Drimal, lead CEEMEA strategist with Societe Generale.

Article:.NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - On Sunday, just before Donald Trump's inauguration, crypto investor Mike Dudas bought more than $145,000 worth of tokens from World Liberty Financial, a fledgling crypto company partly owned by the U.S. president..Unlike typical crypto investments, the World Liberty Financial tokens give their holders a vote on decisions about product features and marketing. Crypto tokens such as bitcoin and ether can be used for payments or developing applications..Dudas said he invested because he was friendly with the project's advisers and was excited about their plan to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible. DeFi is a financial network run on crypto, without traditional gatekeepers like banks..""I think they'll appreciate greatly in value,"" Dudas told Reuters, explaining why he bought the tokens. ""I believe a Trump DeFi company can be worth very much and that the public sale price was attractive."".Reuters has identified five others--in locations including Gibraltar and Puerto Rico--who have bought millions of $WLFI tokens, based on interviews and data from Singapore-based blockchain analysis firm Nansen..To identify these people, Reuters reviewed the data from Nansen - which uses algorithms, investigations and user submissions to pinpoint the people behind anonymous crypto wallets. Reuters then confirmed their investments through interviews and analysis of public comments on social media..A primary draw for some of them: the connection with Trump, according to interviews with Dudas and two other investors..World Liberty Financial is ""directly connected to our new crypto president Donald Trump,"" said Sigil Fund, a Gibraltar-based fund whose chief investment officer is one of the investors..The CIO, who goes only by the pseudonym ""Fiskantes,"" spent 40 ether tokens, worth around $130,000 on Wednesday on $WLFI tokens, it said via email..""Fiskantes did ape some WLFI,"" the fund said, using a slang term popular in the crypto world for investing in new projects without doing due diligence..World Liberty Financial was announced just two months before the U.S. election by Trump, his three sons and one of his top advisors, the billionaire real estate businessman Steve Witkoff. The firm has so far raised at least $300 million selling the tokens, known as $WLFI, according to Reuters calculations based on World Liberty's website and its social media posts..Trump’s crypto ventures, includinga meme coinknown as $TRUMP that has become worth $7.7 billion in just a few days, areraising concernsamong ethics experts, market participants and others about the dangers of conflicts of interest and potential of influence over the administration. Trump has long licensed out his name to sell everything from steaks to condos to real estate courses, such as at the now-defunct Trump University..Ethics experts said Trump does not appear to have violated any laws. While federal rules prohibit executive branch employees from being involved in policy issues that will affect their financial interests, that law does not apply to the president or vice president..The Trump administration, the Trump Organization, World Liberty Financial and Steve Witkoff, who is Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, did not respond to requests for comment..So far, Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur who founded the blockchain network Tron, has emerged as the most prominent buyer of the token, spending at least $75 million, according to his posts on X. Sun's purchase into an entity where Trump directly benefits financially has raised concerns aboutpotential conflicts of interestand ethics due to Tron'salleged use by militant groupsand pending charges against him by U.S. securities regulators..The purchases by Tron have come as World Liberty Financial has made its own acquisitions of Tron's token..On Monday, World Liberty Financial said on X that to commemorate Trump's inauguration it had made ""strategic purchases"" of crypto tokens, including TRX, Tron's cryptocurrency..World Liberty Financial now holds 30 million TRX valued at $7.43 million, according to crypto analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. On Wednesday, Sun posted on X: ""In my view, if I have made money in cryptocurrency, all credit goes to President Trump."".Since Sun first purchased the WLF tokens on November 25, and WLF's announcement the next day that Sun was now a World Liberty Financial advisor, Tron's price has increased 29% to 25 cents, although that is far off its December high of 43 cents..World Liberty Financial and Sun did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the recent dealings..Trump and other unnamed affiliates are set to reap 75% of some World Liberty Financial revenues and own about 22.5 billion $WLFI tokens through subsidiaries. The project had by Wednesday sold another 22 billion of its tokens to investors. It is not clear how much of that money, if any, goes to Trump, according to World Liberty's ""gold paper"" listed on its website..Unlike factories and warehouses, the costs in setting up crypto companies is negligible, said Jeff Hauser, director of the nonprofit Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes executive branch employees. ""So political investment is the way to influence it."".Trump said earlier this month he will hand over daily management of his business assets to his children on entering the White House..Asked on Tuesday whether he would continue to sell products such as his $TRUMP coin that debuted over inauguration weekend and that could that benefit himself while president, Trump said: ""I don't know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven't checked it. Where is it today?"".Dudas, who founded crypto media outlet The Block, bought 9.7 million of the tokens at 1.5 cents each, according to blockchain records he shared with Reuters. The World Liberty Financial tokens cannot be resold to other investors..When asked if he worried about the prospect of any conflict of interest, Dudas rejected the idea. ""This is very different from a meme coin in the President's name,"" said Dudas, referring to the $TRUMP coin brandished with an image from the President's assassination attempt. Dudas stressed that World Liberty was about the future of decentralized finance..Once a Democrat but now a registered Independent, Dudas said he donated to Republicans during the last election cycle, citing what he described as the Biden administration's hostility to the crypto industry..The sales of the tokens are recorded anonymously on the blockchain, the public ledger that underpins crypto transactions..Nansen identified a number of other holders which Reuters could not independently confirm. Reuters also could not ascertain the number of individual holders of the token..Tron’s Sun is the largest outside investor in the token, according to this analysis..In 2023, theSEC charged Sunwith fraud linked to crypto trading and hiding payments to celebrities to promote his companies. The case is pending. The Swiss-based entrepreneur has said the SEC charges ""lack merit."" He did not respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment..Another buyer of the tokens is Troy Murray, a crypto entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, according to the Nansen data. Murray bought about 666,000 $WLFI tokens, the data show..In 2023, Murray was hit by the SEC with a cease-and-desist order over a blockchain company he developed for selling complex investments via crypto asset vehicles, in violation of securities laws. The case was settled that year..""I was curious about the legal structure they set up around selling the tokens, and once I had gotten through all the steps I kind of figured, why not?"" Murray told Reuters in a message on X, adding the ""whynot"" emoji."

While perilous, that is less severe than the 4C projected before countries negotiated the 2015 Paris Agreement..Each country's pledge toward the Paris goal is voluntary. Nevertheless, Trump is expected to scrap the U.S.national emissions-cutting planand potentially also Biden-era tax credits for CO2-cutting projects..All of this will ""further jeopardise the achievement of the Paris Agreement's temperature goals,"" Michael Gerrard, a legal professor at Columbia Law School, said..""That has obviously an impact on others. I mean, why should others continue to pick up the pieces if one of the key players once again leaves the room?"" said Paul Watkinson, a former French climate negotiator who worked on the 2015 Paris Agreement..Some U.S. states have said they will continue climate action..Regardless of politics, favourable economics drove a clean energy boom during Trump's first term - with Republican stronghold Texas leading record-high U.S. solar and wind energy expansion in 2020, U.S. government data show..ButTrumphas already taken steps to try to prevent a repeat of that, on Monday suspending offshore wind leases and revoking Biden'selectric vehicle targets..The U.S. produces around 13% of global CO2 emissions today but is responsible for most of the CO2 released into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution..As part of the Paris Agreement exit, Trump on Monday ordered an immediate cessation of all U.S. funding pledged under U.N. climate talks..That will cost poorer nations at least $11 billion - the U.S. government's record-high financial contribution delivered in 2024 to help them cope with climate change..Together, all rich countries' governments combined contributed $116 billion in climate funding for developing nations in 2022, the latest available OECD data show..That does not include the huge climate-friendly government funding Biden rolled out domestically, whose future under Trump is uncertain..Total U.S. climate spending - counting domestic and international, from private and public sources - jumped to $175 billion annually over 2021-2022, boosted massively by the 2022 Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, according to non-profit research group the Climate Policy Initiative..The U.S. is also responsible for funding around 21% of the core budget for the U.N. climate secretariat - the body that runs the world's climate change negotiations, which faces afunding shortfall..The We Mean Business Coalition, which is backed by Amazon and Meta, said Trump's disruption of the U.S. business environment could drive green investment elsewhere..It could ""open the door for other major economies to attract greater investment and talent,"" the non-profit group said..Three investors told Reuters the transition to green energy, including in the U.S., will move forward regardless..One impact of the Paris exit will be to prevent U.S. businesses from selling carbon credits into a U.N.-backed carbon market that could be valued at more than $10 billion by 2030, according to financial information provider MSCI..While no longer able to make money from selling any surplus credits, U.S. companies would be able to buy them on a voluntary basis..U.S. airlines, for instance, could still buy them to meet U.N. aviation climate targets, said Owen Hewlett, Chief Technical Officer at carbon market standard setter Gold Standard..The Paris withdrawal is also an issue for banks and money managers caught between the U.S. climate retreat and pressure from Europe to deliver faster on climate goals there..""U.S.-based asset managers with European clients will need to be like a two-headed Janus,"" Mark Campanale, founder of the non-profit Carbon Tracker Initiative, said. ""Will they risk losing European clients to keep U.S. politicians happy? I doubt it."".Already,U.S. bankshave left a banking sector climate coalition following Republican criticism..That does not absolve them and other multinational companies from needing to comply with strict upcoming European rules for sustainability reporting..Given the patchwork of global climate policies, companies are likely to keep up their climate efforts – but to adoptgreen hushingtactics, he said..That means, Campanale said: ""Do it, but don't publicise it."""

Article:.WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - PresidentDonald Trumpon Monday laid out a sweeping plan to maximize oil and gas production, including by declaring a national energy emergency to speed permitting, rolling back environmental protections, andwithdrawing the U.S.from an international pact to fight climate change..The moves signal a dramatic U-turn in Washington’s energy policy after former President Joe Biden sought for four years to encourage a transition away from fossil fuels in the world's largest economy. But it remains to be seen if Trump's measures will have any impact on U.S. production, already atrecord levelsas drillers chase high prices in the wake of sanctions on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine..""America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth,"" Trump said during his inauguration speech..""And we are going to use it."".Trump later signed executive orders declaring a national energy emergency and withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris climate deal, the international pact to fight global warming. He also signed orders aimed atpromoting oil and gasdevelopment in Alaska, reversing Biden's efforts to protect Arctic lands and U.S. coastal waters from drilling,revoking Biden's target for EV adoption,suspending offshore wind lease sales, andlifting a freeze on LNG export permitting..Trump said he expects the orders to help reduce consumer energy prices and improve U.S. national security, by expanding domestic supplies and also bolstering allies..""We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world,"" he said..Environmental groups have said they intend to challenge the executive orders in court..The Biden administration had seen electric vehicle and wind energy technologies as crucial to efforts to decarbonize the transportation and power sectors, which together make up around half of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions..Biden's administration sought to encourage electric vehicle use by offering a consumer subsidy for new EV purchases, and by imposing tougher tailpipe emissions standards on automakers. It also sought to encourage clean energy technologies like wind and solar through tax credits that have drawn billions of dollars in new manufacturing and project investments..The Democratic National Committee called Trump's day one agenda a ""disaster for working families""..""Killing manufacturing jobs and giving a free pass to polluters that make people sick is hardly putting ‘America first,'"" said Alex Floyd, DNC spokesperson..Trump had said repeatedly during his campaign he intends to declare a national energy emergency, arguing the U.S. should produce more fossil fuels and also ramp up power generation to meet rising demand..U.S. data center power use, a major driver of growing electricity demand, could nearly triple in the next three years, and consume as much as 12% of the country's power to fuel artificial intelligence and other technologies, according to the Department of Energy..Trump's declaration seeks to ease environmental restrictions on power plants to meet that demand, speed up construction of new plants, and ease permitting for transmission and pipeline projects..""It allows you to do whatever you’ve got to do to get ahead of that problem,"" Trump told reporters while signing the order. ""And we do have that kind of an emergency."".Sam Sankar, senior vice president for programs at Earthjustice, a non-profit group which is gearing up to fight Trump policies in the courts, said the declaration of an energy emergency in a non-war period is rare and untested, creating a potential legal vulnerability..The first Trump administration had considered using emergency powers under the Federal Power Act to attempt to carry out a pledge to rescue the declining coal industry, but never followed through..Trump's promise to refill strategic reserves, meanwhile, has the potential to lift oil prices by boosting demand for U.S. crude oil..After the invasion of Ukraine, Biden had sold more than 180 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, arecord amount..The sales helped keep gasoline prices in check, but sank the reserve - designed to buffer the United States from a potential supply shock - to the lowest level in 40 years."

Article:.STILFONTEIN, South Africa, Jan 16 (Reuters) - South African rescuers ended their attempts on Thursday to find anyone left in an illegal gold mine where at least 78 people died during a police siege, as a local volunteer described the horror of extracting their bodies from deep underground..Police had encircled the mine since August and cut off food and water supplies to try to force the miners out so they could be arrested, resulting in what the GIWASU labour union called the worst state-sponsored massacre since the end of apartheid..Since Monday, rescuers have used a cylindrical metal cage to pull up 78 bodies and 246 survivors, some of them emaciated and disorientated, in a court-ordered operation at the mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg..The survivors, who are mostly from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, have been arrested and charged with illegal immigration, trespass, illegal mining and other offences..The police have said they were enforcing a government crackdown on illegal mining and that to have allowed food and water down during the siege would have meant ""allowing criminality to thrive""..Mzwandile Mkwayi, 36, was one of two volunteers from the local township of Khuma, where most of the miners lived, who spent three days going up and down in the cage to bring out the corpses and survivors..""I was scared. Those people were happy to see us, they were very happy. We told them 'we are here to help you, please don't die',"" he told Reuters on Thursday near the opening of the mine shaft..""I put the bodies in the bags with my own hands. It was my first time to see a pile of dead. It will traumatise me for the rest of my life."".Asked why he had volunteered, Mkwayi said: ""Those people are our brothers. We're living with them."".On Thursday morning, the cage was sent down one last time, with a camera inside, which police described as a way of verifying information from volunteers who went down on Wednesday evening and said they could see no one left in the mine..Reuters reporters at the scene saw the cage being lifted out empty and being driven away in a truck..Mannas Fourie, the CEO of a rescue company involved in the operation, said it was possible some of the dead had been left in the vast network of deep tunnels and would never be found..""If somebody got lost, you will never know whether somebody got left behind,"" he told Reuters..Illegal mining cost South Africa over $3 billion last year, according to the mining minister. Typically, undocumented miners move into mines abandoned by commercial miners and seek to extract whatever is left. Some are under the control of violent criminal gangs..Ministers have consistently described the Stilfontein miners as criminals and one spoke of the need to ""smoke them out""..But local community members, civil society groups and labour unions have denounced the Stilfontein crackdown, with GIWASU condemning what it called ""the dehumanisation and criminalisation of these poor, desperate miners""..Thembile Botman, a community leader in Khuma, said local residents had been saying for months that people would die, and the deaths could have been averted had the rescue operation taken place sooner..""The minister said they were going to smoke them out and they did. Congratulations,"" he said, speaking with bitter anger..Throughout the rescue operation, police and contractors operating the cage have not been going down themselves but rather have relied on local volunteers..Police have not explained why they were not going down themselves but Fourie said it was better for the volunteers to go because they knew the miners and could gain their trust..During the siege, police removed a pulley system the miners had previously been using to get in and out and waited outside the opening for them to come out, but community leaders and lawyers have alleged there was no way for them to climb out..The pulley was later restored and removed several times during months of negotiations and legal action, according to civil society advocates and community members involved in supporting the miners..The police have denied blocking the miners' exit and said more than 1,500 miners did get out by their own means between the start of the siege in August and the rescue operation, which began on Monday."

Sabreen gave no indication of timing..Economists view central bank independence as critical to achievelong-term macroeconomicand financial sector stability..While the Central Bank of Syria has always been, on paper, an independent institution, under Assad's regime the bank's policy decisions were de facto determined by the government..Syria's central bank, Sabreen added, was also looking at ways to expand Islamic banking further to bring in Syrians who avoided using traditional banking services..""This may include giving banks that provide traditional services the option to open Islamic banking branches,"" Sabreen, who has served for 20 years at the bank, told Reuters from her office in bustling central Damascus..Islamic banking complies with sharia, or Islamic law, and bans charging interest as well as investing in prohibited businesses such as trading in alcohol, pork, arms, pornography or gambling.

In a letter to the Malian government on Monday, Barrick said the seizure meant it would now be ""obliged"" to temporarily suspend mining operations at the Loulo and Gounkoto mines..The seized gold will be transported to the state-owned Banque Malienne de Solidarite (BMS) in the capital Bamako, two sources said..Barrick shares on the Toronto stock exchange were down 1.9% shortly before the close of trading on Monday..One source said eyewitnesses at the mining complex had described gold being shipped in two separate air force helicopter loads. The second source said the seizure was part of a confiscation order that a judge issued last week..In its letter to the Malian government, Barrick said the seizure of the gold meant it was no longer covered by Barrick's insurance. It added that it was waiting for confirmation that the gold removed from its site had arrived at the Banque Malienne de Solidarite and for proof that the gold held there was insured..In a separate court order, dated Jan. 2 and also seen by Reuters on Monday, Judge Boubacar Moussa Diarra had ordered the seizure of the stock and said Mali's economy ministry claimed the two mines operated by Barrick in the country owed a total of $5.5 billion to the government, a much higher figure than previously estimated..Barrick has been in a dispute with Mali's government since 2023 over a contract based on new mining rules. The row has escalated several times, with Mali detaining senior executives and issuing anarrest warrantfor Barrick CEO Mark Bristow..On Friday, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes registered Barrick's request for arbitration proceedings against Mali, according to public documents..Military governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger are all seeking to renegotiate terms to gain a bigger share of mining revenue at a time when gold prices have hit record highs..Neither Barrick nor the Malian authorities immediately responded to requests for comment..The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss publicly the confidential orders..Barrick said in a note to Malian staff on Sunday that the government had begunenforcing an orderto seize the gold, and warned again that it may have to suspend operations at the complex over the long-running dispute..Jefferies analysts have estimated that suspending production at the mine could cut Barrick's earnings before interest, tax and amortisation by 11% in 2025..Mali had previously demanded about $500 million in unpaid taxes from Barrick, sources told Reuters. Barrick denies any wrongdoing. The company's quarterly earnings report says it did pay $85 million to the Malian government in October..Barrick warned last month of a significant deterioration of conditions at Loulo-Gounkoto, with employees detained without cause and shipments of bullion blocked. The company owns 80% of the mining complex, with the Mali government owning 20%."

""Now, it's off to the races,"" he added..The looming crypto ETF gold rush is about more than just products tied to single coins, however. New derivative products are poised to make their debut within days of Trump's inauguration, and new kinds of multi-asset or hybrid products are waiting in the wings..Several issuers, including Calamos Investments, Innovator ETFs and First Trust, have filed for new funds that would use recently-launched bitcoin ETF options to shield investors from losses on bitcoin itself.

While bitcoin's price more than doubled in 2024, ether lagged that pace, gaining 53%..Because less widely-held coins are still in their infancy, factors that drive returns and volatility aren't always clear, said Todd Sohn, ETF analyst at broker-dealer Strategas..While trading in bitcoin and ethereum futures and futures-based ETFs has existed for several years in the U.S., so far those are the only coins for which a futures market exists. Sohn said the existence of futures trading has given regulators confidence in the breadth and depth of both bitcoin and ether..It also remains to be seen how rapidly Atkins will embrace the most novel of the proposed products, given not only the potential risks but the lingering debate over whether or not these tokens are securities that fall within the SEC's purview..Still, that regulatory uncertainty is not dampening the enthusiasm of the crypto asset-management industry..""The only limit on what products emerge will be human creativity,"" said VanEck's Sigel."

The government this time secured a larger premium over market prices, it said in October..Since the two trading firms are based in the United Kingdom, their successful marketing of the crudes in Europe was expected, Guyana's energy minister Vickram Bharrat told Reuters..""However, there is no preference,"" he said, referring to the markets the government would like its oil to reach..The Exxon-led consortium has three active projects - Liza 1 and 2, and Payara - that were producing around 675,000 bpd late last year following upgrades.

2024-12-20,"Tittle:What are cocoa futures, and how do they work?
Article:.LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Futures markets have seen a record-breaking run in cocoa prices in 2024, a surge exacerbated by the hedge funds that provide much of their liquidity heading for the exit..Here are some facts on futures markets, including how they operate and the main players..Cocoa beans are the vital ingredient in chocolate. The world's cocoa – harvested from the Theobroma cacao tree, native to the Amazon rainforest - is now mostly produced in West African countries, principally Ghana and Ivory Coast, and in Latin America..Many of the world's cocoa beans are bought by large trade houses like Cargill, Olam and Barry Callebaut, which is also a chocolate maker..In Ghana and Ivory Coast, the top two producers, these trading houses pre-buy beans via government contracts ahead of the growing season, with the crop then delivered during the October-to-September growing season..Some traders also process beans into powder, butter and liquor that is used in products from chocolate bars to face cream, and then sell these to chocolate makers..Futures markets play a central role in determining industry-wide prices of commodities. They allow investors to buy and sell contracts to deliver anything from oil and pork to gold and cocoa, at a specified date and price in the future..The market is also used by buyers of the physical commodity – in the case of cocoa that's the traders and food producers - to manage risk..Think of a trader who puts in an order for cocoa beans at a certain price, expecting to sell them or related products at a higher price in the future - a so-called ""long"" position. They need to protect themselves against the risk that prices drop by the time they receive them and they cannot sell at the price they had expected..Traders balance out their exposure by taking short positions in the futures market, in effect betting that prices will fall..Cocoa futures markets are significant. They dictate the prices of physical beans, in turn influencing the price of chocolate bought by consumers, the revenues of cocoa producing nations, and the income received by farmers..Speculators like hedge funds also trade futures. They don't typically touch cocoa beans, but instead try to make money off the rising and falling value of the commodity in financial markets..Some hedge funds use intelligence, like weather data, to work out how supply will cause prices of beans to rise and fall, and make bets accordingly. Others use algorithms and trading systems to determine how risky the market is, and how many bets to take..Hedge funds seek to avoid holding futures contracts to their expiration. That's because when the contract expires it is settled with physical delivery - cocoa beans would be delivered to the fund's doorstep..Cocoa supplies hit an historic low last year. Adverse weather and disease that hit trees in West Africa crippled production. The industry was already struggling with sector mismanagement, smuggling, higher production costs and illegal gold mining..With lower supply of physical beans, prices climbed to historical highs on futures markets. Hedge funds and other speculators began to exit the market, booking profits and avoiding the growing risk from price swings..Ghana, following its disastrous 2023/24 harvest, delayed bean deliveries by a year - the diminished supply increased prices further..Over the past decade, the cash hedge funds and other speculators had pumped into the market had made it easier for cocoa traders to buy and sell futures contracts..As hedge funds withdrew from futures in the first five months of this year, liquidity in the market fell, in turn stoking price swings and adding fuel to soaring prices..On Wednesday, New York cocoa futures prices hit a new record."
2024-12-20,"Tittle:How a hedge fund exodus reshaped global cocoa markets
Article:.LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Behind a record surge in cocoa prices this year, a corner of financial markets that drives the cost of chocolate underwent a seismic shift: the hedge funds that oiled its workings headed for the exit..Confectionery prices, from candy bars to hot chocolate, are heavily influenced by futures contracts for cocoa beans. These financial instruments, traded in London and New York, allow cocoa buyers and sellers to determine a price for the commodity, forming a benchmark for sales across the world..In the middle of last year, hedge funds - a class of investors that use privately pooled money to make speculative bets - started pulling back from trading cocoa futures because price swings in the market were raising their cost of trading and making it harder to make profits..They accelerated their retreat in the first half of this year as cocoa prices hit a record in April, driven by supply issues in West Africa, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the U.S. Commodity Trading Futures Commission (CFTC), which oversees the New York market, and ICE Futures Europe, an exchange that compiles figures for trading in London..""This market became increasingly volatile,"" said Razvan Remsing, director of investment solutions at Aspect Capital, a $9.3 billion London-based fund that uses coding and algorithms to find trades. ""Our system's response was to trim our positions."".Aspect slashed the exposure to cocoa in its Diversified Fund from nearly 5% of its net asset value in January to less than one percent after April, according to a presentation reviewed by Reuters..The departure of hedge funds and other speculators caused liquidity in the market to slump, making it harder to buy and sell, stoking volatility to record highs and fueling the price spike still further..Reuters spoke to a dozen fund executives, cocoa market brokers and traders who said the retreat - described here in detail for the first time — has left lasting strains on the market. That has resulted in greater gaps between the price at which cocoa can be bought and sold, and has prompted some industry players to seek alternative instruments, leaving a lasting impact on the sector..This month, the number of futures contracts held globally at the end of a given trading day - a key indicator of market health known as ""open interest"" - hit its lowest since at least 2014, the global figures show, a sign the futures market overall has shrunk significantly. Data prior to 2014 was not available..On Wednesday, New York cocoa futures prices topped their April peak..The futures market is a crucial cog in the cocoa industry, allowing producers and chocolate companies to hedge their exposure to swings in the price of beans..Futures dictate income for the farmers and low-income nations that produce the world's cocoa - the majority of which comes from Ghana and Ivory Coast in West Africa..Hedge funds and speculators have become bigger players in commodity markets over the past two decades as the value of their overall assets has grown. But, as purely financial investors, they have no need to remain in the market at times of stress..The impact of hedge funds' exit illustrates how reliant trading has become on these lightly regulated funds that increasingly shape financial markets. Reuters has reported this year on how hedge funds are piling into the euro zone's $10 trilliongovernment bond market, drawing regulatory scrutiny, and on their growing sway inEuropean stock trading..Contacted by Reuters, the CFTC declined to comment. A representative for Britain's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said that, in line with its market supervision practice, ""we have been working with trading venues and participants to monitor the orderliness of the market."".Bernhard Tröster, an economist at the Austrian Foundation for Development Research (ÖFSE) in Vienna, who last year co-authored a paper on the growing role of financial actors in commodities derivatives markets, said the withdrawal of hedge funds had helped fuel the crisis in cocoa markets..""When markets became so volatile this year, it was clear how hedge funds and other financial actors have become so important,"" he said..Hedge funds and other speculators' share of the market peaked at 36% in May 2023, the highest in at least a decade, after which their retreat began, the global data calculated by Reuters show..Then, at the start of this year, global cocoa prices soared after top producer Ivory Coast was hit by adverse weather and disease.Number two producer Ghana fared even worse, with smuggling, illegal gold mining on cocoa farms and sector mismanagement added to the mix..In early February, cocoa prices surpassed a previous record high set in 1977. Executives at five hedge funds told Reuters they began to withdraw as volatility grew and the cost of trading increased..When markets become too hot, exchanges require speculators to increase the amount of collateral they put down per futures contract, raising their costs. Lawrence Abrams, president of Absolute Return Capital Management in Chicago, said the cost of trading a single cocoa futures contract soared from $1,980 in January to $25,971 by June..High prices and volatility, combined with falling liquidity, began to affect ""our system's trading and risk management decisions,"" Abrams said, whose fund sold out before prices peaked in April. He declined to detail how much his fund managed, citing regulatory reasons..Many hedge funds promise investors they will not exceed a certain amount of risk, meaning that if a certain market becomes too volatile they have to reduce their exposure..The difference between prices offered and sought for futures, the so-called ""bid-ask spread"", soared following the hedge funds' withdrawal. That has made trading harder: lower liquidity and wider spreads mean traders struggle to execute large trades without moving overall prices..""You need speculators,"" said Vladimir Zientek, a trading associate at brokerage firm StoneX, referring to hedge funds, which are not among his clients. ""Without speculators in the market, you lose a lot of liquidity, which allows for these very wide and erratic market swings."".By mid-April, New York contracts hit a then-record above $12,000, up three-fold from January, prompting hedge funds to sell down their positions..""Trends don't last forever,"" said Remsing at Aspect Capital. ""Stay too long in size and you stand to give back all your gains."".Hedge funds' share of the cocoa futures market dropped to 7% in late May, its lowest in at least a decade, the global data show..One European broker, who requested anonymity to discuss clients' trades, said that panic in the market increased in March and April as liquidity drained away..Volatility in cocoa futures hit an all-time high in May, up five-fold from a year earlier, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)..Daily average price swings that month neared $800, some 15 times the levels of a year earlier, according to a Reuters analysis of figures from market data provider PortaraCQG..For major trading houses that buy and sell cocoa beans - a group that includes Singapore's Olam(OLAG.SI), opens new tab, Switzerland’s Barry Callebaut(BARN.S), opens new tab, and U.S.-based Cargill - the liquidity drain and associated price surge exacerbated themore than-$1 billion dollar hitthey took on their futures positions..The losses came earlier this year after Ghana, following a disastrous harvest in the October 2023 to September 2024 season, delayed delivery on nearly half the beans the nation had pledged to sell, upsetting cocoa traders' futures market strategies..These traders typically use futures to lock in prices achieved for cocoa beans, or to hedge against the risk of falling prices..But that strategy unraveled as Ghana delayed its deliveries. Traders were forced to liquidate, at steep losses, short positions for the month of expected delivery, and take new short positions..The market turmoil has prompted some trading houses and producers to seek alternatives to futures..Australian investment bank Macquarie, a big player in commodity markets, told Reuters it sold over-the-counter products to trading houses, processors and chocolate makers when cocoa volatility hit record levels this year, and demand remains high..One major agri-commodities trader is now using such bespoke contracts, according to a source who requested anonymity citing sensitive commercial relationships. They declined to comment on the magnitude of the business..Such products typically protect buyers against narrower price swings than is possible with futures, limiting their use, a European broker said, declining to be identified to freely discuss clients' activity..Some hedge funds have returned to the market. Along with other speculators that trade using investors' cash, they accounted for 22% of futures trading this month, according to the global data. But buying and selling in the cocoa market's altered landscape has become harder..Zientek, the trading associate at StoneX, said bid-ask spreads can now top 20 ""ticks"" - $200 per contract - compared to about 2-4 ticks before cocoa's rally to record highs..""This makes larger orders tougher to execute without seeing an immediate distortion in the market,"" he said..Daniel Mackenzie, managing director of Cocoa Hub, a UK-based company that sources and sells cocoa beans to artisan chocolate makers, said higher and more volatile prices were forcing small and medium-sized makers to decide between passing costs to clients or reducing product sizes..One chocolate maker he worked with has been shuttered and another sold, he said, without providing further details..As hedge funds exited, short-term investors such as day-traders – which buy and sell assets within a single trading day – have stayed in the market, the European broker and the broker at the agri-commodities bank said..The cohort that includes day-traders this month accounted for 5% of the market, about the same as the start of the year, the global data show..Day-traders cannot fulfill the liquidity-provision role traditionally played by hedge funds, the two brokers said..""I like to call them 'cocoa tourists' - they move in, hold a position for a day or two, then move out,"" the European broker said."

Article:.NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank has no desire to be involved in any government effort to stockpile large amounts of bitcoin..""We're not allowed to own bitcoin,"" Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's latesttwo-day policy meeting, in which policymakers cut rates as expected while signaling a less certain path for monetary policy in the months ahead..In terms of the legal issues around holding bitcoin, ""that's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed,"" Powell said..The Fed chief was addressing the prospect of central bank involvement in the idea of the government building a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve once President-electDonald Trumptakes office..Powell's comments on Wednesday dented the value of bitcoin, which has rallied sharply along with other crypto assets since Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 election on the prospect of a more hands-off government approach to a class of assets that rarely functions as actual money, but is instead largely used as a vehicle for speculation..Trump has suggested he will create a U.S.bitcoin strategic reserve- a concept that has also been widely rejected in Europe..The incoming president has not provided details on what such a reserve would entail, beyond saying its initial holdings could include bitcoin seized from criminals, a stockpile of about 200,000 tokens worth about $21 billion at current prices..Bitcoin has more than doubled this year to more than $100,000 on optimism over Trump's pro-crypto stance. The asset has proven volatile in its 15 years of existence, which analysts say reduces its utility as a store of value or a unit of exchange, key attributes of a reserve currency..Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to create such a reserve, under which the U.S. Treasury would buy 200,000 bitcoins annually until the stockpile reaches one million tokens. The purchases would be funded by Fed bank deposits and gold holdings..Funding a strategic bitcoin reserve would likely require the approval of Congress and the issuance of new Treasury debt, according to an analysis published this week by Barclays. Given the likely ways such a reserve could be created, ""we suspect such a plan would face stiff resistance from the Fed,"" Barclays analysts said..More broadly, Fed officials have been skeptical of securities such as bitcoin as they have also backed away from their own efforts to create a fully digital dollar in favor of allowing the private sector to innovate payments technologies..The Fed's main role regarding cryptocurrencies appears to center on how those assets might affect consumer and banking sector safety..""We regulate and supervise banks and we would want the interaction between the crypto business and the banks ... not to threaten the health and well-being of the banks,"" Powell said on Dec. 4.

The central bank lifted its forecast for expected inflation next year, paving the way for higher interest rates than it previously forecast..Concerns the policies of incoming president Donald Trump could further increase inflation are exacerbating the uncertainty for markets..Stocks have been buoyed by expectations of easier monetary policy and had previously mostly shaken off the steady rise in Treasury yields. But with benchmark yields rising sharply after the Fed meeting, the rate outlook threatens to undermine the momentum for stocks, which are trading at elevated valuations..The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield extended that rise on Thursday, hitting a 6-1/2 month high at 4.54% ..""Rates are the biggest risk for markets from here on out,"" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.

Long-end bonds have also beenshunnedby some investors due to a deteriorating fiscal profile for the United States..But the reduction in projected interest rate cuts combined with a cautious tone by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a press conference following the monetary policy statement left investors wary..""Markets are showing the Fed that they lost a lot of credibility here,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. ""They cut rates, but failed to make out a convincing case for doing so."".Investors said that benchmark yields breaching a key 4.5% level could cause turbulence for stocks and benefit lower-risk alternatives..""Yields are going to become more of a problem,"" said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who projects the 10-year yield will rise to 5% next year..The S&P 500 was recently trading at 22 times earnings expectations for the next 12 months, well above its long-term average of 15.8 times, according to LSEG Datastream..""Since the beginning of 2023, the multiple on stocks has climbed quite a lot, making them not just sensitive but vulnerable to even small changes in"" Treasury yields, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital..Wednesday marked the last Fed meeting before Trump takes office as U.S. president next month. Investors are bracing for Trump's policies to improve economic growth but also be inflationary, including his plans to raise tariffs on trading partners, posing another challenge for the Fed's ability to cut rates..""His policies on paper are inflationary,"" Mullaney said..To be sure, plenty of investors remain bullish on the outlook for stocks, with an economy seen on solid footing and corporate profits expected to rise more than 10% next year..Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, noted that the Fed still expects to cut rates, which is positive for equities. The firm has a S&P 500 price target of 6,600 by the end of next year, about 12% above Wednesday's closing level..""The Fed is still biased towards cutting,"" Draho said.

2024-12-18,"Tittle:Insight: New technology aids Brazil's crackdown on illicit Amazon gold trade
Article:.BRASILIA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - (This Dec. 14 story has been corrected to remove the reference to the share of Brazilian gold exports going to Switzerland, in paragraph 27).Harley Sandoval, an evangelical pastor, real estate agent and mining entrepreneur, was arrested in July 2023 for illegally exporting 294 kilos of gold from Brazil's Amazon to the United States, Dubai and Italy..On paper, the gold was sourced from a legal prospect Sandoval was licensed to mine in the northern state of Tocantins. But police said not an ounce of gold had been mined there since colonial times..Using cutting-edge forensic technology, along with satellite imagery, Brazil's Federal Police said it was able to establish that the exported gold did not come from the Tocantins prospect..Instead, it had been dug up from three different wildcat mines in neighboring Pará, some on protected Indigenous reservation lands, according to previously unreported court documents dated November 2023 seen by Reuters..The prosecution is one of the first in Brazil using the new technology to tackle clandestine trading that may account for as much as half of the gold output of Brazil, a major producer and exporter of the precious metal. Illegal gold mining has surged at thousands of sites in the Amazon rainforest, bringing environmental destruction and criminal violence to the region..Seizures of illegally mined gold have surged seven-fold in the past seven years, according to Federal Police records obtained exclusively by Reuters..Sandoval, who has been released pending trial and continues to preach with his wife at a Pentecostal Evangelical church in the central Brazilian city of Goiania, denies the allegations. He maintains there is no way to establish where the gold was mined once it is melted down into ingots for export..""That's impossible. To export gold one always has to melt it down,"" he told Reuters by telephone..Historically, gold is notoriously difficult to trace, especially once metal from different sources has been melted together, erasing the original signatures. After that, it can easily be traded as a financial asset or be used in the jewelry industry..But investigators say that's starting to change. A police program called ""Targeting Gold"" is creating a database of samples from across Brazil that are examined with radio-isotope scans and fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the unique composition of elements..The technique, long used in archaeology, was pioneered in mining by University of Pretoria geologist Roger Dixon to help distinguish between legal and stolen gold..The program developed in partnership with university researchers includes the use of powerful light beams from a particle accelerator at a Sao Paulo lab to study nano-sized impurities associated with gold, be it dirt or other metals like lead or copper, that help trace its origins..Humberto Freire, director of the Federal Police's recently-created Environment and Amazon Department, said the technology allows scientists to analyze ""the DNA of Brazilian gold."".""Nature has marked the gold with isotopes and we can read these unique fingerprints with radio-isotope scans,"" Freire said. ""With this tool we can trace illegal gold before it gets refined for export."".The program has helped fuel an increase in gold seizures since leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office last year — up 38% in 2023 from 2022, according to government numbers seen by Reuters. New Brazil central bank gold market regulations, including mandatory electronic tax receipts for all trades and tightened monitoring of suspect transactions, have also helped, according to Freire..""We estimate that around 40% of the gold that is extracted in the Amazon is illegal,"" he told Reuters. Brazil exported 110 tonnes of gold in 2020 worth $5 billion, according to official data, ranking among the world's top 20 exporters. Last year, exports were 77.7 tonnes, a drop the government attributes to improved enforcement of illegal mining..Lula's predecessor, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro weakened environmental controls in the Amazon..That triggered a new gold rush in Brazil, spurred by record world gold prices that were driven up bygeopolitical tensions and central bank purchases, led by China..Prices have continued to new highs,tradingat around $2,650 per ounce on Friday..Gold rushes have been a hallmark of mineral-rich Brazil from its Portuguese colonial past. But the latest surge in wildcat mining beginning during Bolsonaro's administration has been unprecedented. Satellite images show there are some 80,000 such prospects today in the Amazon rainforest, more than ever registered before..Once dominated by prospectors with gold pans,artisanal miningin Brazil has become an industrial-scale activity with heavy excavating machinery and million-dollar river dredgers. Criminal organizations fly people, equipment and gold into and out of the region with helicopters and planes that land at clandestine airstrips..Their excavations often leave behind gaping ponds of sludgecontaminated with mercury, used to separate the gold from dirt and other minerals..Last year, thousands of miners who invaded the Yanomami territory, the country's largest Indigenous reservation on the northern border with Venezuela, brought violence and disease that caused malnutrition and a humanitarian crisis among the tribe, prompting Lula tosend in troops..Butmany returnedthis year after the military pulled out. Lula, who has pledged to stamp out illegal gold mining, tried to fight back by deploying special forces of the environmental protection agency Ibama intoIndigenous reservationsand forest conservation parks..Police say cracking down on the organized crime gangs that back the wildcat miners is the next step in staunching an illegal trade that feeds the jewelry industry worldwide..Amazon neighbors, including Colombia and French Guiana, are considering adopting the Brazilian gold analysis method to deal with their illegal gold trade and European governments have shown interest, including Switzerland and Britain, the top importers from Brazil after Canada, police and diplomats said..Brazil accounts for just 1% of gold imported by Switzerland, a global trade hub for the metal, and ""measures are in place to import only legally mined gold,"" a Swiss embassy statement said. The embassy said it has set up a working group with other importing countries to study traceability and anti-counterfeiting tools..A 2022 study by non-profit watchdog Instituto Escolhas found that 52% of the gold exported from the Amazon was illegal, nearly all from protected Indigenous reservation lands or national conservation parks..A vibrant lobby for informal gold mining has survived Bolsonaro in Brazil's Conservative Congress, where pending bills propose legalizing wildcat mining..For now, though, gold samples from across Brazil are being added to a database with the help of scientists at the Federal Police's criminology institute lab in Brasilia, where forensic expert Erich Moreira Lima oversees microscopic scanning of gold nuggets that are kept in a safe..""Now that we have a team set up, we hope to analyze the 30,000 gold samples the Brazilian Geological Service has collected. In a few years, we should have mapped all Brazil's 24 gold producing regions,"" he told Reuters..Geologist Maria Emilia Schutesky and her team at the National University of Brasilia's geosciences lab conduct mass spectrometry scans on gold samples to identify associated molecules, such as lead, to place the gold's origins..""We researchers seek a 100% ability to trace gold, but that is more than what the police needs to prove a crime, which is just to establish that the gold does not come from where a suspects claims it is from,"" Schutesky said."

2024-12-18,"Tittle:How would a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve work?
Article:.WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Bitcoinhit a record high above $107,000on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump reiterated plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, stoking the enthusiasm of crypto bulls. Here's how the plan could work..A strategic reserve is a stock of a critical resource which can be released at times of crisis or supply disruptions. The best-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, which was created by an act of Congress in 1975 aftera 1973-74 Arab oil embargo throttledthe U.S. economy. Presidents have tapped the stockpile to calm oil markets during war or when hurricanes hit oil infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico..Canada has the world's onlystrategic reserve of maple syrup, whileChina has strategic reservesof metals, grains and even pork products..Analysts and legal experts are divided on whether Trump could use his executive powers to create the reserve, or whether an act of Congress would be necessary. Some have argued Trump could create the reserve via an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, which can be used to purchase or sell foreign currencies, and to also hold bitcoin..The reserve could include bitcoin that the government has seized from criminal actors. That stands at around 200,000 tokens, worth about $21 billion at the current price, according to bitcointreasuries.net. Trump suggested in a July speechunveiling his bitcoin reserve planthat this stockpile could be the starting point, although it remains unclear what the legal process would be for moving them out of the Justice Department..Trump has not said if the government would add to that stockpile by buying more bitcoin in the open market. To do that, the government may have to issue debt, although some proponents of a bitcoin reserve say the United States could sell some of its gold reserves and use the proceeds to buy bitcoin..Currently, the most concrete bitcoin reserve proposal circulating in Washington comes from pro-crypto Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, who personally holds five bitcoins, she told CNBC last month. In July, she introduced a bill, yet to gain traction, that would create a reserve operated by the Treasury..The bill envisages that the Treasury would create a program to buy 200,000 bitcoins annually for five years until the stockpile hit one million tokens. This would represent about 5% of the total global supply of bitcoin of around 21 million. The Treasury would fund the purchases with profits on Federal Reserve banks' deposits and gold holdings..The bitcoin reserve would subsequently be maintained for a minimum of 20 years..In his July speech, Trump suggested a bitcoin reserve would help the U.S. dominate the global bitcoin market in the face of growing competition from China..Other proponents argue that by holding a stockpile of bitcoin, which they say is likely to continue appreciating over the long term, the U.S. could reduce its deficit without raising taxes, strengthening the U.S. dollar..In November, Lummis told Fox Business that her plan would allow the United States to cut its debt in half in 20 years. ""What that does is help us protect ourselves against inflation and protect the U.S. dollar on the world stage,"" she said..A strong dollar would in turn give the United States more leverage over foreign adversaries like China and Russia, proponents say..Crypto skeptics say that, unlike most other commodities, bitcoin has no intrinsic use and is not crucial to the functioning of the U.S. economy..Created in 2008, bitcoin remains too young and volatile to presume its value will continue to rise in the long term, while crypto wallets remain notoriously vulnerable to cyber attacks, they also argue. And given its volatility, any government purchases or sales could have an outsized impact on bitcoin's price."

Indeed, shares in the company are up around 6% in pre-market trading already..Crypto has been a major beneficiary of flows in the so-called ""Trump trade"", on the premise that the incoming administration will take a more relaxed approach to regulation in general and with crypto in particular..How a strategic reserve of bitcoin, whose supply is capped at 21 million coins, would work is not clear. Governments own around 13.9% of total supply, according to BitcoinTreasuries, with the United States and China vying for the position of biggest.

The launch of U.S. exchange-traded funds in January linked to the spot price have brought in nearly $35 billion in investment flows, according to LSEG data. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been the largest recipient, with over 500,000 coins, according to BitcoinTreasuries data..BlackRockitself said last week it recommends interested investors allocate as much as 2% of their portfolios to bitcoin, citing, among other things, its potential as a diversifier, given that it tends not to move in lockstep with other major asset classes..Trump said on the campaign trail that, if elected, his administration would commit to keeping 100% of all the bitcoin the government owns or acquires in the future..The snag for crypto devotees is a big reserve would mean fewer tokens for investors to trade. It would also risk creating serious turbulence in the market if the government ever did sell part of that stockpile..Suggestions forhow it might workhave included the Federal Reserve possibly managing the reserves for the Treasury Department, much as it does with gold. Alternatively, a bitcoin stockpile could look more like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where both the president and Congress have varying amounts of control, experts say..Either way, Trump appears keen to display his pro-crypto credentials. He's named former PayPal executive David Sacks as White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies.

Salaries don't increase and so everything is expensive,"" Chura told Reuters at the market in the city that perches in the mountains above Bolivia's political capital La Paz. ""With the excuse that there's no diesel or gasoline, the price of everything has gone up."".Inflation is its highest level in over a decade in Bolivia, which was heralded for its commodities-backed ""economic miracle"" in the 2000s. Now the country faces its worst economic crisis this century with natural gas exports tumbling while the dominant socialist party's spend-to-grow economic model has imploded..Bolivia's gas exports, the key source of foreign income, have halved in the last decade as producers have not found new gas fields to replace those that have been tapped out. Central bank hard currency reserves have drained to nearly zero, which has hit imports of fuel, pushed up prices and strained the boliviano currency..Frustrated motorists often wait in long lines for fuel. Wary investors have pushed bond yields up toward record highs..A black market for dollars, common in crisis-hit neighbor Argentina, has grown in Bolivia for the first time in decades, with savers paying a 60% premium to the official exchange rate..The economic slide has turned Bolivian politics nasty..In June a military faction failed in a dramatic coup attempt.

2024-12-16,"Tittle:Bleak times for copper smelters as conversion fees slump
Article:.LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - An unprecedented collapse in conversion fees spells hard times for the global copper smelting sector..The benchmark smelter treatment charges for next yearhave been setby Chilean copper miner Antofagasta(ANTO.L), opens new taband China's Jiangxi Copper(600362.SS), opens new tab..Smelters such as Jiangxi will receive just $21.50 per metric ton and 2.125 cents per pound for smelting and refining concentrates from Antofagasta's mines to make refined copper..That is a huge drop from this year's benchmark of $80.00 per ton and 8.0 cents and the lowest outcome in at least 20 years..At other times the plunge could have been read as a bullish sign of mine shortfall. But by copper's standards, mine supply has had a relatively untroubled year. Global production is on track to grow by 2.0% in 2024..Rather, the tension is from the other side of the supply-demand equation..Global smelter capacity has expanded too fast, particularly in China. Too many smelters are chasing a finite amount of feed and the competition could intensify in 2025..China's copper smelting capacity will grow from 14.26 million tons in 2024 to 16 million in 2025 and close to 17 million in 2027, Ge Honglin, chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, told a conference in late October..Fierce competition for raw materials to feed all this new capacity has kept spot smelter treatment charges at rock-bottom levels this year..The country's leading producersmet in Marchand agreed to curb output to prevent processing fees from falling further..Any cuts they made were only enough to brake the production momentum. National output still grew by 5.0% year-on-year in January-November, according to local data provider Shanghai Metal Market..That's why the shortfall in mined concentrates has not been reflected in the refined metal segment of the copper supply-chain..Indeed, the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) estimates the global refined copper market registered a 402,000-ton supply surplus in the first nine months of the year..Smelters do not only rely on treatment charges for their revenue..They can make money from by-products such as gold, silver and sulphuric acid. They can tweak payability and payment term clauses to enhance revenues..They can also opt to split their pricing between the annual benchmark in the first half of 2025 and the mid-year benchmark in the second half, although that only works if treatment charges have recovered by then..But smelter ingenuity can only mitigate so much of the ongoing squeeze on margins..China's smelter problems are about to be compounded by expansion in the rest of the world..Smelters are coming online in Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo next year, reducing those countries' exports of mined concentrates..The start-up of the Adani smelter in India means another new buyer in the international concentrates market..The ICSG forecasts mine supply growth to accelerate to 3.5% next year but even that may not be enough to meet smelter demand..Many Chinese smelters can adjust their input mix away from mined concentrates to scrap copper..While China's imports of copper concentrates grew by just 3.2% in the first 10 months of 2024, those of recyclable scrap leapt by 16%..However, the incomingDonald Trumpadministration poses a threat to the flow of U.S. scrap to China. Shipments ground to a near halt in 2019 and 2020 after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs by imposing a 25% duty on U.S. recyclable copper..Trump has again dialled up the tariff rhetoric and Chinese scrap importers are already dialling down their purchases of U.S. scrap, fearing a rerun of the tariff wars..The United States is the second largest supplier of scrap copper to China after Malaysia. Chinese imports of U.S. material totalled 363,000 tons in the first 10 months of 2024, representing almost a fifth of the country's total call on the international market..A simultaneous squeeze on mined concentrates and scrap availability is going to pose a tough challenge for China's smelters in the months ahead..They may not all survive..The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

Despite rising demand from the automotive and industrial sectors, Heraeus anticipates that platinum prices will remain within the $850 to $1,220 per ounce range..However, the report underscores that demand for palladium, which is heavily dependent on the automotive industry, might decline as internal combustion engines lose market share to electric vehicles..This shift could exert downward pressure on palladium prices, with Heraeus projecting a price range of $800 to $1,200 per ounce."

2024-12-09,"Tittle:Argentina's Mr Market Javier Milei wants to make austerity great again
Article:.BUENOS AIRES, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei laid out a bleak vision in his maiden speech a year ago amid an economic crisis. He warned there was ""no money"", pledged shock therapy for the economy and said things would get worse before they got better..The crowd in front of Congress cheered his every word..A year later Milei has managed to pull off a gravity-defying feat: keeping that fervor burning and avoiding tipping the country into fiery protest even as he rolls out severe spending cuts that have crimped the economy and pushed up poverty..The bombastic and shaggy-haired economist, who marks one year in office this week, has seen his star rise globally. He has become a poster child for free markets and the political right, with public backing from Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump..At home he is leading a bold - if risky - experiment, turning Latin America's third largest economy and a key producer of grains, gas and lithium, into a rare live test case of libertarian free-market economics and deregulation..So far, he is defying the odds..Milei's polling numbers are high and rising, monthly inflation has come down from 25% to 3%, markets are soaring and distortions in the currency markets have eased..That is despite the real economy being in reverse, hit by his spending cuts. Central bank dollar reserves have improved but remain in the red and half of Argentina's 45 million people live in poverty..""Milei has made huge cuts, which has generated a major recession,"" said political analyst Facundo Nejamkis from consultancy Opina Argentina. ""And yet, the people who voted for him continue to back him. This is what marks Milei out."".Part of the explanation is what came before..Argentines voted Milei into power last year in a shock election driven by anger at the traditional political parties that have overseen years of recessions, fiscal deficits, debt defaults, currency controls and soaring inflation..That has given Milei more leeway - and time..""We are on the right path ... We came from a difficult situation, the country was in decline,"" said José Bosch, a 40-year-old lawyer in Buenos Aires, adding that prices were beginning to stabilize and salaries regain lost ground..While life was tough, Bosch was willing to wait for growth to pick up..""In my personal situation I can endure this, though I don't know for how long,"" he said. ""What we Argentines are always urgently thinking about is the economy."".Milei's rise from acid-tongued economic pundit to president has shaken Argentina and rippled overseas. His austerity, plans to slash back the state and anti-woke rhetoric have made him a darling of the conservative right and free markets..Trump-backing U.S. Republican Kari Lake recently called Milei a ""heavily caffeinated version of Donald Trump"" at a conservative summit in Buenos Aires. Milei's backers sometimes wear adapted ""MAGA"" hats: Make Argentina Great Again..If Milei succeeds longer-term it could redraw Argentina's political fault lines after years of big government. He could gain more seats in Congress in mid-term elections next year that would boost his ability to push through reforms..His government, however, faces a tough new phase: reviving the stalled economy, ending currency controls that have proved hard to undo, and keeping a lid on popular anger at the high cost of living and cuts hitting pensioners and state workers..""They've taken away medicines from retired people, they've fired over 45,000 government workers and they keep making budget cuts to the lower classes,"" said Claudio Arevalo, a State Workers Association union official at a protest last week..""We will stay on the street until this government decides to change its political and economic path."".Brenda Corbalán, 38, said she and her partner, who work in an orthopedics shop and earn some 800,000 pesos ($790) a month, were having to support her retired in-laws, tightening their belts by taking cheaper bus routes and canceling holidays..""Things have got worse, at least how we see it,"" she said..Argentina, the top global processed soy exporter, a key shale producer and No. 4 for battery metal lithium, has seen a series of would-be saviors fall flat after initial promise. And Milei remains a self-confessed political outsider..However, analysts pointed to a pragmatic streak helping Milei survive. He has won allies from the mainstream conservatives that have let him navigate Congress despite having few seats, put moderates into his Cabinet and softened attacks on trade partners like China despite ideological differences..""He's ended up being much more pragmatic in how he's running things,"" said Marina Dal Poggetto, Buenos Aires-based executive director of economic consultancy Eco Go..A straight-talking style and brash showmanship have also kept him in the spotlight. With big sideburns and shaggy locks, he has performed rock music and dated local celebrities. He still appears with a ""chainsaw"" to represent his cutbacks, now gold-hued with ""Forces of Heaven"" written on it..That has helped mask, for now, the hardship many Argentines face, and Milei's big win has been convincing them that austerity is the tough medicine the resource-rich country needs to turn its fortunes around - and see it in a positive light..""We are coming out of a very bad time, tragic for the country,"" Juan Agustin told Reuters on the streets of Buenos Aires, adding that despite the economic drop he felt optimistic. ""Now we are facing a moment that gives us real hope."""

Article:.A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.If you are wondering how markets have reacted to the stunning fall ofPresident Bashar al-Assadin Syria, the answer is calmly. Gold and oil prices are up around 0.4%, but that's a modest move for such arapid turn of eventsand there are no signs of a rush to safety. Maybe there's just too much going on in the Middle East for traders to know how to react..It would certainly seem to be a bloody nose forRussian President Putinwho has spent years propping up the Assad regime and stands to lose control of his only naval base in the Mediterranean..Moscow claimed to have a deal to keep the base and its Hmeimim air facilities in Latakia province, according to a Kremlin source quoted by Russian media, while Russia's foreign ministry played down any immediate risk. But it was far from clear whether the rebels had agreed to such a deal. The loss of those bases would severely degrade Russia's power projection in the Middle East and Africa..Political uncertainty was also a feature in Asia where South Korean stocks slid anew afterPresident Yoon Suk Yeolsurvived an impeachment vote, only for prosecutors to name him as a subject of a criminal investigation over last week's martial law attempt..South Korea's finance ministry was out early on Monday to reassure markets of all the support they needed, but the won still slipped towards two-year lows and stocks(.KS11), opens new tabshed more than 2%..Sentiment was further strained by a surprisingly sharp 0.6% month-on-month drop in China'sconsumer price indexin November, stoking market mutterings that not enough was being done by Beijing to revive the economy..Chinese leaders are set to spend two days this week in closed-door talks on next year's policy ambitions during the central economic work conference, but the suspicion is that nothing concrete will come of it..Core U.S. inflation figures are due on Wednesday and a result above the +0.3% forecast would challenge the market's confidence in a December rate cut by the Fed. The implied probability is currently at 83% with a further 75 basis points of easing priced in for next year..In that regard, it was a relief that President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday he would not try to replaceFed Chair Jerome Powellupon taking office in January..Of the central banks meeting this week, the ECB is seen cutting by 25 basis points and the BoC by 50 bps. The SNB could also go by 50 bps given how much it has been spending to restrain the Swiss franc. The scale of its intervention to sell francs for euros is likely the reason why the single currency is not testing parity on the U.S. dollar right now..Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:.- Participation by ECB board member Piero Cipollone in Eurogroup meeting.- Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden gives a speech on financial stability.- Euro zone finance ministers meet to assess their Draft Budgetary Plans.- Euro Zone Sentix Index for Dec"

Article:.SEOUL, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Minutes after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on Tuesday night, plunging the country into its worstcrisisin decades, his stunned finance minister knew his priorities: throw everything at defending the currency..By around 11 p.m., Choi Sang-mok, who was among the majority of cabinet memberswho opposed martial law, had set up an emergency meeting at the Seoul Bankers Club, an unofficial meeting place for top policymakers from the central bank, finance ministry and banking and markets regulators..As soldiers stormed the nation's parliament, Korea's top four financial authorities, known as F4, activated an emergency playbook that had been used during past crises, scrambling to head off a crippling selloff in the won before Asian markets awoke..Choi led discussions between the authorities, three people familiar with the meeting told Reuters, with the Bank of Korea responsible for efforts to stabilise the currency..The first announcement came swiftly. South Korea would injectunlimited cashinto markets as needed, the finance ministry said, which pulled the won back from lows last seen in 2009 during the global financial crisis..""It was BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong's idea to put this message out quickly,"" one government official told Reuters, on the condition of anonymity. ""Rhee said it was really important to pre-emptively act, as the news should be a bigger shock to foreign investors than for local people."".In the four decades since South Korea was last under martial law, the nation has weathered several crises and significantly evolved its systems to eschew the strongman politics of the past and focus instead on ensuring economic stability..Lessons from the 1998 Asian financial crisis formed the basis for the playbook. That episode ran deepest for South Korea, a country hugely exposed then to short-term debt and a playground for foreign speculators, forcing it into what many Koreans saw as a humiliating rescue package from the International Monetary Fund. Citizens donated their gold to a depleted national coffer..""We have had many crises. We experienced ups and downs through those crises, including the pandemic, and have a set of tools ready,"" said one Bank of Korea official, speaking on condition of anonymity..The last time Korea's four big agencies intervened this heavily in markets was in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic toppled its export-driven markets..Korea's current struggles with anaemic growth, labour strikes,a budget impasseand the troubles of trade partner China meant authorities were already on heightened alert for sharp currency swings..The won is down 9% this year against the dollar, while the KOSPI index has shed 8%, bothlaggingtheir emerging market peers. Foreign money has been leaving Korea's stock market since August, with outflows in four months topping $14 billion..""They were obviously aware of the fact that there would be a little bit of panic, particularly from foreigners, and so they did the right thing,"" said Jon Withaar, who manages an Asia special situations hedge fund at Pictet Asset Management..""This is now really what governments and central banks do now, when they see these types of events, they just offer unlimited liquidity. That was the playbook in COVID."".Until this week, Choi was one of Yoon's conservative loyalists in the cabinet who served multiple government positions since the president was elected in March 2022, starting as a secretary of the economy division..He advanced to chief economic secretary, a position that allowed him to travel with Yoon around the world, before taking his current job in December 2023..During this week's chaos, Choi was the ""control tower"", sources said, directing the messaging and responses through the next day and even as subsequent developments led to the entire cabinet offering to resign..The detailed contingency plan has a long list of actions to take in every possible market scenario, beginning with the first set of reassuring messages to markets to specific funding and rescue operations, said one former policymaker who handled currency matters in the finance ministry..All the same, martial law was not on the list of possible crises under this plan, other sources said..Choi was at thecabinet meetingYoon convened between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Tuesday to discuss his martial law plans, which government official sources said most members opposed, or expressed concerns about..Just hours earlier, Choi had been at a forum for global and local investors celebrating South Korea's inclusion in theFTSE Russell'sbenchmark WGBI bond index..By 11 p.m. he had summoned his team to the Seoul Bankers Club. Choi was at the venue before everyone else, an official who went to the meeting said..""Finance Minister Choi came from the presidential office cabinet meeting. He was fiercely opposed to this absurd plan,"" said another..Kang Youngkyu, spokesman at the ministry, declined to comment when asked whether Choi had attended the cabinet meeting and opposed Yoon's martial law plans, but said he ""led the F4 meetings around 11 p.m. on Tuesday and reviewed contingency plans with his colleagues throughout the night."".Announcements from the F4 followed in quick succession. The BOK said it will hold an extraordinary monetary policy board meeting in the morning, and the Financial Supervisory Service said it will deploy measures to stabilise markets..By 1 a.m. in Seoul, parliament had declared the martial law decree invalid. The F4 persisted with measures, held overnight meetings with their deputies, met again at 7 a.m. and pledged to keep markets functioning normally while the financial regulator said it was ready to deploy a 10 trillion won ($7.06 billion) stock market stabilisation fund..The plan mostly worked. The won is off its two-year lows and Korea's stock market, one of the emerging world's worst performers this year, has lost just over 2.5% over the past three days..BOK Governor Rhee expressed relief on Thursday..""The good thing is that it could have really worsened how foreigners view (South Korea) if martial law had been in place for a very long time,"" he said at a press conference. ""But this changed in just six hours."".($1 = 1,415.4600 won)"

It does not expect interest rates to go below 4% from their current 4.5%-4.75% range..Continued price pressures due to factors such as geopolitical fragmentation and infrastructure expenditure could weigh on the bond market..""We're watching very closely rate repricing dynamics, we're also watching very closely tariffs announcements that can lead to higher inflation expectations and markets volatility,"" BlackRock Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li said on Wednesday..Investors will likely demand higher compensation to hold long-term government debt to account for inflation and wide U.S. deficits, the institute said. This will put upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices..""We are underweight long-term U.S. Treasuries on both a tactical and strategic horizon – and we see risks to our upbeat view from any spike in long-term bond yields,"" it said..BlackRock prefers U.S. corporate debt over Treasuries, as well as government bonds in other developed markets such as the United Kingdom, where the Bank of England will cut interest rates more than what the market is pricing, the institute said..In stocks, it favors sectors such as tech and healthcare, while it sees assets like gold and bitcoin as alternatives to government bonds to offset stock market declines..BlackRock this weekannounced plans to buycredit investment manager HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion, in a deal that will further its offerings in private credit, a key area of growth for the New York-based asset manager..The institute said private markets can offer exposure to companies driving AI adoption and to infrastructure projects..Amanda Lynam, head of macro credit research at BlackRock, said on Wednesday global private credit assets under management are expected to roughly double to $4.5 trillion by 2030..""We are not at all, in our view, saturated, even in the North American market, which is the largest.

Article:.PETRAPOLE, India, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Guards on either side of a border checkpoint between India and Bangladesh scour vehicles and frisk passengers in a hunt for illicit consignments of gold and drugs, as well as food staples such as sugar, grain and even onions..""We caught smugglers in August who were transporting sugar concealed beneath a layer of sand in their vehicle,"" said an officer of India's Border Security Force (BSF) in the northeastern city of Shillong, who sought anonymity..Despite such efforts, illegal barter trade of gold for food items has surged since mid-2022, as India's export curbs fuelled a vast disparity with prices in Bangladesh, causing combined government revenue losses of billions of dollars..The smuggling distorts India's bullion trade with discounts from official prices, hides unaccounted wealth, and weakens New Delhi's efforts to curb food inflation by limiting exports..At the same time it undermines Bangladesh's import reduction measures aimed at boosting local farmers' production..The practice of smuggling gold to buy grain has persisted even after India, the world's second-largest gold consumer, slashed 9 percentage points from its import duty in July, taking it to the lowest in more than a decade..It is driven by significantly higher food prices in Bangladesh, which traditionally relies heavily on Indian supply..But instead of simply exploiting the price difference between Indian and overseas gold, grey market operators use gold to barter for items such as sugar, wheat, and onions smuggled into Bangladesh..The goods are concealed, said a BSF officer, citing the example of a smuggler in India's West Bengal state, arrested in October with 4.7 kg (10.3 lb) of gold worth 35.1 million rupees ($414,000) stashed in his motorcycle's air filter..He had been offered just 10,000 rupees to ferry 18 gold biscuits into India to pay for food items already smuggled into Bangladesh, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity..On India's border with Bangladesh, the BSF follows a non-lethal policy that reduces deterrence, unlike the western border with Pakistan, where officers carry firearms to block illegal entry, the officer added..Traditionally the biggest supplier of grains to Bangladesh, India imposed curbs on exports of staples such as wheat, sugar, rice, onions and pulses to rein in food inflation from 2022..But gold prices have rallied more than 50% since the middle of that year, encouraging wider activity by grey market operators to exploit the arbitrage opportunity as food prices in Bangladesh spiked as much as 150% over those in India..The gold-for-grain trade flourished as India steadily tightened curbs on food exports over the past two years, said a grains dealer in the eastern city of Kolkata, who spoke on condition of anonymity..More than 2 million metric tons of staples have been smuggled into Bangladesh each year in exchange for gold, up from less than 300,000 tons before India's curbs, officials estimate..""The government limits farm exports to quickly lower local prices. But smuggling weakens that strategy, and farmers end up bearing the brunt of the restrictions,"" said Balwant Holkar, a trader in Lasalgaon in the western Indian state of Maharashtra..Meanwhile, India's illegal imports of about 156 metric tons of gold last year, worth about $9 billion, were up from 100 tons in 2022, the World Gold Council (WGC) says..Nearly a third originated from Bangladesh, say industry and government sources, with the bulk used to settle payments for smuggled grain, the BSF and India's Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials told Reuters..New Delhi lost an estimated $1.6 billion in unpaid taxes last year to gold smuggling, industry officials estimate from WGC data..India banned exports of wheat in mid-2022 and curbed those of white rice and sugar in 2023, while levying high taxes on shipments of onions and parboiled rice..But Bangladesh kept import taxes high, making it even more attractive to smuggle grain across a porous border stretching more than 4,000 km (2,500 miles), said a Dhaka-based grains trader, who sought anonymity as the matter is sensitive..In 2012, when India increased gold import duties, smugglers earned a margin of 54,000 rupees a kilogram, which rose to a peak of 1.3 million rupees in mid-2024, industry estimates show..Despite the July tax cut, margins remain lucrative, at 700,000 rupees per kg..""Even after accounting for operational expenses, grey market operators still realise significant profits,"" said James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints. ""This is why smuggling persists, even after the duty reduction."".Gold refining in India yields very thin margins, but grey market operators offer hefty discounts because they evade taxes, said Harshad Ajmera of wholesaler JJ Gold House in Kolkata..""You can't compete with them,"" Ajmera said. ""You just lose market share."".India's sugar export ban drove a surge in global prices, roughly doubling the price of the sweetener in Dhaka over its price in eastern India, luring grey market players..To pay for items from India, Bangladeshi buyers use cartels to deliver the gold across the border, where Indian suppliers exchange it for cash in Kolkata to start a new trade cycle..After India banned exports, Bangladesh's official imports of raw sugar dropped 25% in the fiscal year ending in June, to 1.386 million metric tons..That gap was bridged with about 450,000 tons of smuggled sugar, mostly paid for with gold, said some participants in official trade..""For the last few years, there's been no shortage of work,"" said an Indian courier living near the border, adding that he got paid immediately on delivering gold from Bangladesh at a day's notice..($1=84.6825 Indian rupees)"

Article:.ASSIN FOSO, Ghana, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Cocoa farmer Joseph Arkoh's vote in Saturday's election in Ghana hinges on one unlikely issue: fertiliser..""All of us farmers are suffering,"" the 56-year-old said, as labourers harvested bright yellow pods on his land deep in the bush. ""When we meet, the fertiliser and chemicals are big concerns."".Following the pandemic, a painful cost-of-living crisis and a sovereign debt default, Ghana's economy is again growing. But the cocoa sector in the world's number 2 producer is in thethroes of a crisis..In an expected close contest between the ruling New Patriotic Party's (NPP)Mahamudu Bawumia,the current vice-president, and former president John Dramani Mahama of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, the votes of cocoa farmers could be decisive. And many of them are angry..""The NPP, they're not for farmers. They're for business,"" said one farmer in a ruling party stronghold, who asked not to be named. ""I am voting NDC."".Previously, he supported NPP..Cocoa farming households, estimated to constitute around 2 million voters, are a heavily courted voter bloc in a country with a total electorate of more than 18 million..As the cocoa sector's problems help to alienate farmers from the government, at least one voter survey hastipped Mahama to win, although detailed polling data is not available in Ghana..""Should the trend in favour of the NPP be reversed due to any disaffection over cocoa, this will reinforce a pattern analysts are observing in the upcoming elections: the NPP losing most of the swing vote,"" said Bright Simons, of the Accra-based IMANI thinktank..On the campaign trail, both leading candidates are after the cocoa vote..""We have helped cocoa farmers. Cocoa farming has become good. We've raised cocoa price,"" Bawumia told growers during a campaign stop last week..His campaign declined a Reuters request for an interview..Ghana's cocoa production peaked in 2021, with output of over 1 million metric tons of beans. But it has been in rapid decline ever since, hitting its lowest level in decades last season..Analysts say climate change and tree disease are responsible, while many farmers also blame the government for failing to clamp down onwildcat gold miningthat has destroyed large parts of the cocoa heartland..The government-set price for farmers has increased under NPP, but Ghana's cedi currency is depreciating as global markets for the chocolate ingredient are at historic highs..That has left farmer incomes lagging global price trends andfuelled smuggling..""The government should be sympathetic,"" said 34-year-old farmer Abubakar Jebril. ""We are just begging that they raise the price."".Much of the farmers' ire is reserved for Cocobod, the state regulator that manages the cocoa sector..Cocobod did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment..Even as production has shrunk, Cocobod's spending has ballooned. Its accounts showed administrative costs more than tripled between 2018 and 2023, sparking accusations of waste and corruption..A 2023 government audit of a programme to rehabilitate roads used to transport cocoa to warehouses and ports found that just 13% of contracts were awarded through competitive bidding..Cocobod awarded contracts worth 18.2 billion cedis ($1.2 billion), or more than six times the programme's budget..At the same time, it rolled back free fertiliser distributions for farmers..""They're pushing all the money to themselves on cars and other things and reduced spending on the farmers,"" Mahama said last week while campaigning in Takoradi, an important cocoa-growing region..Mahama has promised to distribute free fertiliser, improve Cocobod's management, cut administrative costs, and combat illegal mining and smuggling..Bawumia has been less specific but Cocobod, at the International Monetary Fund's behest, has proposed a turnaround plan to reduce costs and increase farmers' share of cocoa revenues..Industry players remain sceptical about either candidate's pledges to reverse the sector's decline..On his farm, Arokoh, who voted for the ruling party in the last election, still hopes that Bawumia and the NPP will address his main concern.

Article:.JACAREACANGA, Brazil, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The involvement of Indigenous people in illegal gold hunting, lured by the prospect of easy money due to record prices, has made Brazil's task of cracking down on wildcat mining in the Amazon far harder, environmental agents and police say..The Munduruku territory, a reservation the size of Switzerland on the Tapajos river, a major Amazon tributary, has become a hot spot for illegal mining, which Brazilian law bans on Indigenous land..But increasingly, Munduruku tribe members are entering the illegal trade that is backed by organized crime..On a recent enforcement operation by Brazil's environmental protection agency IBAMA, agents swooped down in helicopters on muddy tailing ponds to find a camp in a clearing, but the miners had fled, alerted by the noise of the approaching choppers..A pressure cooker on a gas stove was still hot, and dogs barked. The agents destroyed two motors used to pump water through filters to trap nuggets of gold. They said the hammocks and clothing were evidence the miners were Indigenous..Gold mining has brought division within the Munduruku tribe, a majority of whom believe it is wrong, though their leaders say lack of government assistance forces people to seek other ways to deal with poverty..On one recent morning, panhandler Samuel Manga Bal found 60 grams of gold on the river: 20 times his usual daily amount..But his brother Domingo was furious and threatened to kill him if he continued, so he was forced to leave their village..""He wanted me gone,"" said Manga Bal, now living off growing manioc, but intending to return to mining when he can..""I'm going to go back to mining, because things are so bad now. We don't even have coffee, there's no sugar, nothing, no food, just manioc flower."".The reservation is located in the municipality of Jacareacanga, a booming town of 26,000 people, where large 4x4 pickups roar along mostly unpaved streets and shops openly buy gold from miners. Trucks arrive carrying heavy backhoes and uploaders used to dig prospecting ponds..Despite visible poverty, Jacareacanga's per capita GDP is 90,000 reais ($15,157.38), higher than Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest metropolis, a sure sign of the illegal wealth gold mining is generating..Very little taxation is collected, even though the trading of gold is public for all to see in Jacareacanga..President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has pledged to wipe out illegal mining that boomed under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro and has become harder to repress across the Amazon..Evicting miners has become more difficult on the Munduruku territory now that tribe members are looking for gold. Tribal leaders estimate 40% of the gold mining on the reservation is carried out by Indigenous people today..To make matter worse, local police officers have beentaking bribesfrom a gold mining business to turn a blind eye, according to a document seen by Reuters..In a village 10 minutes away by boat, local Chief Jonathan Kaba Biorebu said the way to stop illegal mining is to tap funding for sustainable development. He suggested selling carbon credits to companies seeking offsets for pollution..His village has benefited from a carbon credit deal signed by the local Pusuru Indigenous Association that plans to build 40 wells for drinking water. The association built its offices in the Jacareacanga with carbon credit funding..But Kaba Biorebu is skeptical that carbon credit will become so common as to generate enough income to replace gold mining..The non-Indigenous population of Jacareacanga are all for legalizing the informal mining, known as ""garimpo"" in Portuguese..""The income here is gold mining,"" said general store owner Claudemir Pereira. ""The majority of the population here depends on this, even the indigenous people, many of whom work mine for gold to survive."".The government coordinator for expelling gold mining from Indigenous territories, Nilton Tubino, dismissed legalization and said big mining companies have lobbied against it. A bill to legalize informal mining is stalled in Congress."

Article:.NAIROBI, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Ghanaians go to the polls on Dec. 7 to choose a new president and parliament in an election investors are watching closely to determine how the winner will steer an economy emerging from debt default..The leading contenders to replace 80-year-old President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is stepping down after two terms at the helm of the gold and cocoa-producing country, are former president John Dramani Mahama and current Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia. There are 11 other candidates..The West African nation is at the tail end of a long debt restructuring process in which the government overhauled $13 billion in international bonds in a broader rework aimed at cutting debt by $4.7 billion and providing cash flow relief of $4.4 billion during the current IMF programme running to 2026..While the only outstanding step is a deal with non-Eurobond commercial creditors, investors are already casting their eyes beyond the election to assess whether the winner will sustain the economic reforms required to restore debt sustainability..Mahama, 65, who isleadingin a number of polls, has pledged to try andrenegotiate the terms of the IMF dealto secure more financing. He has promised to amend the law to introduce a public debt ceiling of 60-70% of GDP to prevent over-borrowing..But under his previous presidency in 2012-17, the government increased borrowing to invest in the construction of infrastructure projects like roads. He also faced criticism for electricity shortages and high inflation..Bawumia has campaigned on modernising the economy with digitisation, low taxes and fiscal discipline to lift annual growth to an average of 6%..The 61-year-old has also pledged to cap public spending at 105% of the previous year's tax revenue, introduce a flat rate tax scheme and redirect 3% of GDP of public spending into private hands for the provision of public infrastructure..It is fairly common for leaders coming into office to reach out to the IMF and talk about existing programmes - as was just the case in Sri Lanka..The IMF, lender of last resort to Ghana as it restructures its debt under the G20's Common Framework initiative, says its primary focus is to support the government in restoring macroeconomic stability while enabling debt sustainability and inclusive growth..It has so farapprovedGhana's economic performance under the current $3 billion loan programme..The Fund says there is a possibility of adjusting Ghana's current programme, since IMF-supported reform programmes are developed jointly with governments and reviewed periodically..However, any discussions need to take into account the need to preserve a country's ability to achieve set economic objectives..Whoever wins the election will have to tackle a cost-of-living crisis, widespread unemployment, high costs of living and frequent electricity outages..Mahama's party, the National Democratic Congress, plans to increase government spending in social sectors like health and education if it wins, as well as the infrastructure, to support growth and create employment..Bawumia's New Patriotic Party wants to prioritise economic stability by lowering inflation and attracting more private investments..The next government will face limited choices due to Ghana's high debt burden, Oxford Economics said in a research note. Mahama's promises on the campaign trail to boost the economic circumstances of individuals and households could also be tested by the need to balance his policies against IMF's demands for fiscal restraint, the consultancy's analysis showed..The new government will have to steer the processes of licensing new oil and gas projects, whereproduction, which began in 2010, flagged in the five years to 2024..Mahama plans to offer locals more ownership in future oil and mining projects if he wins..The cocoa sector also requires urgent attention..Output in the world's number two cocoa-producing country fell to a 20-year low last season, mired by low pay to farmers, plant diseases, heightened bean smuggling and illegal gold mining destroying plantations..The global cocoa market will be watching with interest whether a new president will implement an IMF policy suggestion for far-reaching reforms in the sector, and whethera new marketing modelthat replaced the over three-decade-old cocoa loan syndication will be continued."

2024-11-19,"Tittle:Competitors to challenge Elliott affiliate's bid for Citgo amid creditor unease
Article:.HOUSTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Companies seeking to claim proceeds from a court auction of shares in a parent of Venezuela-owned Citgo Petroleum are pressing a U.S. court to lift an exclusivity deal with an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management, which could pave the way for at least two new bids, sources close to the matter said..Theauctionof shares in the U.S. oil refiner's parent PDV Holding, aimed at paying 18 creditors up to $21.3 billion in awards against Venezuela, has become stalled..A conditional $7.3 billionbidin September by Elliott's wholly-owned Amber Energy for Venezuela's foreign crown jewel has been criticized by many of the creditors as inadequate and lawsuits by holders of Venezuelan bonds and notes are threatening to upend the seven-year-long court process..Judge Leonard Stark, who is overseeing the case in a federal court in Delaware, this month said he would soon set a path for the auction to move ahead, and set a Dec. 13 hearing to listen to arguments..Stark has been asked by creditors to reopen a data room to provide access to Citgo's financial documents to bidders, and terminate a period of exclusivity held by Amber Energy, according to court filings..At least two companies have told the court they could present new bids once restrictions are lifted..Canadian minerGold Reserve(GRZ.V), opens new tab, which submitted bids in the auction's first and second rounds, wants to revive a proposal that was set aside in August by a court officer managing the process. The officer had asked Gold Reserve to partner with U.S. oil refiner CVR Energy(CVI.N), opens new tab, which had separately bid, but gave Amber exclusive negotiating rights shortly after..Lawyers representing Venezuela also told the court they wanted to reserve the right to make a future bid to purchase the shares or to submit ""more effective and equitable""proposalsthan a sale..Amber did not reply to written questions. The company has told the court in recent weeks its bid would deliver the highest value for the shares, given the many challenges surrounding the process..Its $7.3 billion bid values Citgo at 5.9 times Citgo's last 12-month pre-tax earnings plus cash and debt, below the market's 6.9 times earnings average multiple for three big, publicly-traded rivals, according to financial firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt..""I can see why the creditors want a better number,"" said Tudor, Pickering refining analyst Matthew Blair..The auction is expected to be the culmination of a long-standing case first introduced by Canadian miner Crystallex in Delaware in 2017 that made Citgo's parent liable for Venezuela's debts. The judge wants to maximize sale proceeds to pay off as many creditors as possible..Stark first must decide on two proposals - one by a court officer appointed to oversee the auction and another by creditor ConocoPhillips(COP.N), opens new tab- that would both essentially block creditors from resorting to other courts in pursuit of the same assets. He is expected to rule on those motions in the coming weeks..If the proposals are rejected, Amber can walk away from the process, according to an agreement it reached with the court officer, Robert Pincus..Amber's original bid has not been accepted by the judge. In response to criticisms, Pincus last month presented a second bid by Amber modifying the structure of the payment waterfall, which would free about $5 billion for creditor payouts after the process is completed..Amber's bid was being treated as ""a stalking horse bid"" - one that generally sets a minimum price in bankruptcy auctions - a person close to the matter said, adding that the lack of details provided about the bid made it difficult to match..Another source said payout restrictions in Amber's bid would likely encourage other bids. Some companies say they can beat the Amber bid..""Assuming the data room is reopened immediately, there should be no impediment to finalizing the terms of a materially superior Gold Reserve bid,"" an attorney for the mining firm told the court in a filing in October..The company's prior bid was and remains ""demonstrably superior to the Elliott bid in every material category,"" its filing said..CVR is not expected to continue bidding, according to a person familiar with the matter. Neither Gold Reserve nor CVR Energy responded to requests for comment..Amber's bid includes set-asides and deductions that have been criticized by many of the 18 creditors seeking proceeds..""The Elliott bid is non-viable,"" said creditors Gold Reserve, Rusoro, Tidewater, Red Tree, Contrarian and Valores Mundiales in a joint argument..Some parties protested that the bid's structure would not guarantee payments to the highest-ranked creditors - Crystallex, Tidewater(TDW.N), opens new taband ConocoPhillips(COP.N), opens new tab..Companies further down the creditors' list ""would receive interests in a trust that may not pay them for years - if ever,"" said lower-ranked creditors Red Tree and Contrarian..Several questioned whether Amber's bid met conditions set by the court. If Amber's bid included a credit bid from the acquisition of claims by Koch Industries that are low in the ranking, it would require the payment in cash of all claims above it in the creditors' list..If creditors continue opposing bids, the court could be motivated to consider other alternatives, including a bankruptcy-like restructuring plan that would keep Citgo intact and provide a larger payout to creditors over time, analysts said."

""It needs to get cold for our business to really perform well in Q4,” Tractor Supply(TSCO.O), opens new tabCEO Hal Lawton said last month on a quarterly call..The company, which uses weather analytics, sells cold-weather products like heating pellets and outerwear..Weather analytics can help companies like Tractor Supply decide whether to discount winter items, said Planalytics CEO Fred Fox, whose clients include Dick's Sporting Goods(DKS.N), opens new taband Ross Stores(ROST.O), opens new tab..If November temperatures in the U.S. drop below 2023 levels - which forecasts suggest is likely - a discount now could mean a missed opportunity later, Fox said..As intuitive as that may seem to a retailer, they do not always get it right..In August, Lowe's(LOW.N), opens new tabChief Financial Officer Brandon Sink cited cold, wet weather in May as the reason forweaker salesin the prior quarter..But that description is inaccurate, said Bill Kirk, founder of Weather Trends, whose clients include Target(TGT.N), opens new tab, Gap(GAP.N), opens new tab, and Tractor Supply..May was indeed wet, Kirk's data shows, but not cold. It was the hottest May in six years for the U.S., he said, and third-hottest in four decades. ""Welcome to the world of retail excuses not based on facts,"" he said..Lowe's did not respond to a request for comment..About every three weeks in the U.S., a natural disaster causes $1 billion or more in damages, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, up from once every three months in the 1980s..Planalytics, which uses computer models to help retailers understand how weather affects sales, is on pace to provide clients with twice as many models in 2024 as it did last year, said Evan Gold, the company’s executive vice president of partnerships. Since 2019, that figure has shot up ninefold..Retailers typically see weather's impact in foot traffic and sales, said Stefan Bornemann, head of Meteonomiqs, whose clients include retailers using the e-commerce platform Shopify(SHOP.TO), opens new tab. ""The impact could get bigger, given more severe weather patterns,” he said..Kirk has analyzed how sales for a given product rise or fall with each degree of temperature change. Sales of horse blankets rise 7% per degree colder and Starbucks(SBUX.O), opens new tabcoffee sales climb 2%, he said..Starbucks did not reply to a request for comment..Some clients use Kirk's data for so-called dynamic pricing, the practice of adjusting prices to demand. If a sales season looks particularly weak, clients may implement small markdowns early, rather than be forced to impose larger ones later to clear excess inventory, Kirk said..The days of retailers using weather as an excuse for a poor earnings season should be over, he added..“Wall Street hates that excuse,” Kirk said. “What you’re saying to your investors is, ’We can’t control our business.’”"

Article:.LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Commodities reacted with trepidation to the election of Donald Trump to a second term as U.S. President, with most losing ground over fears the global economy will be hit by a new tariff war..The downbeat reaction was in stark contrast to U.S. equities, which surged torecord highsamid optimism that Trump's agenda of lower taxes will boost growth, at least in the United States..The contrasting response to Trump's victory over Democrat nominee and now outgoing U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris showed exactly why the likely impacts ofTrump's returnto the White House are hard to assess..Take crude oil for example..The world's most important commodity dipped when it became clear that Trump would prevail in Tuesday's vote, with global benchmark Brent futures dropping as much as 2.9% during Wednesday's trade, before ending the down 0.5% at $75.16 a barrel..In theory, Trump's energy policies should be somewhat bearish for global oil prices, as he is in favour of loosening regulation of the sector in the United Stares, and encouraging even higher output in the world's biggest crude producer..In practice, U.S. oil output may not move much higher, given it is already at record levels and companies will be wary about boosting production if they believe the impact will be to weaken prices further..Trump has also promised to bring peace to the Middle East, without specifying how this will be accomplished..But on the assumption he is able to convince Israel to end its conflict with Iran and the groups it supports, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, this would be bearish for oil prices as the geopolitical risk premium would dissipate..Trump's affinity for Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and another unspecified promise to end the Ukraine conflict, may also result in easing sanctions against Russia, which in turn may boost its exports of crude oil and other energy products such as liquefied natural gas and coal..On the other hand, Trump has made it clear he aims to go hard against Iran, and may try to tighten sanctions against Tehran, which in turn may make it slightly harder for Iran to sell its crude..Trump's plan to impose tariffs of 10%-20% on all U.S. imports, and up to 60% from those from China, is also likely to hurt crude prices, given it would likely curtail global trade, leading to slower economic growth and the risk of higher inflation and interest rates..Overall, the main risks for crude appear to be to the downside, complicating the task for OPEC and its allies in the wider OPEC+ group to set a production policy that tries to keep prices high enough, without the group having to give up too much market share..LNG is another commodity that in theory may face a more bearish outlook under Trump, given his support for expanding U.S. production and the construction of new export plants..But again, much will depend on Trump's trade policy..If comprehensive tariffs are placed on all imports into the United States, it's likely that countries will respond with tit-for-tat tariffs on their imports of U.S. goods..This means that U.S. LNG, and indeed crude oil and coal, may cost more than alternatives, meaning that U.S. producers may have to discount prices to remain competitive, or hope that tariffs aren't placed on their products..The prospects for industrial metals appear bleaker than for energy commodities, especially since they are more exposed to China, the world's biggest buyer of copper and iron ore..London copper contracts slumped 4.1% on Wednesday, ending at $9,343 a metric ton, the weakest close in nearly two months..Singapore iron ore futures fared somewhat better, but still ended down 1.2% at $104.16 a ton, while zinc contracts in London dropped 4.2% to $2,973 a ton..Iron ore is the key raw material used to make steel, while zinc is mainly used to galvanise steel..Both are heavily exposed to China, and therefore face the prospect of lower demand if exports from the world's second-biggest economy are hit by Trump's planned tariffs, and the likely accompanying slowdown and re-ordering of global trade..Another commodity that is likely to play a wait and watch game is gold, with the spot price dropping 3.1% on Wednesday to end at $2,659.24 an ounce..The decline was largely because of a surging U.S. dollar, but gold also faces contradictory pressures from a Trump presidency..Higher bond yields and interest rates, caused by Trump's likely inflationary tariffs and tax cuts, will cut the appeal of gold..But the precious metal may also benefit from the possible volatility of a Trump presidency, which may heighten geopolitical risk and encourage investors to diversify assets..Overall, Trump's second term comes with more downside risks for commodities, but much will depend on how much of his economic and political agenda he is able to implement, and how quickly it is done..The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

Article:.TUNIS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Tunisia's central bank will no longer have the exclusive power to adjust interest rates or foreign exchange policy, and must only take such action in consultation with the government, but it will be allowed to finance the treasury, a bill proposed by lawmakers showed on Friday..The step is the latest move that will completely undermine the central bank's independence after continuous criticism by President Kais Saied, who has said that the bank should not be a state within a state..The potential major change in the central bank law comes as public finances face a severe crisis. The country has been unable to secure Western funding since Saied seized nearly all power in 2021, ruling by decree, in a move the opposition has called a coup..Twenty-seven lawmakers warned that Tunisia would inevitably go bankrupt if the bank law was not changed..They said that the current law, adopted in 2016, which does not allow the central bank to make loans to the public treasury or direct bond purchases, has led to huge losses for the state estimated at $36.6 billion..The bill also proposes that the bank will not be allowed to sign agreements with foreign oversight authorities without the president’s approval..Saied rejected last year the independence of the central bank, saying it should lend directly to the state treasury to avoid costly loans through banks..In January, the government asked the central bank to provide $2.25 billion of direct funding to the treasury to fill a budget deficit..Former central bank governor Marouan Abassi has warned that buying treasury bonds had risks, including upward pressure on inflation, and a drop in the value of Tunisia's currency..Earlier this year, Saied replaced Abassi with Zouhair Nouri..Since 2016, the central bank has had absolute power to control monetary policy, reserves and gold..But the proposed bill showed that the central bank could adjust interest rates, operations related to gold and exchange in consultation with the government..Under the bill, the central bank will be allowed to buy government bonds from banks and lend directly the treasury up to 3% of GDP with maturities exceeding five years..Financial sources told Reuters that the move will likely pave the way for a new government request for the central bank to provide up to $2.6 billion in direct facilities and loans to the treasury."

Harris led Trump by a marginal 46% to 43% in aReuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, a tighter race than the same poll showed a couple weeks earlier..Given Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden in 2020, investors expect any close outcome might also be contested this year. The balance of power in Congress is also at stake, with a number of potentially close contests that could ratchet up uncertainty..""This is going to be a very close election. It just stands to reason that the likelihood of some type of dispute occurring is higher than it is on average,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. He expects stocks to sell off if the result is in doubt for more than a few days..""Markets do not like uncertainty, and they certainly would not like the fact that we don't know who the president of the United States is a day or two after the election,” Todd said..For now, political uncertainty appears to be doing little to dampen enthusiasm for stocks, as strong U.S. economic growth has helped theS&P 500 power to fresh highs.

""That to me is a real risk ... a litigated outcome, where the stock market probably sells off."".Recent precedents for challenged elections are few..Markets were largely unperturbed by Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

PDV Holding's only asset is Citgo's 807,000-barrel-per-day refining network and linked facilities..If the Delaware court handling the auction cannot block the rival claims, the Elliott affiliate's offer can be withdrawn in days, throwing the auction into chaos..Holders led by Gramercy Distressed Opportunity Fund want to have the Delaware court prioritize their payments, which would cut the potential proceeds from the share auction available to other creditors, leaving a large number of them empty-handed..Creditors including oil giant ConocoPhillips(COP.N), opens new tab, Gold Reserve(GRZ.V), opens new taband miner Crystallex, which brought the original case that found Citgo's parent liable for Venezuela's debts, have opposed allowing thebondholders to jump the line..If the Gramercy claims are not barred, they could dash the court's carefully constructed 'first come, first serve' priority order that begins with Crystallex, Tidewater(TDW.N), opens new tab, ConocoPhillips, O-I Glass(OI.N), opens new taband Huntington Ingalls(HII.N), opens new tab..Citgo, Venezuela's crown jewel of foreign assets, has been valued up to $13 billion as part of the auction while claims against those shares total $21.3 billion. Venezuela's external debt, which remains largely unpaid, is about $150 billion..Robert Pincus, the court officer managing the auction, hasrequestedthe judge block creditors already participating in the sale process from resorting to other courts..Judge Leonard Stark is expected to make a decision soon, which could be challenged, further delaying the sale or forcing the court officer to start negotiations with another bidder, or ultimately scrap the auction..Another group of creditors, the holders of bonds collateralized with Citgo equity, also could be prioritized. They have not won their court cases about the bonds' validity, but Stark this year approved a motion to include payment provisions as part of bids, which granted them a place in the deliberations..Pincusfailed to reacha payment agreement with these holders as part of the bid negotiation on the deadline set by the court. Because of the many obstacles in the middle, Elliott affiliate's offer has not been confirmed by the judge and the process' deadlines will not be enforced until a new schedule is approved, Stark said last month..Several creditors have told the judge they could follow Gramercy's strategy and file parallel lawsuits if Stark does not block the holders from resorting to other courts..Siemens Energy this month filed asimilar lawsuitin a Texas court seeking to recoup about $200 million from a promissory note unpaid by Citgo's ultimate parent, state company PDVSA..Creditors that do not hold Venezuelan bonds or notes and lawyers representing Venezuela havecriticizedthe negotiation between Pincus and Amber Energy, arguing it lacks transparency and the bid's amount is too low to even cover the first claims in line..They will be granted time to file objections to the offer and to the process once a new calendar is approved, likely postponing the case's final hearing to early 2025, the judge said."

Article:.WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in August as exports increased to a record high, suggesting trade could have little or no impact on economic growth in the third quarter..The smaller-than-expected trade gap reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday added to data on thelabor marketandconsumerspending in suggesting that the economy remained on solid footing last quarter..The economy's strength likely has no impact on expectations that the Federal Reserve willcut interest rates againnext month. It, however, reinforced views that the U.S. central bank did not need to pursue another half-percentage point rate reduction. Economists at Goldman Sachs maintained their forecast for gross domestic product to rise at a 3.2% annualized rate in the July-September quarter after the trade data..""This report says that net trade supports GDP growth in August,"" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. ""Putting together July and August figures suggests that net trade is flat so far in third quarter, making no significant addition or subtraction to GDP growth so far.""
The trade gap contracted 10.8% to $70.4 billion, the smallest in five months, from a revised $78.9 billion in July, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said..Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit would narrow to $70.6 billion from the previously reported $78.8 billion in July..Exports increased 2.0% to a record $271.8 billion. Goods exports surged 2.5% to $179.4 billion, the highest level since September 2022. They were boosted by a $1.7 billion rise in capital goods to a record high, mostly reflecting telecommunications equipment, civilian aircraft, computer accessories as well as other industrial machinery..But exports of semiconductors fell..Consumer goods exports increased $1.0 billion, lifted by pharmaceutical preparations. Exports of industrial supplies and materials increased as a $1.1 billion drop in crude oil was more than offset by a $1.5 billion rise in nonmonetary gold..Automotive vehicles, parts and engines increased, driven by passenger car exports. Non-petroleum exports were the highest on record, as were those of other goods..Exports of services increased $0.9 billion to an all-time high of $92.3 billion amid rises in travel as well as government goods and services. But exports of transport services fell..Imports decreased 0.9% to $342.2 billion. Goods imports dropped 1.4% to $274.3 billion, pulled down by a $3.9 billion decline in industrial supplies and materials as well as a $1.2 billion decrease in nonmonetary gold..Crude oil imports fell $1.0 billion. That reflected lower prices as well as quantities. Imported crude oil prices averaged $74.28 per barrel in August compared with $75.96 in July..Motor vehicles, parts and engines imports decreased $1.3 billion, weighed down by passenger cars. But imports of other goods were the highest since December 2021. Goods imports had surged in the prior months, likely as businesses rushed to bring in shipments in anticipation of higher tariffs as well asa strike by dockworkerslast week, which lasted only three days..Stocks on Wall Streettraded higher.The dollar slippedagainst a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose..With domestic demand still strong despite 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the Fed in 2022 and 2023, the decline in goods imports is likely to be temporary. The central bank launched its policy easing cycle last month, cutting its benchmark overnight interest rate by 50 basis points to the 4.75%-to-5.00% range, its first rate reduction since 2020..""The resolution of the dockworkers strike earlier this month ensures supply chain disruptions would be minimal and removes a key risk to trade outlook,"" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""Depleted inventories and resilient consumer demand indicate the drop in imports is unlikely to be sustained."".Imports of services increased $0.7 billion to an all-time high of $67.9 billion amid gains in travel and charges for the use of intellectual property. But imports of transport services declined..When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit declined 8.9% to $88.6 billion. The average of the so-called real goods trade deficit for July and August roughly equals the average for the second quarter. Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product for two straight quarters. The economy grew at a 3.0% pace in the April-June quarter..The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China narrowed $2.6 billion to $24.7 billion, with exports rising and imports decreasing. The goods trade gap with Canada also contracted, but widened with Mexico..Economists perceived the rise in exports as unsustainable..""The risks to global demand are tilted to the downside, as China's economy has yet to meaningfully stabilize and growth across the eurozone is showing some signs of fragility,"" said Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo. ""On the flip side, domestic demand is poised to remain firm amid solid personal income growth and a strong dollar. Taken together, we look for trade to be a modest drag on real GDP growth throughout 2025."""
2024-10-08,"Tittle:Exclusive: Mali says Barrick Gold owes $500 million in taxes, fines - sources
Article:.Oct 8 (Reuters) - Mali's military government is seeking at least 300 billion CFA ($512 million) in outstanding taxes and dividends from Barrick Gold, three sources said, a move that is part of a push by the country to collect more revenue from mining companies..Authorities in Mali last monthbriefly detained four Malian staffworking for Barrick, the world's second-largest gold miner, and the Canadian company said on Sept. 30 it hadagreed with the governmentto solve existing claims and disputes..The demands on Barrick follow anaudit of mining contractslast year and a subsequentpush by Mali to renegotiate existing agreementswith mining firms, including Bing2GOLD, Resolute Mining and Allied Gold, to channel a greater share of revenues into state coffers through a new mining code..Under the new code - which comes as governments across Africa seek more revenues from their mines producing gold and the critical minerals needed for global energy transition - Malian state and private interests in projects could rise to 35% from 20% now. The law also seeks to slash tax breaks and increase the number of Malians in management roles..Three sources with direct knowledge of the talks between the government and mining companies said Barrick, which runs the Loulo-Gounkoto mines in western Mali with an 80% stake, had been presented a bill for at least 300 billion CFA..One of the sources, a consultant working with mining companies in Mali, said the bill was mainly for retroactive tax adjustments and unpaid dividends..Another source, who works with mining companies and the Malian government, confirmed the figure, saying the bill would cover taxes owed from 2020, 2021 and 2022..A third source, a senior official with another mining company in the country, said Mali believes Barrick owes as much as 500 billion CFA and the claim is also linked to the non-repatriation of funds..All the sources spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the issue in Mali..Asked to comment, a spokesperson for Barrick said: ""We are still in the process of negotiation and will let you know once the agreement is settled""..In Barrick's 2023 annual report, the firm said it received tax collection notices at the end of November 2023 for around $417 million relating to VAT credit balances that had offset taxes and royalties but were subsequently disallowed by Malian authorities..Barrick said the tax bills were ""without merit"" but that it had paid $17 million as part of a six month stay on enforcement on them..It was not immediately clear why the amount provided by the sources was some $100 million higher than the figure provided by Barrick. One of the sources said the amount Mali says Barrick owes has increased as authorities deepened investigations..A fourth source, also a senior official with another mining company, said they had heard Barrick was preparing to make a $300-$350 million payment to the government. The source did not have further details. Barrick declined to comment..Malian government officials did not respond to requests for comment. In August 2023, the mining ministry said the audit had revealedthe government was missing 300 billion to 600 billion CFA francsin revenues that it intended to recover from companies..Mali is not alone in seeking a bigger share of revenues from the race for Africa's minerals. In neighbouring Burkina Faso, the junta-led government said this monthit planned to strip some foreign firms of permits. Niger's military governmenthas also revoked permits..Sources close to the talks in Mali said the junta is using a mixture of coercion, including arrests of local staff, and the potential threat of mining licences being revoked, as they squeeze the mainly Western firms for more cash..Mali's government declined to comment. President Assimi Goita said last year investors had the choice of accepting Mali's new mining rules or leaving the country..On Sept. 21, Alousseni Sanou, Mali's minister for mining and economy, said B2GOLD, Allied Gold and Robex had signed new contracts that will bring in an additional 245 billion CFA a year for the state..Ever since Mali called on Russia for military support in its fight against Islamist militants, there has been intense speculation that any permits stripped off existing operators might be handed to Russian firms. So far, this has not happened..""The purchase of Barrick assets in Mali is not on the table,"" one source familiar with the issue told Reuters..($1 = 586.0000 CFA francs)"

Rally looks to fizzle out today given the NDRC disappointment, but fundamental valuations for Chinese assets remain attractive. Look to see if further measures will be announced later."".""The FX impact from the NDRC press conference disappointment was largely muted, as the CNH and CNY trading was relatively stable amid the stock market frenzy..""However, the risks to CNH are skewed to the downside due to cooling China market optimism and the recent USD rally. We noted that the PBoC's massive easing and the positive signals from the Politburo meeting have tempered bearish China growth expectations, outweighing the negative impact from the US-China interest rate spread widening after the PBoC's rate cut..""An underwhelming stimulus package could swiftly dampen bullish sentiment, giving way to the PBoC's rate cut materialising to weigh on the RMB exchange rate."".""I believe there was significant pent-up demand for Chinese stocks, as evidenced by citizens lining up to open new accounts. However, while these market movements can be exciting, they are often not sustainable. The CSI 300 has surged approximately 38% over the past six days. Typically, returns on Chinese markets average around 10%, so we've exceeded that by nearly four times..""The returns between Hong Kong and Chinese stocks remain largely parallel, although Hong Kong is underperforming today. This underperformance may be due to some investors reallocating their funds from Hong Kong to Chinese markets, where government stimulus is more direct. The Chinese government has a strong capacity to mobilize resources, and if executed correctly, this could lead to Chinese markets outperforming those of other countries."".""Markets were hoping to obtain some guidance on the size of fiscal stimulus at this presser – but with MoF not in attendance, it was unlikely this information was going to be provided. Recall market estimates on stimulus ranged between CNY 2 trillion – 10 trillion. A number closer to 10 was needed to sustain the risk rally..""NDRC Chairman recapped key announcements and pledges with no new information – disappointing the markets..""What's next? No major press briefing lined up so far. Thus, it is likely we see markets consolidating and digesting what has already been announced, which arguably is meaningful, but not quite enough to satiate lofty expectations."".""We're seeing a shakeout at the highs of a very strong rally. But when we reach the point of a rally where my neck hurts by looking at it, you could argue a pullback is overdue..""Either way, it seems some are booking profits after exceptional gains over gold week, and this could deter others from simply stepping in to support the market immediately. And that paves the way for some chop around the top, if not a deeper pullback for China's markets."".""I think there's a lot of expectations for some further meat on the bones of the physical stimulus that's been talked about a bit recently... talk about consumption vouchers, perhaps more infrastructure spending investment."".""The strong showing today is not a big surprise as the Chinese bourses are probably playing catch-up after both the Hang Seng Tech Index in Hong Kong and the Golden Dragon Index in the U.S. surged by over 10% in the first week of October when Chinese markets were closed for the Golden Week holidays..""There are no clear signs that the Chinese economy is on the mend yet, so this rally is largely sentiment-driven and sparked by Beijing's stimulus blitz in late September..""Ultimately for the rally to be sustainable, we need to see more fiscal policy and more measures to support the economy and the property market. A great deal of hope has been built into the strong rally in recent weeks and we now need to see additional government policy action to support the uptrend."".""I think the movement today basically explains that in the Chinese onshore market, it's just rising to a level that investors are comfortable with..""Because no one is really certain about what is going on in the stimulus... there could be a bit of uncertainties about whether it is above or below market expectations."".""Mainland China stocks are largely playing catch-up, after being out for the Golden Week holiday over the past week. Optimism around recent stimulus efforts remains at play."".""So far, the NDRC press conference appears to run short on details with regards to stimulus measures. Hopes were raised but the delivery was disappointing. Post-opening rally in Chinese equities has fizzled out and the lack of follow-through is a setback to sentiments."""

Article:.PRESTEA-HUNI VALLEY, Ghana, Oct 7 (Reuters) - At an unlicensed gold mine in Ghana, men in t-shirts, shorts and rubber boots wade through pools of muddy water laced with mercury, pull out rocks with bare hands and operate a rickety sluice as they search for the precious ore..The ramshackle mine is part of a booming business that is generating livelihoods and informal revenue streams for Ghana's economy, even as itharms miners' health, pollutes waterways, destroys forests andcocoa farms, and fuels crime..""It's risky but I just want to survive,"" said one of the men at the wildcat site visited by Reuters in the Prestea-Huni Valley district in western Ghana..The 24-year-old accounting student, who asked not to be named because he was involved in illegal activities, said he had been skipping classes to prospect for gold because he needed the money, having lost his father as a teenager..There was no professional protective equipment at the mine. Men wore flimsy plastic shopping bags on their heads. One had swimming goggles and another a rice bag covering his torso..The unlicensed gold mining industry, known in Ghana as ""galamsey"", has grown at a breakneck pace this year as global gold prices have risen by almost 30%, enticing new entrants..Small-scale mines produced 1.2 million ounces of gold in the first seven months of this year, more than in the whole of 2023, according to data from Ghana's mining sector regulator..About 40% of Ghana's total gold output comes from small mines, as opposed to concessions operated by multi-national firms. Some 70-80% of the small mines are unlicensed..Martin Ayisi, head of Ghana's Minerals Commission, the mining industry regulator, said most galamsey gold was smuggled out of the country and was therefore not contributing to national gold export revenues..For Ayisi, the rise in gold prices is good for Ghana, helping it recover from a severe economic crisis in 2022 that required a $3-billion IMF bailout..""We should be able to get a lot of money and probably exit the IMF programme earlier,"" he said, forecasting national gold export revenues would more than double to $10 billion this year..But industry experts say the lines between legal mining and galamsey are blurred, and gold from informal mines represents a larger proportion of revenues than the authorities acknowledge..The dangers of galamsey, however, are not in dispute..Dozens of miners have been killed in collapsing pits in recent years, according to news reports and human rights groups, while hospitals and health centres report high numbers of early deaths from pulmonary diseases of miners and residents of towns and villages near mines..These are caused by inhaling dust that contains heavy metals such as lead, as well as poisonous fumes from the mercury and nitric acid the miners use to leach gold out of sediment..The chemicals are then dumped on the ground or in rivers.

Gamal Nasser seized control of the Suez Canal for Egypt, prompting a response by Britain and France, and at almost the same time, Soviet tanks went rolling into Budapest to quell Hungary’s brief experiment with some kind of revived democracy. But for now, people may be selling but they’re not panicking. The Dow is down only a half a percentage point at this stage, and we’re down less than 2% on the Nasdaq. But we are seeing a flight to quality, like utilities and healthcare and consumer staples, all of which are either higher or down less than the market. Gold and silver – classic stores of value in times of crisis – are also moving higher. But we’re not seeing tremendous changes higher or lower. I think people are adjusting their positions, out of a sense that they need to be prepared for whatever happens next.”.“The fact that the US is already commenting on an imminent retaliatory attack by Iran suggests, if it happens, it will be more in line with the well telegraphed and calibrated attack in April 2024, rather than the start of something more devastating or inflammatory.”.“But the market, which in the example of oil is not pricing in much disruption from a region-wide conflict, is highly sensitive to any scenario worse than this.”.GILES COGHLAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GCFX, BILSTON, ENGLAND.""It's a classic risk-off move on the headlines that Iran intends to carry out a ballistic missile attack against Israel imminently."".""That's why we're seeing equity markets sell off and we're seeing strength coming to the yen and the Swiss franc and the dollar."".""However, it's unlikely to last because when they've (Iran) attacked in the past, it quickly fizzled out."".“Oil prices are higher today; gold prices are higher. Those are the kind of reactions you’d expect to see in response to headlines about tensions in the Middle East. But the fact that the stock market is down also has something to do with the fact that it’s trading at a richly-valued multiple. That makes it hard to absorb a sudden news shock like this; events become more meaningful when the market is richly valued. Plus, we’re heading into a jobs report on Friday. People are worried overall about a spike in volatility.”.ALLAN SMALL, SENIOR INVESTMENT ADVISOR, ALLAN SMALL FINANCIAL GROUP WITH IA PRIVATE WEALTH, TORONTO.""Markets had gotten used to a lot of geopolitics as Israel continued its fight inGazaand with Hamas; it seemed like that wasn't affecting markets much. It seemed like a lot of the fighting had been done already and that was winding down and then here we are - a new spark comes up. The market will sell off on that headline, whether or not it rebounds today or tomorrow depends on whether the headline coming out now is valid or not..""If the war escalates, that of course is not good for markets but would be good for the price of oil, gold and those stocks though most of the other stocks would probably sell off like we're seeing today."".""I think the initial market reaction to the news has been pretty much exactly as one would have expected, with a knee-jerk risk-off vibe sweeping across the board, as the dollar vaulted to day-highs, along with gold and long-end Treasuries, while stocks and higher beta G10s slumped."".""The key question now is the degree to which these initial moves are consolidated, or pare back, which hinges almost entirely on whether an Iranian attack is indeed forthcoming. Markets, hence, are likely to display an incredibly high sensitivity to incoming geopolitical news flow in the coming hours. Though, if recent reports are to be believed and the aforementioned attack is similar in scale to that delivered in April, this could be greeted with a sigh of relief, and not be interpreted as a significant sign of escalation beyond what has already been seen."".""The situation in the Middle East continues to evolve rapidly. With Iran and Lebanon being drawn into the Middle East conflict more directly, reactions today are playing out in higher crude and gold prices. While rising geopolitical tensions create elevated market uncertainty and anxiety over the near term, investors will likely measure the longer-term impact of growing Middle East conflict through potential impacts on oil supply."".""It's obviously risk-off. People will buy up Treasuries, sell stocks, buy oil - all the normal things you would think of in this situation."".""This highlights the circumstance of this market in the fact that there are a myriad of risks out there, whether that's slowing employment in the U.S., the geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East. And the market seems very mispriced for any flare-up of any of those risks... It's vulnerable to shocks like this."".LOU BASENESE, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, MDB CAPITAL, NEW YORK:.""The markets are acting predictably. In the lead-up to and outbreak of war or geopolitical crises, major indexes sell off reflexively, dropping an average of 5% to 7%. The selling pressure typically lasts for about two weeks. Within another two weeks, though, they typically recover. So trading around the fear or outbreak is a risky proposition at best..""That said, the nature of each conflict can have more lasting impacts on individual sectors or areas of the market, like oil and defense stocks. In this case, we'd be hard pressed to find anyone that disagrees that an Iranian attack would be a major escalation and indication of a protracted conflict, which should keep driving both oil and defense stocks higher."""

Article:.SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Mining investment conferences have a great track record of pointing to the next growth area for commodities, as they bring together early stage investors and junior miners seeking to get projects off the ground..A decade ago lithium was the popular metal, five years ago it was the turn of gold and more recently copper has been the flavour of the month at these events across Asia..But at the 121 Mining and Energy Investment conference this week in Singapore there was no clear choice, and no real consensus on where the best opportunities lie..If there was a broad theme, it was that the energy transition is real and happening, even if it will take place at varying speeds and in different forms across Asia, the world's most populous region and the engine room of global economic growth..But how best to leverage the energy transition into profitable investments is turning into a vexing challenge for both those with cash to splash and those seeking to develop projects aimed at accelerating the change to cleaner fuels and power systems..One of the surprising metals on the radar screen at the conference was lithium. It went out of favour in recent years after a surge in investment took the market into surplus, resulting in a collapse of prices, which have dropped some 88% since reaching a record high in December 2022..The thinking is that while the lithium market is currently oversupplied, and this may persist into 2025, there is a wave of new demand coming..Much of the bearishness surrounding lithium has been about the slower-than-expected uptake of electric vehicles in the developed world..But while sales may have been disappointing, lithium demand is set for strong increases in the next few years as electric heavy vehicles enter service, and as battery storage to firm renewables such as wind and solar become more widespread..It's this demand for lithium that will end up trumping any weakness in EV car sales, and it's set to accelerate strongly by 2030, which is coincidently around the time a mining company may be able to bring on new production assuming they started development soon..Another out of favour commodity is coal, but there was interest expressed in metallurgical, or coking coal, the higher quality fuel used mainly to make steel..In effect this is an India play, with the expectation that as it continues its massive infrastructure build out, the South Asian nation will also produce more steel, and thus need to import coking coal given the lack of domestic resources..While coal is the bogeyman of climate change, the view among some investors is that given the energy transition relies heavily on steel, coking coal can be acceptable given its role in producing steel..Steel can be de-carbonised by upgrading iron ore using green hydrogen and then using electric arc furnaces, but the view is that this will take several decades to reach the scale needed, and in the meantime the coal-intensive, traditional basic oxygen furnace method will dominate in India, as it does in China..Another part of the commodity complex attracting investor interest is the midstream sector, where raw materials are processed into intermediate goods..The desire of Western countries to diversify away from China's dominance of metal processing is unlocking opportunities, such as the capital available from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act..The trick is navigating the bureaucratic processes behind the various global legislations, and even if the money can be accessed, it still may not be enough to overcome China's economies of scale and first mover advantages..For example, setting up a lithium processing plant in Australia, the world's biggest producer of the battery metal, is likely to come in at up to eight times the capital and operating cost of a similar operation in China..Accessing capital remains an ongoing struggle, with both investors and miners saying the pools of available capital are shrinking, especially if Chinese money is deemed politically unacceptable..This means that smaller projects are increasingly turning to intermediaries to obtain funding, such as global trading houses such as Glencore and Trafigura..Banks will lend to these well-established companies, and they in turn will lend to smaller-scale projects..But the problem with this process is that it increases the cost of capital and slows down the pace at which new projects can be brought on line..The bottom line is that the energy transition is viewed as offering huge opportunities to miners, traders and investors, but it remains plagued by uncertainty over which technologies will emerge as the leaders, and also the lack of coordinated government policies such as incentives and carbon taxes..The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."

The index reversed a 1.6% loss to end the day up 1.1%..Nvidia jumped after CEO Jensen Huang flagged strong demand for the company's chips, boosting its market value by more than $200 billion and accounting for 44% of the S&P 500's surge that day, data from Nomura showed..Nvidia's rally ""got the whole market moving,"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group..The S&P 500 has struggled to make headway this year on Nvidia's down days, eking out gains only 13% of the time when the chipmaker's shares have closed weaker, a Reuters analysis showed..This year, the index has failed to rise more than 1% on any day when Nvidia's shares ended lower. In 2020, there were 13 such instances..For many investors, the recent movesrevived worriesover a small cohort of stocks dictating the market's direction..Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia have a combined weighting of nearly 20% in the S&P 500, though shares of the first two have gained far less this year than Nvidia's..While recent strength in non-tech sectors has stirred hopes of a broadening rally, a sustained sell-off in any of the tech megacaps could still badly hurt broader markets, analysts said..""If Nvidia is weak because demand for their product goes down then that's going to tank the whole market,"" said Susquehanna's Murphy..Traders are keeping a close eye on Nvidia's options, which have played a major role in boosting recent moves..Nvidia recently accounted for about 22% of the overall volume of individual stock options traded daily, up from around 5% at the start of the year, making it the most actively traded stock in the options market on most days, Trade Alert data showed..Nvidia's gains are amplified when traders rush into upside call options.

The EU's ETS represented 87% of the global total - 770 billion euros..The decision will not impact the precious metals market as Credit Agricole CIB's business - mainly trading derivatives related to the precious metals for clients - is small compared to the industry's giants..The bank, the sources said, has been gradually decreasing its presence there since taking a hit when the pandemic dislocated the gold market four years ago..Flight restrictions and precious metal refinery closures in early 2020 created worries that traders would not be able to move gold to the United States in time to deliver against futures contracts..As a result, gold and silver prices in London and New York diverged sharply, leading to high demand for exchange of futures for physical (EFPs), which allow traders to swap gold or silver futures positions to and from physical metal, and extreme volatility in EFP premiums..Many banks were able to weather the storm as they did not cut positions, opting to wait for the price gap to normalise..Credit Agricole chose to close its positions and realise the loss, two of the sources said, without disclosing the size of the position or loss..The bank's precious metals business, according to one of the sources, was making several tens of millions of dollars a year before 2020. For comparison, global gold trading volumes wereestimated by the World Gold Councilat $241 billion a day in August..""They did try to re-grow the business two years ago but never really got going unfortunately,"" said another of the sources.

Article:.SURUCUCU, Brazil, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Brazil has almost squashed theillegal gold rushthat led thousands of wildcat miners into the Yanomami reservation in the Amazon rainforest and caused a humanitarian crisis of disease and malnutrition, the man in charge of operations said..The Yanomami, South America's largest Indigenous group living in isolation, have returned to a normal way of life, cultivating crops and hunting game, Nilton Tubino told Reuters in an interview on Friday..Tubino runs the government office set up by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to coordinate action by police and military forces, environmental agents and health workers on the reservation the size of Portugal in the remote Amazon, where 27,000 Yanomami live..""We are seeing many of them bathing in the rivers and out hunting again, and clearings being planted for food,"" he said..In hundreds of operations since March, army and navy troops, backed up by environmental and Indigenous protection agencies, have destroyed mining camps and gold prospects..They have dynamited 42 clandestine airstrips used by the miners in the rainforest, set fire to 18 aircraft, seized 92,000 liters of diesel, sunk 45 dredging barges, destroyed 700 pumps, and dismantled 90 Starlink dishes that allowed the miners to warn each other about enforcement teams, Tubino said. A radar has been set up in the reservation to monitor clandestine planes..Tubino said deaths from malaria brought by the miners were down, and malnutrition had been controlled with government food parcels. The government has reopened medical outposts and is planning to build a hospital in Surucucu, a remote village near the border with Venezuela..A Reuters photographer in Surucucu earlier this month saw evidence of illegal miners inside the reservation still, but with the situation improved from last year..Junior Hekurari, head of the Yanomami health council Condisi, said the government had evicted the miners and overcome the health crisis, but that the mining had affected their ability to obtain food, with river waters polluted by mercury..""The waters are poisoned and there are no fish,"" he said. ""Our people believe the earth has been contaminated and that is why the crops are not growing."".Shortly after taking office, Lula launched a massive enforcement operation in February 2023 to evict some 25,000 gold miners from the Yanomami territory. With backing from the armed forces, the government action succeeded in expelling 80% of the miners..But once the military withdrew, miners started to return, joining others who had hidden in the forest..Tubino said the number of miners remaining is unknown, but this year's operations had significantly reduced their presence and eliminated more than half the gold prospecting areas..Work is still needed to shut down the supply line that keeps the miners in business, from fuel and food to the buying of their gold nuggets, Tubino added."

""This initiative came really out of the blue."".Another company source said: ""It's like shooting yourself in the foot."".Cutting exports of uranium, nickel and titanium - which Putin mentioned explicitly - would cut the foreign currency earnings of Russia's biggest firms including state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec, state nuclear monopoly Rosatom and Nornickel, the world's top producer of refined nickel..Together, they employ about a million people, and their revenues have already been affected by Western sanctions..Nornickel's(GMKN.MM), opens new tabfirst-half profit fell by 22% as it tries to pivot its exports to Asia.

He noted that Russia has 22% of the world's natural gas reserves, 23% of gold reserves, and 55% of global diamond reserves..Uranium may be the one commodity where restrictions could genuinely hurt the West..Russia accounted for 27% of the enriched uranium supplied to U.S. commercial nuclear reactors last year. While the U.S. has in theory banned imports of the fuel from Russia, it also provided for waivers through 2027 as it expands its own enrichment facilities..Yet Europe has largely weaned itself off the Russian gas it used to depend on.
