         "what gives? \"delegates historically trend overly bullish,\" notes nicky shiels, precious metals strategist at swiss refining and finance group mks pamp (and moderator of day 1's excellent pgm session), in her round-up of last week's lbma conference. \"[so] the mildly bullish forecast from delegates is indicative of a lack of conviction\" in the face of higher-for-longer interest rates, even \"while physical [consumer] regions and central banks continue to be super supportive.\" contrarian klaxon? reviewing the history of lbma conference forecasts, maybe the past 12 months' gains in gold just weren't big enough. because, if you map prior conference predictions against what just happened to prices... ...rather than trying to see if those forecasts hold any predictive value... ...then the chart makes much more sense. especially if you allow for the fact that, for many lbma conference attendees, the price they charge – whether for coins, small bars or jewelry – comes a little or more above spot prices anyway. gold quality at root, the lbma exists to set and maintain the good delivery standards for the fineness, shape and size of bullion bars acceptable to the london market, heart of precious metals trading and storage worldwide. that way, lbma members – and their customers – trade only the very best metal, good every time it's delivered and without needing an assayer to check and re-check quality each time the gold is moved from one specialist vault to another.",

         "gold at lbma 2023: high, quality, liquid article:taking stock in barcelona. lots of gold bar and coin stock...! another autumn, another lbma conference for the precious metals industry, writes adrian ash at bullionvault. more attendees than ever joined the london bullion market association's latest shindig, held last week in barcelona, spain. but while everyone got busy meeting with partners, suppliers, buyers, competitors and friends, they got much less news than we've grown accustomed to. no market-changing rules (responsible sourcing for refiners, lbma 2011 in montreal) or shock exits (mitsui, vienna 2015) or sudden buyers (reserve bank of india, edinburgh 2009) or existential crises (banking's nsfr regulations, singapore 2016). instead, this year's event offered a moment to take stock. and as the excellent session on 'consumer demand in a time of high prices' showed – as well as the cheerful \"tumbleweed\" comments from many attendees over drinks – there's a lot of stock to take for gold bar-and-coin retailers right now. if there was a scoop (heavens knows we tried to find you one, beyond the whispers and mutterings about central-bank demand in 2023 beating even last year's post-war record gold reserves demand) it came on day 2, in the final formal session of the lbma 2023 conference in barcelona.",

         "gold was trading nearly $375 lower than that only this time last year. but even with gold prices now trading at their highest ever for the lbma's october conference (even in dollar terms) it doesn't mark the highest-ever such forecast. for that, see montreal 2011 predicting $2019 off $1800, or lockdown's 2020 conference online predicting $2177 off $1900 at the time of asking. moreover, last week's forecast predicted only a 4% rise from where gold was trading as the conference began. and that broke the mold if not the cupola... ...because while lbma delegates peering at their crystal balls tend to forecast a bullish move after seeing one over the prior 12 months... ...the conference's 4% twelve-month outlook contrasts with the last 12 months' 15% gain in gold prices. that was the 5th biggest bullish move from october-to-october of the last 15 lbma conferences. yet in percentage terms, lbma conference attendees just gave their least bullish prediction since the depths of gold's post-financial crisis bear market in 2015. and that was the only time since the early 2000s that delegates – on average – said prices would drop.",
