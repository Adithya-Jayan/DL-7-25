2025-06-20,"Copper smelters are facing both market and pricing crises:.LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - Copper smelters are now so desperate to find raw material they are paying miners for converting their concentrates into refined metal..So-called treatment and refining charges (TCRC) should be a core revenue stream for copper smelters but spot charges have been negative since the start of the year and the mid-year negotiations have also kicked off with a negative number..Low treatment charges feed copper's perennial bull narrative of too little mine supply but the current implosion in processing fees is as much about too much demand from too many new smelters..The imbalance looks unsustainable, particularly if smelters accept a negative charge for the mid-year talks, which set the price for much higher volumes than the spot market..But equally unsustainable is the copper industry's preference for pricing concentrates on an annual or semi-annual basis..The good news for smelters is that spot treatment charges appear to have stopped falling. The bad news is that they have done no more than stabilise at $-45 per ton (TC) and -4.5 cents per lb (RC) level, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence..Smelters which chose to lock in tonnages over the full year are partly insulated but this year's benchmark terms of $21.5 per ton were also the lowest in at least 20 years..The mid-year negotiations look likely to generate a still lower outcome, although smelters will understandably balk at locking in a negative TCRC for contracts that could run into 2026..Smelters have a couple of financial life-lines in the form of valuable by-products such as gold and silver. They also produce sulphuric acid, which has been rising sharply in price in China thanks to demand from the phosphate fertilizer industry..But a copper smelter's main source of income should really be copper, which is clearly not the case right now..It's not as if mines haven't been increasing production. Global output rose by 2.1% in 2023, 2.8% in 2024 and by another 1.2% in the first quarter of this year, according to the International Copper Study Group..China's imports of copper concentrates have been running strong, hitting a new annual high of 28.2 million tons bulk weight last year and up 7.5% year-on-year in the first four months of 2025..It's just that too much Chinese smelting capacity has been brought on line too quickly with newcomers chasing down available tonnage..Scrap is an alternative feed for some but this is an increasingly competitive market and Chinese imports of copper recyclable material are no more than flat so far this year relative to 2024..The rapid scale-up of Chinese processing capacity is clear to see in the country's production of refined metal. May output jumped by almost 14% year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics..Local data provider Shanghai Metal Market estimates production so far this year has grown by 11% over 2024 levels..A couple of Western smelters have already closed under the margin squeeze..Glencore(GLEN.L), opens new tabplaced its Pasar smelter in the Philippines on care and maintenance in February. Sinomine did the same with itsTsumeb plantin Namibia earlier this month..But Chinese operators are doubling down in what appears to be a last-man-standing strategy..The world's mines are not going to be able to lift collective output by the same margin as China has increased smelting capacity..And the stresses in the raw materials supply chain are only going to get worse asnew smeltersfire up in Indonesia, ending the country's role as a key concentrates supplier to Asian smelters..Something will have to give, particularly since Chinese copper demand is expected to cool due to ascaling-backof subsidies for the over-heated solar panel sector..But with Chinese smelters not blinking, it could take some time before the current supply-demand imbalance is corrected through more capacity closures..That means more stress also on the industry's price discovery process, which is still rooted in annual deals..There has been some movement towards quarterly pricing and even spot pricing but largely in China..This, as smelters are finding out, is a big problem if the annual price is a negative number. A negative mid-year deal sets an ominous precedent..Markets such as iron ore have moved away from annual benchmarks which couldn't capture spot price volatility or sudden shifts in supply dynamics..Even lithium, widely perceived as too bespoke a commodity for standardised futures trading, can now be hedged on a liquid CME contract..It may be time for copper smelters to have a fundamental rethink about how they price their role in the processing chain. Because right now they're quite literally giving money away to the miners..The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters"

2025-06-21,"Houston like a local:.Houston isn't known as a tourist destination, but it should be. The largest city in Texas is home to Chevron and dozens of other oil companies, the world's biggest medical center, and the U.S. astronaut corps, butalso a vibrant food scene, theaters that rival those of the Big Apple, expansive art museums, and the definitive American rodeo..I've lived in the Bayou City since 2016 and have found it more collegial than New York and far warmer than North Dakota — two places I was previously based for Reuters,where I cover critical minerals and the energy transition as a senior correspondent. To boot, Houston is surprisingly affordable for a city of 2.3 million people (and counting). And,as the hometownof music superstar Beyoncé, entrepreneur and film producer Howard Hughes, and Olympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles — just to name a few — its cultural exports are known across the globe..Here's my guide to exploring this gem of a city like a local:.Getting around: Houston loves its cars and thus loves its highways. Perhaps that shouldn't be surprising for a region that loves its oil. (Texas accounts for 42% of U.S. oil production.) But public transportation and bike lanes are growing in popularity. A light-rail line opened in 2004 to connect downtown withRice Universityand theUniversity of Houston,the city's two most prominent institutions of higher learning. Downtown features a maze of undergroundpedestrian tunnels to avoid the brutal summer humidity, although be warned: They're confusing to navigate..George Bush Intercontinental Airport — the city's largest — is about 20 miles (32 km) north of downtown and can take an hour or more during rush hour to reach. William P. Hobby Airport is 10 miles (16 km) from downtown and easier to access, but it mostly handles domestic flights. Sadly, no trains run to either..Must-eats (and drinks):Houston is known for its Tex-Mex, a fusion of Texan and northern Mexican cuisines overflowing with flour tortillas, chili and queso. The best flavors are atNinfa's on Navigationwhere founder Ninfa Rodriguez Laurenzo in 1973 served the world's first fajitas (yes, she invented them). Another great Tex-Mex spot isEl Tiempo Cantinain the LGBT-friendly Montrose neighborhood..BCN Taste & Traditionhas an amazing cherry gazpacho soup — and Salvador Dalí originals hanging on the walls. The curry at British pubThe Red Lionwill knock your socks off.Brasserie 19is the brunch spot favored by Houston's cultural elite. AndUchi's wagyu kushiyaki is exquisite, though reservations at the Japanese eatery are tough to procure so try for the first-come, first-served happy hour bar seating, starting daily at 4 p.m..Drop of the Creator Spirits Company,one of the several independently owned distilleries and breweries across the city, makes a delicious spin on the classic Sazerac cocktail known as the Snazzy Sazzy. It's the perfect drink to unwind with after a day of exploring..The hot ticket: Houston'sAlley Theatre— home to one of the only full-time, regional theater companies in the country — is a must-visit, with performances running throughout the year. Each December,the Alley magically reinterprets the Charles Dickens classic ""A Christmas Carol."".Every March, the city hosts theHouston Livestock Show and Rodeoduring which young kids clasp the backs of running sheep until they fall off, an event known as mutton busting. (Seriously.).For art enthusiasts,the Renaissance art at theMuseum of Fine Arts, Houstonand Surrealist works at theMenil Collectionare well worth your time, as is theRothko Chapel, a contemplative space adorned with 14 originals from abstract painter Mark Rothko..For an immersive experience:In 1926, Houston built an underground drinking water reservoir near downtown. Today, it's been decommissioned and turned into a public arts venue known as theBuffalo Bayou Park Cistern. The acoustics are amazing (echoes reverberate for 17 seconds) and the gargantuan space challenges visitors' perception of space and time. While you're there, take a stroll or jog around the surrounding Buffalo Bayou Park, which ambles for 2.3 miles (3.7 km) and is filled with stately Southern Live Oak trees and a plethora of other native plants nestled alongside the bayou's hushed waters..Local news source: The Houston Chronicle and its affiliate Chron.com are staples, but blogs CultureMap Houston and Space City Weather are also must-reads for visitors and locals alike..Biggest misconception: Houston isn't really Texas. Yes, it's in Texas, but I often tell friends and family that Houston is in a class of its own: politically, socially and culturally. Unlike much of Texas, it tilts liberal (voters elected a lesbian mayor three timesstarting in 2009, for example); is more ethnically diverse than the rest of the state (and indeed, the rest of the nation's big cities); and as a sprawling metropolis with no zoning laws, it's developed in some, err, unique ways, with apartment complexes often sprouting next to industrial warehouses and funeral homes neighboring elementary schools..Ideal spot for a sunset: There's a grassy knoll near theWaugh Drive Bat Colonywhere you can sit and watch more than 300,000 Mexican free-tailed bats — the state's official flying mammal — take flight at dusk over Buffalo Bayou. It's a favorite with children, especially..CITY MEMO DATA POINTS.Languages spoken: 140.Price of a cup of coffee: $3.50 atTenfold Coffee, which buys its beans directly from farmers across Burundi, Ethiopia and five other countries..Price of a bottle of water: 78 cents for Texas spring water atH-E-B, the iconic Houston grocery store..Price of a gallon of gasoline: $2.49 at a Murphy USA branch in the leafy Westbury neighborhood.

He also singled, walked, stole a base and scored four times in a 9-4 victory..Raleigh sent a fastball over the fence in center for a 1-0 lead in the first inning..In the seventh, he broke a 4-4 tie by hitting another fastball into the seats in left for a two-run homer.

""Staying on time for the heater is a must. If you're on time for the heater, you can give yourself a chance with the other stuff. I think he's just so dangerous because he's tough to pitch to. He hits breaking balls, he hits the hard stuff. He hits just about everything, and he's got power to all fields. He's just a really difficult out."".Raleigh, 28, got a chance to meet Bench at the Rawlings Gold Glove banquet last offseason and cherished the opportunity..""What an amazing baseball mind,"" Raleigh said after the win on Friday.

Really fun experience, and very grateful for that opportunity and I learned a lot."".Raleigh said he has been consistent with his approach to hitting..""Trying to stay through the middle, looking for a mistake to hit,"" he said.

It helps him get some length into games."".The Mariners plan to start Emerson Hancock on Saturday..Hancock (3-2, 4.48 ERA) is coming off an exceptional outing as well, allowing two hits and no runs over seven innings in a 6-0 win against the Cleveland Guardians last Sunday..The right-hander made his only start against the Cubs on April 13, 2024, and took the loss after yielding two runs and four hits over six innings in a 4-1 defeat..--Field Level Media"

2025-06-22,"Nvidia vs Microsoft Stock: Which Will Reach $4 Trillion First?:Key Points  Nvidia and Microsoft both benefit from the increasing spending and excitement around artificial intelligence.  Nvidia maintains strong revenue growth for its data center chips.  Microsoft's cloud computing revenue is accelerating while its enterprise software benefits from new AI features.  10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›     At the end of 2024, tech analyst Dan Ives predicted Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) would all reach a $4 trillion valuation in 2025. He expected Apple to hit the mark first, followed by Nvidia, and then Microsoft. But I think he got the order reversed: Microsoft will reach a $4 trillion valuation first. Both Nvidia and Microsoft currently have market caps around $3.5 trillion, while Apple has seen its stock fall to about $3 trillion in market cap. The leading tech giants have received a clear boost from artificial intelligence (AI) spending, but Apple has struggled to make headway in advanced AI capabilities. As a result, it looks like either Nvidia or Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion valuation threshold first. And despite strong operating results from Nvidia, Microsoft looks to have the edge.   Image source: Getty Images.   Can Nvidia's exponential growth continue? Nvidia's strong results over the last few years were driven by unprecedented growth in its data center business. For the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year. The hyperscale customers like Microsoft are buying Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can produce them. In fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year.   However, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including Microsoft. If those customers pull back on AI spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth. It faces plenty of challenges from other GPU makers and custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. Several of them are working to build chips for both training and inference that offer better price performance than Nvidia's all-in-one solution.   So, while the GPU maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. The stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. That's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as Nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in AI, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations.   Story continues   Is Microsoft steadily marching toward $4 trillion? Microsoft has seen strong results for its Azure cloud computing platform over the last few years, thanks, in part, to its partnership with OpenAI. The company invested an additional $10 billion in the generative AI leader at the start of 2023, boosting its cloud platform as well as its own enterprise software's AI capabilities.   The relationship between the two companies has become strained as Microsoft develops its own AI models, but it still looks to have cemented its position in the cloud. To that end, the company is investing heavily to build out its data center capacity. It expects to finish out its fiscal year with $80 billion in capital expenditures, mostly related to building out AI data centers. Management continued to tell investors it's supply-constrained during its third-quarter earnings call. Azure revenue growth is accelerating, up 33% in the most recent quarter. That's faster than its competitors, and a large portion of that is driven by demand for AI training and inference. As a result, Microsoft should see continued strong revenue growth for Azure, driving the entire business's performance.   The rest of the company benefits from AI as well. Its Microsoft 365 service integrates its Copilot software, and has increased both commercial and consumer customers at a double-digit rate. The company's Copilot Studio makes it easy for enterprises to integrate their own data into an AI system to build their own specialized AI agents, further locking them into its enterprise software ecosystem and paving the way for growth. Microsoft stock is priced on par with Nvidia's shares right now. But the former company's diversified business with both enterprise software and cloud computing stands on very solid footing, with those two areas showing strong growth and improving profitability. That makes it more attractive as a stock and more likely to reach the $4 trillion mark first. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

2025-06-22,"Dogecoin Drops 8% but Shows V-Shaped Recovery in Boost for Bulls:Dogecoin is showing early signs of recovery after a steep intraday drop that pushed prices to their lowest levels in weeks. The sell-off, triggered by broader macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, found strong buyer interest near the $0.151 level, with volume spiking to 828 million units during the capitulation. Since then, DOGE has stabilized near $0.157, forming higher lows and hinting at a potential bottoming structure. News Background Global economic pressures — from escalating trade disputes to hawkish central bank stances — have weighed heavily on crypto markets. DOGE, often viewed as a bellwether for retail sentiment, bore the brunt of risk-off flows. However, despite the volatility, network activity has remained stable, and on-chain data shows signs of accumulation. Analysts point to the $0.151 level as a crucial support zone following the 8% plunge. Central banks continue to signal concern over inflation, and with crypto markets reacting sharply to macro headlines, DOGE’s ability to recover from its lows may attract short-term traders looking for signs of a rebound.  Price Action DOGE dropped sharply from $0.164 to $0.151 during the 21:00 hour on June 21, with volume exploding to 828M—the highest hourly tally in over a week. This marked a clear capitulation point, followed by a modest recovery as buyers stepped in. Price has since rebounded to the $0.157 level, forming a short-term consolidation zone. In the most recent session, DOGE printed a series of higher lows, including a small breakout attempt at 06:57, when volume spiked to nearly 8M units. According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data, immediate resistance now sits at $0.157- $0.160, while support remains firm at $0.151. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE posted a 7.9% range over 24 hours, falling from $0.164 to $0.151. The capitulation event at 21:00 drew 828M in volume, confirming $0.151 as major support. Price rebounded to $0.157, where it’s now consolidating on declining volatility. Higher lows suggest a potential early accumulation pattern forming. The resistance zone sits at $0.157–$0.160; bulls need a close above $0.160 for breakout confirmation. Support at $0.151 backed by extreme volume and a V-shaped bounce. MACD turning positive; RSI neutral at ~48, signaling room for upside if momentum builds."

2025-06-22,"Prediction: Buying Enterprise Products Partners Today Could Set You Up for Life:Key Points Enterprise Products Partners can set investors up with a lifetime of solid and growing passive income. The company is one of the most consistent in the midstream space. Using a DRIP is a great way to set you up for a meaningful income stream when it comes time for retirement. 10 stocks we like better than Enterprise Products Partners ›   Buying stock in midstream energy giant Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) could set you up for life. Now, that doesn't mean the stock is going to skyrocket and make you a millionaire overnight on a modest investment. Instead, what buying Enterprise's stock will give you is a lifetime of solid and growing passive income. Enterprise currently sports an attractive forward yield of 6.9%. But the beauty of Enterprise is that the pipeline management company has also increased its distribution in each of the past 26 years, both in good and bad energy markets. Last quarter, the company increased its quarterly payout by 3.9% year over year to $0.535 per unit.  If Enterprise were to increase its distribution by a similar amount moving forward, its distribution would approximately double over the next 20 years. With a payout of nearly $4.50 per share by that time, your ""personal yield"" on an investment in Enterprise at that time would be a little over 13.6% based on the stock's current levels today. While ""personal yield"" is not a standard financial term, it is simply the yield you are getting based on your personal cost basis (the stock's current dividend/your cost basis).   Image source: Getty Images.   Now, if Enterprise were to keep raising its distribution at this same pace for the next 30 years, its payout would get to $6.75 per share each year. That would be about a 20% personal yield if you bought the stock today. So if you're between 30 and 40 years old, that would set you up with a nice, very high-yield income stream just as you were entering retirement. Enterprise operates as an MLP, which benefits DRIP investors Another attractive thing with Enterprise is that it's structured as a master limited partnership (MLP), which means it pays distributions instead of traditional dividends. The key difference is tax treatment. A large portion of these distributions is typically classified as return of capital, which isn't taxed immediately. Instead, it lowers your cost basis in the stock. Once your cost basis hits zero, any additional distributions are taxed as capital gains, and when you sell, you'll pay taxes on the deferred portion of distributions at the ordinary income tax rate, which should be lower when you're retired. The rest of the gains are taxed as capital gains.   Story Continues Because of its preferential tax treatment, many investors also don't take the distribution when they are younger. Instead, they use what is called a DRIP, or dividend reinvestment plan. These are plans offered by companies where they will automatically reinvest your distributions back into the stock at no commission in lieu of a cash payment. Using a DRIP to reinvest your distributions over a couple of decades can turn your initial investment into a significant income stream when it's time to retire and start collecting the payouts.What makes Enterprise an attractive stock to buy now?What helps separate Enterprise from other high-yield stocks is its consistency. The company has always taken a conservative approach, which has allowed it to weather any economic or energy market storms. Enterprise owns one of the largest integrated midstream companies in the U.S., and it is particularly strong in the natural gas liquids (NGLs) space.NGLs, which include ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, are high-value by-products of natural gas and crude oil production. Ethane is one of the main feedstocks in the petrochemical industry to produce plastics and chemicals, while butane can also be used as a petrochemical feedstock, as well as for heating and cooking. The other three tend to be blended into fuels. There is also a large U.S. export market for both propane and butane, and Enterprise is heavily involved throughout the entire NGL value chain.Meanwhile, the company takes several measures to ensure the predictability of its cash flows. Approximately 85% of its business historically comes from fee-based services that aren't impacted by energy prices or commodity spreads. At the same time, it likes to include take-or-pay provisions in its initial contracts, which assures it gets paid no matter whether customers use its services. It also attaches yearly inflation escalators to its contracts, as well.Additionally, Enterprise has always maintained a conservative balance sheet and robust distribution coverage ratio. Building pipelines and other midstream assets is a capital-intensive business, so midstream companies carry debt. Given the strong cash flows and predictable nature of midstream assets, many companies target leverage -- net debt/adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- in the 4x to 4.5x times range.However, Enterprise has always taken a more cautious approach, ending Q1 with leverage of only 3.1 times and an investment-grade credit rating on its debt. Today, the company largely self-funds its growth projects through its cash flows, although it will take on some additional debts to pursue attractive growth projects.At the same time, the company's distribution is well covered by its distributable cash flow, which is its operating cash flow minus maintenance capital expenditures. Last quarter, its coverage ratio was 1.7 times, which gives it ample room to continue to increase its distribution in the years ahead.Overall, Enterprise is a sleep-well-at-night stock that can help set up investors for life, offering solid price appreciation potential to go along with an attractive and rising distribution.Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

2025-06-22,"Best money market account rates today, June 22, 2025 (best account provides 4.41% APY):Find out how much you could earn with today’s money market account rates. The Federal Reserve cut its target rate three times in 2024. So deposit rates — including money market account (MMA) rates — have started falling. It’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance. Overview of money market account rates today The national average money market account rate stands at 0.62%, according to the FDIC. Even so, some of the top accounts are currently offering rates of 4% APY and up. Since these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a money market account now to take advantage of today’s high rates. Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today:  See our picks for the 10 best money market accounts available today>> Additionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.  How much interest can I earn with a money market account? The amount of interest you can earn from a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (money market account interest typically compounds daily). Say you put $1,000 in an MMA at the average interest rate of 0.64% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,006.42 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $6.42 in interest.  Now let’s say you choose a high-yield money market account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest. The more you deposit in a money market account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a money market account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest. ​​"

The Mortgage Bankers Association's latest forecast is for 30-year rates to remain mostly unchanged and near 6.8% through September, ending the year close to 6.7%.

Refinance interest rates  Monthly mortgage payment calculator Use the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.  Our free mortgage calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest. 30-year vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates The average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.68%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan. The average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.90% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals. A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.  Let’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.68% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,932, and you’d pay $395,468 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000. If you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.90% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,515. But you’d only pay $152,660 in interest over the years. Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages With a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though. An adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term. Adjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other. Dig deeper: Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages How to get a low mortgage rate Mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes. Waiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate. How to choose a mortgage lender To find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score. When choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.

According to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.68%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.90%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas. What's a good mortgage rate right now? The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.68% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Are mortgage rates expected to drop? Mortgage rates aren't expected to drop drastically in the near future, though they may inch down now and then."
2025-06-22,"HELOC rates today, June 22, 2025: The interest rate on a home equity line of credit moves even lower (to 6.68%):HELOC interest rates were even lower today, adding to a nice downward move yesterday. The continuing popularity of HELOCs means lenders are competing to win their share of home equity business with favorable interest rates. Homeowners with low mortgage rates on their primary mortgage may be looking to make home improvements or have other uses for the growing value locked inside their house. Known as a second mortgage, home equity line of credit accounts, and the lump sum version — the home equity loan — can be an excellent option for home equity access. Now, the details on HELOC rates today. Dig deeper: HELOC vs. home equity loan: Tapping your equity without refinancing  HELOC rates Sunday, June 22, 2025 According to Zillow, the rate on a 10-year HELOC dropped an additional two basis points to 6.68% today, after a nice retreat yesterday. The same rate is also available on 15- and 20-year HELOCS. VA-backed HELOCs ticked up three basis points to 6.33%. Homeowners have a staggering amount of value tied up in their houses — more than $34 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the third-largest amount of home equity on record. With mortgage rates lingering in the high 6% range, homeowners are not going to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. Why let go of your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?  Accessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative. How lenders determine HELOC interest rates HELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which today is 7.50%. If a lender added 1% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 8.50%. However, you will find reported HELOC rates are much lower than that. That's because lenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home. And average national HELOC rates can include ""introductory"" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate. How a HELOC works You don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage, such as a home equity line of credit. The best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat. Meanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.  Look for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later Today, LendingTree is offering a HELOC rate of 6.50% for a credit line of $150,000. That's likely an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity. The power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow. HELOC rates today: FAQs What is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now? Rates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from nearly 7% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are. Is it a good idea to get a HELOC right now? For homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably one of the best times to get a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt. What is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit? If you take out the full $50,000 from a line of credit on a $400,000 home, your payment may be around $395 per month with a variable interest rate beginning at 8.75%. That's for a HELOC with a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period. That sounds good, but remember, it winds up being a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and pay back the balance in a much shorter period of time."

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in recent years. Its share price has soared more than 2,000% since January 2023, achieving a return that would have turned a $5,000 investment into $107,000 over that period. Will Palantir shareholders see similar gains over the next decade? Here's what investors should know.   Image source: Getty Images.   Palantir is a leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms Palantir provides data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) software that enables businesses to manage and make sense of complex information. Its platforms have applications across almost every industry. As an example, Archer Aviation recently adopted Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) products to improve its aircraft manufacturing capabilities, and the companies will collaborate to design critical aviation systems in the future.  Forrester Research recognized Palantir as a leader in AI and machine learning platforms last August, awarding its AIP product higher scores than similar tools from Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and Databricks, a private company currently valued at $75 billion. The report highlighted differentiated software architecture as a key strength. ""Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market,"" wrote analyst Mike Gualtieri. Palantir continued to show near-flawless execution in the first quarter. Revenue increased 39% to $884 million, marking the seventh consecutive acceleration (as shown in the chart below), due to particularly strong growth in the U.S. commercial and government segments. And non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased 70% to $334 million. Management attributed the strong results to the demand for AIP.   Shown above is Palantir's quarterly revenue and non-GAAP net income. The percentages show year-on-year growth. Palantir's revenue growth has accelerate for seven consecutive quarters. Non-GAAP = non-generally accepted accounting principles.   Importantly, Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar told analysts on the first-quarter earnings call, ""Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and in the years ahead."" That is encouraging because International Data Corporation estimates AI platform spending will increase by 40% annually through 2028.   Story Continues Palantir is the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 by a wide marginPalantir must increase at least 20 times in value (equivalent to a 1,900% return) over the next decade to turn $5,000 into $100,000. As mentioned, the stock has already notched returns of that magnitude once, and it did so in much less time. Shares advanced by over 2,000% in the last 30 months.It's worth noting that four companies in the S&P 500 achieved sufficient gains to turn $5,000 into $100,000 in the last decade, as listed below. Palantir is not included because the company did not go public until 2020.Nvidia: +26,530% Advanced Micro Devices: +4,790% Axon Enterprise: +2,180% Texas Pacific Land: +2,060% However, Palantir's share price is unlikely to increase 20-fold during the next decade. I say that because the company is already worth $324 billion. Multiplying that by 20 would bring its market value to $6.5 trillion, which seems implausible, given that Microsoft is currently the world's largest company and its market value is just $3.5 trillion.Additionally, Palantir stock would need to gain 35% annually over the next decade to achieve a total return of 1,900%. That seems particularly unlikely, considering shares already trade at a shockingly expensive 109 times sales. For context, the next-closest member of the S&P 500 is Texas Pacific Land at 35 times sales.Consider this: Even if Palantir trades at 40 times sales in 10 years (which would still be the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 at current prices), revenue would need to increase by 49% annually during that period for the company to achieve a $6.5 trillion market value. Palantir's revenue increased by only 39% last quarter, so the odds of revenue growing at 49% annually for the next 10 years are remote at best.Here's the bottom line: Palantir is executing on a tremendous market opportunity, but the current valuation is absurd. Personally, I think investors should steer clear of the stock at its current price, or at least keep their position sizing very small. At some point, valuation will matter, and Palantir shares could crash.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Find out how you can access this $1B private real estate fund (with as little as $10)     “Our Sacramento team’s work ethic and incredible drive have enabled us to build Blue Diamond into what it is today,” CEO and president Kai Bockmann told ABC News. “However, the challenges of running a plant from these historical buildings has become too costly and inefficient. Streamlining our manufacturing plants is the right business move.” End of an era Founded in 1910, Blue Diamond has long been a fixture in California’s agricultural sector. In the meantime, the cooperative is offering severance packages, relocation support and incentives to 600 employees to help with the transition. Despite the company's assurances, the closure has sparked concerns about Sacramento’s ability to support major businesses.   “Proof is in the pudding,” Sanjay Varshney, a finance professor at Sacramento State University., told ABC News. “Blue Diamond walking away is just another sign that there's something wrong with how we are doing business here.” Varshney cited Sacramento’s high cost of living, burdensome regulatory environment and business-unfriendly conditions as key deterrents. He dismissed the idea that international trade or tariffs were the main reasons for the closure. Read more: Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it What to do when facing layoffs A layoff can make a big impact in your financial situation, not to mention your emotional well-being. The good news is you can help navigate the fallout with a clear game plan. Know your benefits and severance: Insist on everything in writing and review every aspect of your exit package including your severance pay, company-sponsored health coverage and any outplacement services.   Story Continues   If your employer-provided health insurance ends, consider COBRA coverage or explore plans through Covered California or Healthcare.gov. Losing a job qualifies you for a special enrollment period. Apply for unemployment insurance immediately: File a claim through your state’s unemployment office. Unemployment benefits become available only after your claim is processed, so don’t delay.   In California, most workers qualify for 50% of their regular wages, up to $450 per week for as long as 26 weeks, though exact amounts depend on prior earnings and state rules. Reassess your finances: Review your monthly expenses and cut nonessentials. Use emergency savings wisely and contact lenders or utility companies to discuss bill assistance programs or payment deferrals if needed. Update your resume and tap your network: Network with former colleagues, industry contacts and career counsellors. Inform your LinkedIn network, for example, that you're open to work and consider attending local job fairs or virtual networking events.   Consider retraining or upskilling: Free or low-cost training programs are available through local workforce development centers and platforms like Coursera or LinkedIn Learning. Focus on in-demand fields like health care, logistics and technology. Blue Diamond’s shutdown echoes a nationwide surge in layoffs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 1.8 million workers have lost their jobs in 2025. In Sacramento, the loss of a century-old employer underscores that even the most established businesses can falter amid shifting economic currents — and highlights the urgency of diversifying the region’s economic base.

2025-06-22,"Trump claims tariffs could 'eliminate' income tax for Americans making under $200,000:Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images   Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. President Donald Trump says tariffs could deliver a financial windfall for everyday Americans — by wiping out their income taxes. “When tariffs cut in, many people’s income taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,” Trump declared in a Truth Social post on April 27. “Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year.” That’s a bold promise, especially considering that only 14.4% of U.S. households earned more than $200,000 annually in 2023, according to Census Bureau data. In other words, if Trump’s vision holds true, the vast majority of Americans would pay no income tax at all. Don't miss Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

But don’t celebrate just yet. While Trump is optimistic, experts say the math simply doesn’t add up. Economists Erica York and Huaqun Li of the Tax Foundation were blunt, explaining in a response on April 28 that “the individual income tax raises more than 27 times as much revenue as tariffs currently do,” and “even eliminating income taxes for a subset of taxpayers, such as those earning $200,000 or less, would require significantly higher replacement revenues than tariffs could generate.” They estimate that the tariffs Trump has imposed and scheduled as of April 2025 would generate nearly $167 billion in new federal tax revenue in 2025 — covering less than 25% of the cost of eliminating income taxes for people earning below $200,000. While Trump’s proposal faces serious doubts, policy changes aren’t the only route to lowering tax bills. Here are two powerful assets that everyday investors can use to their advantage. Stocks Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business, once said that if you’re trying to build wealth, you have “an obligation to pay as little tax as possible.” His advice? Keep it simple: “You buy stocks, you never sell them, you borrow against them.” Galloway broke it down with an example: “You own $100 in Amazon stock. You need money to buy something. Instead of selling the stock, and let’s say it’s gone up 50% ... You would have to realize a capital gain and pay long-term capital gains [tax] on that $50 gain. No, just borrow against it and let the stock continue to grow.”   Story Continues This strategy allows investors to tap into the value of their portfolios without triggering a taxable event. Because capital gains are only taxed when realized, borrowing against appreciated assets lets investors access cash while deferring taxes.Meanwhile, the investments themselves can continue to grow. And since the interest on the loan is often smaller than the tax bill from a sale, this approach can be a powerful tool for preserving and compounding wealth over time.Of course, not all investors want to pick individual stocks — and you don’t have to. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of our time, recommends a much simpler path: buying a cross-section of the American economy.“In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index,” Buffett has stated, meaning invest in an S&P 500 index fund. This straightforward approach gives investors exposure to the top American companies on the stock market, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading.The beauty of this approach is its accessibility — anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it.Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on insteadReal estateReal estate has long been a go-to asset for building wealth — and one of the reasons is the generous tax treatment it receives.When you earn rental income from an investment property, you can claim deductions for a wide range of expenses, such as mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance and ongoing maintenance and repairs.Real estate investors also benefit from depreciation — a tax deduction that recognizes the gradual wear and tear of a property over time.Today, you don’t need to be a millionaire or buy property outright to benefit from real estate investing.For example, Homeshares opens the door to the $30-plus trillion U.S. home equity market — a space that was once reserved almost exclusively for institutional investors. With a minimum investment of $25,000, accredited investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.With risk-adjusted target returns ranging from 14% to 17%, this approach provides an effective, hands-off way to invest in owner-occupied residential properties across regional markets.If you're an accredited investor looking for larger returns through commercial real estate, First National Realty Partners (FNRP) could be a better fit with a $50,000 minimum investment requirement.Specializing in grocery-anchored retail, FNRP offers a turnkey solution for investors, allowing them to passively earn distribution income while benefiting from the firm’s expertise and deal leadership.FNRP has developed relationships with the nation’s largest essential-needs brands, including Kroger, Walmart and Whole Foods, and provides insights into the best properties both on and off-market.

2025-06-22,"Best high-yield savings interest rates today, June 22, 2025 (best accounts offering 4.0% APY):Find out how much you could earn with today’s savings rates. The Federal Reserve cut its target rate three times in late 2024, which means savings interest rates are falling from their historic highs. It’s important to be sure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a savings account. The following is a breakdown of savings interest rates today and where to find the best offers. Overview of savings interest rates today The national average savings account rate stands at 0.38%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.06%, reflecting a sharp rise in a short period of time. As of June 22, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.31% APY. This rate is offered by VIO Bank and there is no minimum opening deposit required. Since these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a high-yield savings account now to take advantage of today’s high rates. Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:  How much interest can I earn with a savings account? The amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily). Say you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.42% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,004.12 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $4.12 in interest. Now let’s say you choose a high-yield savings account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest. The more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a high-yield savings account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest. ​​ Read more: What is a good savings account rate?

2025-06-22,"Best CD rates today, June 22, 2025 (lock in up to 4.4% APY):Find out how much you could earn by locking in a high CD rate today. A certificate of deposit (CD) allows you to lock in a competitive rate on your savings and help your balance grow. However, rates vary widely across financial institutions, so it’s important to ensure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a CD. The following is a breakdown of CD rates today and where to find the best offers. Overview of CD rates today Historically, longer-term CDs offered higher interest rates than shorter-term CDs. Generally, this is because banks would pay better rates to encourage savers to keep their money on deposit longer. However, in today’s economic climate, the opposite is true. As of June 22, 2025, the highest CD rate is 4.4% APY, offered by Western Alliance Bank on its 3-month CD. There is a $1 minimum opening deposit required.  How much interest can I earn with a CD? The amount of interest you can earn from a CD depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (CD interest typically compounds daily or monthly). Say you invest $1,000 in a one-year CD with 1.81% APY, and interest compounds monthly. At the end of that year, your balance would grow to $1,018.25 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus $18.25 in interest. Now let’s say you choose a one-year CD that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.74 over the same period, which includes $40.74 in interest.  The more you deposit in a CD, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a one-year CD at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance when the CD matures would be $10,407.42, meaning you’d earn $407.42 in interest. ​​ Read more: What is a good CD rate?  Up Next  What is a good CD rate in 2025?   How to avoid taxes on CD interest   What should you do once your CD matures?   Types of CDs When choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isn’t the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Here’s a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs: Bump-up CD: This type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the account’s term. However, you’re usually allowed to ""bump up"" your rate just once. No-penalty CD: Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty. Jumbo CD: These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In today’s CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much. Brokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank.

Three brand-name, non-tech stocks have completed forward splits in 2025 -- and there's more to picking out which company is next to split than a high share price. The logical candidate to split its stock next is a cash cow with a sustainable moat whose shares are, once again, within a stone's throw of an all-time high. 10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›   Although the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the premier attention-grabber for investors on Wall Street over the last two-plus years, it's far from the only trend responsible for lifting the broader market to new heights. Since 2024 began, the market's major stock indexes have been propelled by some of the most influential businesses announcing and completing stock splits. A stock split allows a publicly traded company the opportunity to cosmetically adjust its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. These changes are superficial in the sense that they don't affect a company's market cap or in any way impact its underlying operating performance.   Image source: Getty Images.   Splits can move a company's share price up or down, but there's a sizable variance in how these two types of splits are perceived by the investing community. Reverse splits, which increase a company's share price, are normally shunned by investors. Reverse splits are often enacted by struggling companies that are attempting to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange.  In comparison, investors typically love public companies that complete forward splits, which are designed to lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who can't buy fractional shares through their brokers. The businesses undertaking forward splits usually have rich histories of recurring profitability. While three brand-name businesses have taken the plunge and become the latest stock-split stocks this year, the split announcement that all of Wall Street is waiting for is officially back on the table. Non-tech companies are making their shares more accessible to everyday investors in 2025 Last year, more than a dozen high-profile companies announced a split, and a number of these companies were high-growth AI stocks, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Super Micro Computer, and Palo Alto Networks. The ""Class of 2025"" stock-split stocks all come from outside the tech sector. Wholesale industrial and construction supplies company Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST) was the first to cross the proverbial finish line by completing a 2-for-1 forward split after the close of trading on May 21. This was the ninth time since Fastenal's initial public offering in 1987 that it's completed a forward split, and it's a clear indication that the company's strong cyclical ties and on-site innovations are helping to strengthen its relationship with core clients.   Story Continues Following in Fastenal's footsteps was auto parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY), which effected a 15-for-1 forward split after trading ended on June 9. O'Reilly's stock has soared on the heels of a mammoth share-repurchase program that's seen the company buy back close to 60% of its outstanding shares since the start of 2011. O'Reilly's hub-and-spoke distribution model, which ensures that more than 153,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) can reach drivers and mechanics the same day or on an overnight basis, has also been a boon to sales.The third premier non-tech stock-split stock this year is automated electronic brokerage firm Interactive Brokers Group (NASDAQ: IBKR), which completed its first-ever forward split (4-for-1) after trading wrapped up on June 17. Interactive Brokers' investments in technology and automation, coupled with continued optimistic investor sentiment, have increased aggregate accounts and equity held on its platform, as well as the total number of trades being completed on a quarterly basis.There's more to picking out Wall Street's next stock-split stock than a high share priceAside from forward stock-split stocks (often) out-innovating and out-executing their peers, companies completing forward splits have a knack for outperforming Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500.Based on an analysis by Bank of America Global Research, since 1980, companies have gained an average of 25.4% in the 12 months following their initial forward split announcement. In comparison, the S&P 500 has averaged an 11.9% increase over these same 12-month periods. This historical outperformance is why investors gravitate toward stock-split stocks and often try to guess which brand-name company will announce a split next.But keep in mind that there's more to picking out Wall Street's next stock-split stock than locating a company with a high share price.Some companies with a high share price have demonstrated no interest in conducting a split. For instance, Costco Wholesale's (NASDAQ: COST) board of directors feels confident that its shareholders have access to fractional-share purchasing through online brokers.Even though its stock is hovering around $975 per share, as of this writing on June 19, Costco's board is in no rush to announce a split. Given Costco's inherent competitive size advantage, as well as its membership-based model that keeps customers loyal to the brand, we're likely to see its share price extend well past $1,000.The composition of a company's shareholder base matters, too. If an overwhelming percentage of a company's shares are owned by institutional investors, there's not much of an incentive to conduct a split. Money managers aren't in need of a lower share price to purchase stock.Even though streaming services provider Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is trading more than $500 higher than it was the last time it completed a forward split, less than 20% of the company's shares are owned by non-institutional investors. Despite Netflix's growing streaming subscriber count and $1,200-plus share price, there's no immediate need to conduct a split, given its low retail investor ownership.  Image source: Getty Images.  The stock split announcement that all of Wall Street is waiting for is back on the tableWhile Fastenal, O'Reilly Automotive, and Interactive Brokers making their shares more accessible to everyday investors is a welcome sight, there's another highly influential company that appears primed for a stock split -- and the catch is it's never announced one before.Whereas every member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" has completed at least one split since going public, social media titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has not. But with its share price rebounding to $700 following the stock market's tariff-induced swoon in April, the possibility of a stock-split announcement is very much back on the table.Unlike Netflix, more than 27% of Meta's shares are held by everyday investors. This is a large enough percentage that a split would make sense.A forward split would also be a logical choice, given the strong likelihood of Meta's stock heading even higher.In March, Meta had an average of 3.43 billion people visiting its family of apps daily. This ""family"" includes social destinations like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger, among others. With no other social media destination offering as many eyeballs as Meta, advertisers are willing to pony up a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. More often than not, Meta is going to benefit from its strong ad-pricing power.Furthermore, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's company is sitting on a mountain of cash. It closed out the first quarter with more than $70 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and is pacing $96 billion in annual run-rate net cash from operations through the first three months of the year. Being a cash cow affords Meta the opportunity to aggressively invest in its AI-driven future, as well as to support its shareholders via a dividend and share buybacks.Best of all, Meta Platforms' stock remains reasonably inexpensive despite its run-up to nearly $700 per share. A sustained growth rate in the mid-teens, coupled with the company's historically conservative profit forecast, points to its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24 being a bargain.Wall Street is waiting for Meta Platforms to take the plunge and become the highlight stock-split stock of 2025. The case for that happening arguably grows stronger with each passing day.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Trinidad and Tobago (0-1-2, 2 points) would have leapfrogged Saudi Arabia for second with a victory..Justin Garcia nearly put Trinidad ahead in the sixth minute of second-half stoppage time, but his point-blank shot from the center of the box caromed off the crossbar..Al-Buraikan's tying goal also involved the woodwork.

2025-06-23,"Analysts react as markets brace for Iran response to US attack:.SINGAPORE, June 23 (Reuters) - Globalshares slippedon Monday while oil prices briefly hit five-month highs and the dollar firmed as the world held its breath to see ifIran would retaliateagainst U.S. attacks on its nuclear sites..Market reaction to the weekend escalation of the conflict in the Middle East has been subdued so far as investors remain in wait-and-see mode..Here are some comments from market analysts:.CAROL KONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY:.""The price action in response to the escalating Middle East conflict has been muted so far as markets wait and see how Iran responds. Judging by the small fall in FOMC rate cut pricing by year-end, there are more worries about the positive inflationary impact of the Middle East conflict than the negative economic impact. The currency markets will be at the mercy of comments and actions from the Iranian, Israeli and U.S. governments. The risks are clearly skewed to further upside in the safe haven currencies if the parties escalate the conflict."".CHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE:.""Markets appear to be treating the U.S. strikes on Iran as a contained event for now, rather than the start of a broader war. The muted haven flows suggest investors are still assuming this is a one-off escalation, not a disruption to global oil supply or trade..""Markets may be responding not to the escalation itself, but to the perception that it could reduce longer-term uncertainty. If Iran’s nuclear capabilities are seen as meaningfully set back, some investors may interpret that as a de-escalation in disguise — a geopolitical risk removed, rather than added..""That said, any sign of Iranian retaliation or threat to the Strait of Hormuz could quickly shift sentiment and force markets to reprice geopolitical risk more aggressively."".PRASHANT NEWNAHA, SENIOR ASIA-PACIFIC RATES STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, SINGAPORE:.""The market reaction to weekend developments has been muted to state the least. The price action implies this will be a short-lived conflict, that escalation will ultimately lead to de-escalation."".SHOKI OMORI, CHIEF DESK STRATEGIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO:.""On Monday, in light of weekend geopolitical risk events in the Middle East, market participants adopted a wait-and-see stance. Although the market initially anticipated a bull-flattening of the JGB curve following last week's unexpectedly large reduction in 20-year bond issuance, muted movements in U.S. interest rates, combined with a shift in sentiment toward dollar buying rather than selling, made it challenging for investors to take decisive positions."".VASU MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OCBC, SINGAPORE:.""Much depends on what Iran will do next, but the shock and awe of the US attack and the warning from Trump not to retaliate or suffer significant consequences, may prevent Iran’s leaders from responding aggressively."".""Investors should prepare for more volatility in the coming days, and possibly even weeks, given the ongoing Middle East crisis and uncertainty about Trump’s tariff policy. However, these developments may not be the end of the global equity bull market as long it doesn’t result in sharply higher inflation and cause a global recession..""There is scope for safe havens like gold to continue rising as global uncertainties are likely to remain a fixture, and global central banks continue to diversify away from their US dollar holdings towards gold.

2025-06-23,"As gold prices surge, West Africa mine operators launch drones to detect wildcat miners:.TARKWA, Ghana, June 23 (Reuters) - As the afternoon sun beats down on Gold Fields' sprawling Tarkwa gold mine in southwestern Ghana, three men launch a drone into the clear sky, its cameras scanning the lush 210-square-kilometer tract for intruders..The drone spotted something unusual, and within 20 minutes a 15-person team including armed police arrived on the scene. They discovered abandoned clothing, freshly dug trenches, and rudimentary equipment amid pools ofmercury and cyanide-contaminatedwater. The equipment was left behind by so-called wildcat miners, who operate on the outskirts of many of the continent’s official mining ventures - putting at risk their own health, the environment and the official mine operator's profits..The team confiscated seven diesel-powered water pumps and a ""chanfan"" processing unit used to extract gold from riverbeds..The high-tech cat-and-mouse game is playing out with increasing frequency as record gold prices,now sitting above $3,300 per ounce, draw more unofficial activity - intensifying sometimes deadly confrontations between corporate concessions and artisanal miners in West Africa, according to dozens of mining executives and industry experts interviewed by Reuters..""Because of the vegetation cover, if you don't have eyes in the air, you won't know something destructive is happening,"" explains Edwin Asare, Gold Fields Tarkwa Mine's head of protection services. ""It's like you first get eyes in the sky to help you put boots on the ground.”.Almost 20 illicit miners have been killed in confrontations at major mining operations across the region since late 2024, including at Newmont(NEM.N), opens new tabandAngloGold Ashanti's(AU.N), opens new tabsites in Ghana and Guinea and Nordgold's Bissa Mine in Burkina Faso..There have been no reports of official mine staff injured. In some cases, clashes at corporate mines caused production halts of up to a month, prompting companies to press governments for more military protection..Sub-Saharan Africa's unofficial mining operations provide critical income for nearly 10 million people, according to a May United Nations report..In West Africa, three to five million people depend on unregulated mining, accounting for approximately 30% of its gold production, other industry data show, serving as economic lifelines in a region with few formal employment opportunities..Like 52-year old Famanson Keita in Senegal's gold-rich Kedougou region, many inhabitants grew up mining gold in their localities. With simple and traditional methods, they earned extra incomes to supplement those from farming until corporate miners arrived, relocating them from their communities and promising jobs and rapid development..""Those promises have not been fulfilled,"" said Keita. ""Many of our young people are employed in low-level, uncontracted jobs with little pay and no stability. Small-scale farming alone cannot sustain our families."".While local residents have long tried to eke out a living on the margins of corporate mines, much of the illicit activity, particularly in the region’s forests and large bodies of water, is now conducted with sophisticated digging and dredging equipment and funding from local cartels and foreigners, including from China..With rising central bank gold buying and broader geopolitical tensionspotentially pushing gold to $5,000 an ounce, Sahel-focused security and mining analyst Ulf Laessing warned that more violent confrontations around mining operations could be expected in the coming months..""The more the gold price rises, the more conflicts we will see between industrial and informal miners,"" said Laessing, head of the Sahel program at Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation..Nine wildcat miners were shot dead in January at AGA's Obuasi mine in Ghana when they cut open the fenced 110-square kilometer concession to scavenge gold, according to a source in the company who asked not to be identified..At AGA's Siguiri Mine, northeast of Guinea, hundreds of wildcat miners invaded the concession in February, prompting military intervention, according to a source familiar with the mine's operations..At least three wildcat miners were shot by guards while others were injured at Newmont’s Ahafo gold mining site in northwestern Ghana in January, police said..In Mali's gold-rich Kayes region, an excavator operator at an illegal mining site in Kenieba told Reuters that operations have expanded rapidly this year, with Chinese bosses deploying more equipment to new sites as gold prices climb. Reuters could not establish who such Chinese operators were, or whether they have any links to companies or official organizations..This year, Ghanaian authorities have been ransacking dozens of informal mining sites, arresting hundreds of locals and foreigners, particularly Chinese nationals, who operate unregulated gold operations in the country's vast forests, including protected areas and bodies of water..""Because of porous borders and weak regulations, the majority of their produce is smuggled,"" says Marc Ummel, researcher at Swissaid, ""depriving the countries of the full benefits.""Ghana lostmore than 229 metric tons of largely artisanal gold to smuggling between 2019 and 2023, according to Swissaid, which analysed export data within the period..Adama Soro, president of the West African Federation of Chambers of Mines, said artisanal miners also compete with large-scale miners for ore, shortening mines' lives. ""We're seeing artisanal miners digging up to 100 meters and impacting the ore body of the big miners, so we're losing money,"" he said..Miners are resorting to unconventional methods and increased spending at the expense of investment and community projects, said the head of a mining company in Ghana heavily affected by wildcat miners..The mine spends approximately half a million dollars annually on measures, including drone surveillance to combat wildcat mining, but still experiences frequent attacks, the source said..Nordgold, Galiano Gold(GAU.TO), opens new tab, B2Gold(BTO.TO), opens new taband Barrick Gold(ABX.TO), opens new tabhave all seen incursions recently..Ghana's major corporate miners have intensified their campaign for military protection at mining sites this year. Similar requests have been made in Burkina Faso and Mali, according to three mining executives and an industry analyst, who requested anonymity..""Ideally, we want military presence at all mining operations, but we understand the need to prioritize sites facing consistent attacks while implementing regular patrols at others,"" said Ahmed Dasana Nantogmah, chief operating officer of Ghana's Chamber of Mines..Industry leaders met government officials in mid-April to press their case, with discussions yielding ""positive"" results, said Nantogmah..Ghana's government did not respond to requests for comment..Ghanaian authorities want miners to cover deployment costs, estimated at 250,000 Ghana cedis ($18,116) per contingent daily of under 50 personnel, said two mining executives who were part of the negotiations..Ghana's mining sector regulator, the Minerals Commission, is taking a technological leap forward, establishing an AI-powered control room to analyze data from 28 drones deployed to illegal mining hotspots. The system includes trackers on the excavators and a control system that can remotely disable excavators operating outside authorized boundaries..""This is a fight we can win with technology if we allow full deployment,"" says Sylvester Akpah, consultant for Ghana's mining sector regulator's drone surveillance and AI-powered project."

Brent prices are down on the day too..While the escalating conflict surrounding Iran has turned unpredictable, it happens in a market where global space oil production capacity is running in excess of 4 million barrels a day - an oversupply expected to persist through the end of next year at least..What's more, outsize bets on the direction for oil linked to the outcome of the Iran war are frustrated by numerous binary outcomes - including both the survival of the Tehran government and even possible mining of theStraits of Hormuz. While the latter could stymie shipping in the region for a bit, it's not clear how long it could be enforced..With global demand set to ebb later this year, due in part due to the growth-dampening effects of U.S. trade tariffs, and U.S. production set to increase, speculative oil price punts are very risky..With oil prices still largely under wraps, the fallout for U.S. Treasuries is similarly limited..With one eye on Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell's semi-annual Congressional testimony on Tuesday and series of debt auctions during the week, 10-year yields remained stuck in recent ranges about 4.4%..Trump on Friday againfloated the idea of firing Powell..""I don't know why the Board doesn't override (Powell),"" Trump wrote in a lengthy post on Truth Social criticizing Fed policy.

The current global oil market certainly has spare capacity. OPEC+, an alliance of producing nations, today holds around 5.7 million barrels per day in excess capacity, of which Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hold 4.2 million bpd. Although there are concerns about closing of the key Straits of Hormuz waterway, the two Gulf powers could bypass it by oil pipelines. Saudi produces around 9 million bpd and has a crude pipeline that runs from the Abqaiq oilfield on the Gulf coast in the east to the Red Sea port city of Yanbu in the west.

I cannot wait for anything that lies ahead,"" Coventry said in her address to IOC members and other Olympic stakeholders..""I know I have the best team to support me and our movement over the next eight years."".Coventry will hold a two-day workshop this week to get feedback from members on key IOC issues..""Working together and consistently finding ways to strengthen and keep united our movement that will ensure that we wake up daily... to continue to inspire,"" she said..A seven-times Olympic medallist, Coventry won 200m backstroke gold at the 2004 Athens Games and in Beijing four years later..""With her election, you have also sent a powerful message to the world: the IOC continues to evolve,"" Bach said in his speech.
