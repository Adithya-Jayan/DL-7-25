2025-06-24,"Morning Bid: Oil, rates and the dollar tumble:.LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today.ByMike Dolan, opens new tab, Editor-At-Large, Financial Industry and Financial Markets.After a tentative ceasefire was announced in the Middle East,U.S. crude, gold, Treasury yields and the dollar gave up all gains registered since Israel's initial attack on Iran on June 13..Throughout this episode, energy market worries never amounted to a true 'shock' as movements of oil were largely unaffected. And given the large global supply overhang and slowing world demand, annual U.S. oil price gains never turned positive at any point over the past 12 days, failing even to set a new high for 2025..I'll discuss all of today's market news below and then move away from the headlines to explain how plunging immigration and the graying of America may be impactingthe Federal Reserve's view of the U.S. labor market..Today's Market Minute.* Oil tumbled 4%, global shares surged and the dollar dropped on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump saida ceasefire between Israel and Iran was in place..* However, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday he had ordered the military to strike Tehran after Iran fired missilesin violation of the ceasefire..* Crude oil's sharp reversal of the Israel-Iran war premium shows the power of a few words from a key player to move the market, butROI columnist Clyde Russell suggests the bigger issue here may be who played silent: Iran's allies..* Investors globally appear to be gradually reducing their exposure to dollar-denominated assets, driving the greenback down to its lowest level in years.ROI markets columnist Jamie McGeever explores where most of this selling is coming from..* Rapid growth in the installation of batteries is upending power systems across the United States.ROI columnist Gavin Maguire outlines the key battery system trends to track..Oil, rates and the dollar tumble.Iran's token responseto U.S. bombing of its nuclear facilities over the weekend was a well-telegraphed missile launch on U.S. bases in Qatar. That was quickly followed by U.S. President Donald Trump's acknowledgement of Tehran's intent to de-escalate and a call for a ceasefire thatIsrael said it wouldabide by..Whether that ceasefire will hold remains uncertain, with someexchanges between Iran and Israel reportedthis morning and thesituation still tense..But as it stands before Tuesday's U.S. open, crude is just $66 per barrel -$12 below Monday's peak- and just slightly up from a two-week low of $64.38 earlier in the session. In fact, Oil is now down almost 18% year-over-year..The S&P 500 rose 1% on Monday, and futures are up another 1% before Tuesday's bell. The VIX volatility gauge(.VIX), opens new tabis back to where it was on June 12, just above 18, with the gold price falling as well..The dollar skidded(.DXY), opens new tablower too, with the euro back within a whisker of 3-1/2-year highs and the yen recovering all of Monday losses. European and Asia shares surged more than 1% too..Wall Street now switches attention back home to the Federal Reserve, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell starting his two-day, semi-annual congressional testimony today just as some of his colleagues have stated turning remarkably dovish on the interest rate outlook..Trump clearly thinksthe Fed should move immediately to slash rates by ""two to three points"". The president has been lambasting Powell on an almost daily basis for not doing so..But Trump's appointees to the Fed board,Michelle BowmanandChristopher Waller,are now both advocates of easing sooner rather than later, opening up a big split between hawks and doves at the central bank. As many as seven policymakers last week indicated that they expected no rate cuts at all in 2025..ButBowman, who recently was one of the most hawkish members of the Fed's policy making council, electrified the rates market on Monday by saying it's time to consider easing as soon as next month..""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market,"" said Bowman, now Fed Vice Chair for Supervision..A parade of Fed speakers on Tuesday's slate could pour cold water on that view, but many market players think there is some jockeying for position going on at the central bank, with Trump expected to soon announce his pick to replace Powell when the Fed Chair's term expires next year..Even though Fed futures markets are still only pricing in a roughly 20% chance of a July cut, full year easing bets rose almost 10 basis points to near 60 bp after the Bowman comments and oil price retreat..Treasury yields responded quickly to the rate signals and energy relief, even with another heavy week of debt sales kicking off on Tuesday with $69 billion of 2-year notes up for grabs..Benchmark 10-year yields plunged below 4.3% for the first time in six weeks on Monday, though they've nudged back above that level again before today's bell..Elsewhere on Monday,Tesla shares(TSLA.O), opens new tabjumped over 9%after the electric-vehicle maker started testing its long-awaited robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk has touted as a driver of Tesla's lofty valuation..US migrant halt may wipe potential job growth.If you're wondering why so many U.S. Federal Reserve officials are remaining hawkish despite slowing growth, consider how the dramatic drop in immigration and the graying of America are impacting the unfolding labor market picture..Often overlooked by markets focused on the latest news about tariffs, geopolitics and energy markets,curtailing illegal immigration,a signature policy of President Donald Trump, is now starting to move the needle on the U.S. jobs outlook..The flow of migrant workers into the U.S. has effectively halted over the past year. The pace was already slowing sharply before the election but has ground to a near halt along with therise in deportationsthis year. Couple that with the steadily aging population of existing workers, and it looks like a labor crunch could be on the horizon..Economists at Barclays tracking these trends reckon that 'potential' non-farm private payrolls growth - or the level of extra jobs that can be created without leading to worker shortages - could fall to less than 10,000 per month by the end of next year from more than 100,000 today..They estimate that potential job growth will fall to about 60,000 within the next six months, slowing potential economic growth to only 1.4-1.6% year-on-year through next year from just over 2% now..These numbers are pretty stark when considering that average monthly private payrolls growth has been around 172,000 over the past two years..Meanwhile, Barclays says it expects the effects of population ageing to ""intensify very soon"", putting even more downward pressure on jobs growth..The combined impact of the two forces is ""about to create significant and persistent headwinds to potential growth in the labor force and economic activity,"" it said..The ingredients used to make the forecast are sobering..U.S. immigration surged over the past three years, adding a net 3-4 million to the U.S. population. The roughly 2 million new workers are four times the annual rate of the immediate pre-pandemic years. These were mostly asylum-seeking or 'humanitarian' cases given temporary authorization to live and work in the U.S..In fact, over the past two years, Barclays estimated that about three quarters of average monthly private jobs gains of almost 180,000 were filled by migrant workers..But since last summer, net inflows of humanitarian migrants have fallen to nearly zero. And, on top of that, the Barclays tracker estimated current deportations to be running at about 10,000 a month..On the flipside, U.S. census projections expect the population to decline by about 50,000 in 2026 and 100,000 in 2027. The aging of the population should also cause the labor force to shrink by about 360,000 this year and next, accelerating thereafter..Tweaking the underlying assumptions leads to different outcomes, of course, but Barclays' central conclusion is that potential payroll growth should essentially flatline in the coming years, weighing on potential GDP growth..Morgan Stanley also revised down net immigration estimates to a near halt this year and next, although it expects higher payroll 'breakevens' of 70,000 in 2025 and 2026..For the Fed, an unfolding economic slowdown, compounded by a demand hit from trade war uncertainties, may be arguments for easing policy now..Trump clearly thinksit should move immediately to slash rates, and his appointees to the Fed board,Michelle BowmanandChristopher Waller,are both now advocates of easing sooner rather than later..But if worker shortages are the problem, then that creates a very different problem for the Fed. In that scenario, the Fed's full employment mandate would not be at risk, but wage pressures could aggravate still above-target price inflation..With tariff hikes already fogging up the inflation horizon, it's therefore not surprising that seven Fed policymakers anticipate keeping the central bank's main borrowing rate steady through the rest of this year at least..A hit to the labor force then could cause growth to slow, even as the employment rate stays low and inflation pressures simmer..Fed inertia may be warranted if that transpires..Chart of the day.The oil market registered relatively few signs of alarm during a fortnight of intense aerial warfare between Israel and Iran that included this weekend's U.S. bombing of the latter's nuclear installations. In the context of the last 35 years of sharp oil price movements, this episode has been minor - so far at least..Today's events to watch.* U.S. Q1 current account (8:30 EDT), April house prices (9:00 EDT), June consumer confidence (10:00 EDT), Richmond Federal Reserve June business surveys (10:00 EDT).* Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers semi-annual monetary policy testimony before House Financial Services Committee (9:00 EDT).* New York Fed President John Williams, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, Boston Fed President Susan Collins, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Kansas City Fed boss Jeff Schmid all speak; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos and ECB chief economist Philip Lane speak; Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and BoE policymaker Megan Greene speak.* U.S. Treasury sells $69 billion 2-year notes.* U.S. corporate earnings: FedEx, Carnival.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Data for the fourth quarter was revised to show the gap at $312.0 billion instead of $303.9 billion as previously reported..Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit increasing to $443.3 billion last quarter..The deficit represented 6.0% of gross domestic product, the highest since the third quarter of 2006 when it peaked at 6.3%.

2025-06-24,"Exclusive: Central banks eye gold, euro and yuan as dollar dominance wanes:.LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The custodians of trillions of dollars of global central bank reserves are eyeing a move away from the greenback into gold, the euro and China's yuan as the splintering of world trade and geopolitical upheaval spark a rethink of financial flows..According to areport, opens new tabby the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) due to be published later on Tuesday, one in three central banks managing a combined $5 trillion plan to increase exposure to gold over the next one-to-two years after stripping out those planning to decrease, the highest in at least five years..The survey of 75 central banks -- carried out between March and May -- gives a first snapshot of the repercussions of U.S. President Donald Trump's April 2Liberation Day tariffsthat sparked market turmoil and a slide in the safe-haven dollar and U.S. Treasuries..Gold, which central banks have already been adding at arecord pace, was seen benefiting even further longer term, with a net 40% of central banks planning to increase gold holdings over the next decade..""After years of record-high central bank gold purchases, reserve managers are doubling down on the precious metal,"" OMFIF said..The dollar, the most popular currency in last year's survey, fell to seventh place this year, OMFIF said, with 70% of those surveyed saying the U.S. political environment was discouraging them from investing in the dollar -- more than twice the share a year ago..In currencies, the euro and yuan stand to benefit the most from a diversification away from the dollar..A net 16% of central banks surveyed by OMFIF said they plan to increase euro holdings over the next 12 to 24 months, making it the most in-demand currency, up from 7% a year ago, followed by the yuan..But over the next decade, the yuan is more favoured, with a net 30% of central banks expecting to increase holdings and its share of global reserves seen tripling to 6%..Separately, three sources who deal directly with reserve managers, told Reuters they saw the euro as now having the potential to recapture the share of currency reserves lost following the 2011 euro debt crisis by the end of this decade. They cited more positive sentiment among reserve managers towards the euro following Liberation Day..That would mean a recovery to a roughly 25% share of currency reserves, from around 20% currently, representing a key moment in the bloc's recovery from the debt crisis that threatened the euro's existence..Max Castelli, head of global sovereign markets strategy and advice at UBS Asset Management, told Reuters that reserve managers made many calls after Liberation Day to ask if the dollar's safe-haven status was at risk..""As far as I remember, this question has never been asked before, not even after the great financial crisis in 2008."".The average expectation for the dollar's share of global FX reserves in 2035 was 52%, the OMFIF survey showed, remaining the No.1 reserve currency but seen down from the current 58%..OMFIF survey respondents expected the euro to reach about a 22% share of global reserves in 10 years' time..""The euro's share of global reserves will almost surely rise over the next few years, not so much because Europe is viewed so much more favorably, but because the dollarâ€™s status is diminished,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist, told Reuters by e-mail ahead of OMFIF's publication..But Europe could attract a higher share of reserves sooner if the bloc is able to boost its pile of bonds that are currently dwarfed by the $29 trillion U.S. Treasury market, while integrating its capital markets, the sources that speak directly to reserve managers, told Reuters..ECB PresidentChristine Lagardehas also urged action to bolster the euro as a viable dollar alternative..The euro is the ""only real alternative currency for the moment to make a significant change in the level of reserves,"" said Bernard Altschuler, global head of central bank coverage at HSBC, adding he saw it as ""realistic"" for the euro to reach a 25% share of global reserves in 2-3 years if those issues are addressed..The European Union is the worldâ€™s largest trading bloc. Its economy is far bigger than the dollar's other rivals. Capital controls limit the appeal of the yuan..Momentum for change has gathered pace, with Europe signalling willingness to curb its dependence on the U.S. by boosting defence spending, including through more joint EU borrowing. Germany is ramping up spending, while the EU is trying to revive efforts to integrate its capital markets..Public pension and sovereign wealth funds, also surveyed by OMFIF, saw Germany as the most attractive developed market..UBS Asset Management's Castelli said he was receiving many more questions about the euro, estimating the euro could recover to a 25% share of reserves by the end of the 2020s..At the most bullish end, Francesco Papadia, who managed the ECBâ€™s market operations during the debt crisis, estimated the euro could recover to 25% in as soon as two years..Reserve managers he holds discussions with were more willing to look at the euro than before, Papadia, senior fellow at think-tank Bruegel, said..Zhou Xiaochuan, Chinaâ€™s central bank chief from 2002 to 2018, agreed the euroâ€™s role as a reserve currency could grow. However, there's ""homework to do,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent conference."

The Olympics will be for the children. It's children's sport,"" he said via a Zoom call..""It's like football and the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics..""The Olympic games are not developing the sport itself while the International Federation does..""The most important tournaments should be IBA tournaments including world championships as a pinnacle and Olympic tournaments should be in parallel just for the youth generation, for kids."".Speaking on the day former Zimbabwean swimmer Kirsty Coventrytook the helmof the IOC from Thomas Bach, Kremlev spoke of the German in derogatory terms and offered no conciliatory words to either..He said future IOC presidents should be elected by countries rather than individual IOC members and Coventry should ""leave no trace of Bach""..Kremlev has history in attacking the IOC and Bach, doing so at the Paris Games in a long and rambling press conference last August that drew a withering response from the Olympic organisation..""If you ever needed any evidence at all that the IBA is unfit to run boxing just look at the key members of the IBA who took part in that travesty,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at the time..Kremlev also repeated a call for Olympic athletes to be paidprize money..Kremlev heaped scorn onWorld Boxing, the body created in 2023 that now has more than 100 members and is set to organise the 2028 tournament after the last two were run by the IOC..""Nobody should compare this particular organization with the IBA because the IBA is a huge elephant and this organization is a fly, a small insect who doesn't live,"" said the Russian..The boxing competition at the Paris 2024 Games was run by the IOC after it stripped the IBA of recognition for failing to implement reforms on governance and finance..The IBA decided anyway to award prize money to boxers competing in Paris..Kremlev said more details about the IBA's future plans would come at a press conference in Istanbul on July 2..He also gave an update on legal action,threatened in February, against the IOC for allowing Algerian gold medallist Imane Khelif to compete in the women's tournament at the Paris Games in a gender-eligibility row..Kremlev said the IBA's legal team was still looking into the matter but would be taking it to civil courts and not the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)."
2025-06-24,"Central bank body BIS delivers stark stablecoin warning:.LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The Bank for International Settlements issued its starkest warning yet on the risks posed by stablecoins and urged countries to move rapidly towards the tokenisation of their currencies..The BIS, often dubbed the central bankersâ€™ central bank, outlined its concerns, including stablecoins' potential to undermine monetary sovereignty, transparency issues and the risk of capital flight from emerging economies..It comes less than a week after the U.S. Senatepassed a billto create a regulatory framework for U.S.-dollar-pegged stablecoins, a move which, if rubberstamped by the House, is expected to fuel a furtherexplosionin their popularity..Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, backed by real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries or gold..Dollar-pegged coins currently account for 99% of the market, which is estimated to have over $260 billion worth of coins in circulation..""Stablecoins as a form of sound money fall short, and without regulation pose a risk to financial stability and monetary sovereignty,"" BIS said in a early-released chapter of its annual report due to be published on Sunday..Hyun Song Shin, the BIS' Economic Adviser, explained that stablecoins lack the traditional settlement function provided by a central bank with fiat money..He likened them to private banknotes circulating in the 19th-century Free Banking era in the United States. It means they can often trade at varying exchange rates depending on the issuer, undermining the no-questions-asked principle of central bank-issued money..""Singleness is either you have it or you don't,"" Shin said, also warning of the risk of ""fire sales"" of the assets backing stablecoins if they collapse, as TerraUSD (UST) and the cryptocurrency LUNA did in 2022..There is also the concern around who controls stablecoins. Tether currently has more than half of the overall stablecoin market, but quit the EU following the introduction of new rules which require stablecoin operators to be licensed by the bloc..""The whole question of disclosure, this is where some of the stablecoins differ,"" BIS Deputy General Manager Andrea Maechler said. ""You will always have the question about the quality of the asset backing. Is the money really there? Where is it?"".The BIS wants central banks to go down the route of tokenised ""unified ledger"" incorporating central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits and government bonds..It would mean central bank money remains both the primary means of global payment and that currencies and bonds from around the world could effectively be integrated into the same ""programmable platform""..Tokenisation is aimed at creating a digitalised central bank system that settles payments and securities trades almost instantaneously and more cheaply by cutting the need for certain time consuming checks, as well opening up new functionality..It can also make the system more transparent, resilient and interoperable and may protect the system from some of the more unpredictable elements of cryptocurrencies..There would be a number of key issues to overcome, including who gets to set the rules governing the platform and that individual countries are likely to want to retain significant control of how and who uses their currencies..""Realising the full potential of the system requires bold action,"" the outgoing head of the BIS, Agustin Carstens, said."
