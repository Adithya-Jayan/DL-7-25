2025-06-11,"gold price $3500 vs. the investing crowd article:did gold investing prices leap too far already in 2025...? did gold $3500 mark a big top for the safe-haven metal back in april? asks adrian ash at bullionvault. history says maybe. investment professionals think so, too. ""according to bank of america's latest fund managers survey, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. ""this,"" explained yahoo! in april, ""marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the magnificent seven [of giant us tech stocks] as wall street's most crowded trade."" gold's over-crowding then got worse in may, or so the 208 institutional fund managers replying to boa's monthly survey said. a massive 58% of them labelled gold ""the most crowded trade""...! but really? sure, physical gold investing has picked up in 2025. march and april each brought bullionvault more first-time users than any month since new year 2021. most of them have chosen to buy gold first. but new account openings held a long way short of the genuine gold rush in 2020 or 2011, before easing back in may and june so far... ...and while lots of retail coin-and-bar shops will tell you (via the more gullible end of the mainstream media) that they are flooded with demand, the torrent of secondhand coins and bars sold back to them has continued to match if not drown it. secondly, yes.",0
2025-06-11,"some finance-industry products also saw demand rise. but only some, and only somewhat. gold-backed etf trust funds worldwide, for instance, needed the most bullion at the start of may since way back in september 2022. but that quantity rose only 15% from the 4-year low hit a year ago, and trust funds listed in europe grew less than 7%... ...before the global total then shrank for 3 weeks running this may. more telling still, speculative betting on us gold futures and options actually fell as the price raced up to april's new all-time highs. because the hot money of hedge funds, ctas and other 'managed money' traders has walked away from gold, not pushed in, so far in 2025. over the 21 weeks since new year's eve, the price of gold has risen by 28%. yet the size of the net spec long in comex gold futures and options has shrunk by more than a third, dropping below its 10-year, 5-year and 3-year averages and defying its previous but currently broken link with gold's price direction. so whatever ""crowd"" is buying and boosting gold, it doesn't work or trade in london, frankfurt, paris or new york. but that's hardly news. because time and again since gold turned decisively higher in late 2023, the data and the facts on the ground point instead to china's private gold-market flows, plus 'the rest vs. the west' among central banks and sovereign wealth. are those two trades crowded?",0
2025-06-11,"maybe. ""the largest traders in shfe gold have accumulated a new all-time-high position size,"" says commodity strategist daniel ghali at canadian brokerage td securities. but there's no relationship bullionvault can find between the size of speculative betting in shanghai futures and the direction of prices (contrasting with the way that us comex bulls tend to track if not drive the price). and besides, as ghali also notes, ""chinese gold etf flows remain muted"", snapping the sharp rise (albeit from a very low base) seen earlier this year. central banks, meantime, continue adding gold to their official reserves as a group overall... ...but at a slower pace as prices hit fresh record highs in april... ...led by the long-time gold loving nbp of poland, followed by the czechs, chinese and turkey. add in unofficial, unreported gold reserves demand however, and total central-bank purchases are set to top 1,000 for the 4th year running in 2025 on the forecast estimate from specialist analysts metals focus. that's a big number, the biggest since before world war 2 when first breached in 2022. but it's not accelerating, not in weight terms, on mf's analysis. so that crowd is now a longstanding (if cloaked) feature of the market. and anyway, are those the crowds which boa's fund managers are talking about anyway? the boa survey asks a daft question and gets a daft answer. what its respondents mean by ""crowded"" isn't defined.",0
2025-06-11,"nor is the market insight or intelligence which tells them what other investors are doing. sure, there are many more bulls who are now much more vocal than there were six or 12 months ago, let alone when gold was half today's price back in mid-2022. but simply scrolling through the headlines on your phone doesn't tell you anything about what other investors are really doing with their money (or their clients' savings). nor does it cut through the hype to show you whether salesmen and promoters are making it up or not. fact is, the very idea of trying to spot the ""most crowded trade"" is a psychological snake-pit writhing with bias, envy and fomo... ...and boa's question most likely reflects a) what an actual crowd doesn't currently own, and therefore b) which asset they want to believe has run too high, too fast, because they have missed out. and lo! fund managers who don't own gold also think it's over-valued, too. ""usually, when you ask a bunch of investors whether something is under- or overvalued, and a bunch of them agree, the thing to do is run the other way,"" writes columnist robert armstrong at the financial times, also reviewing may's boa survey. ""the interesting bit is that the last two times a lot of managers agreed that gold was overvalued, in 2020 and in 2011, they were right. ""look at how gold performed subsequently (dark blue line). after 2011's fall, it took a decade for gold to retake its high in nominal terms."" interesting, yes. but useful?",0
2025-06-11,"if the boa survey offers a guide to gold's future value, its 100% strike rate represents only 2-in-2 so far. that's nowhere near a pattern. more notably, the survey has also given two clear 'false positives' to date as well (early 2010, late 2024). so again, boa's survey most likely says ways more about the psychology of fund managers than it does about gold's record price run of either 2011, 2020 or 2025 to date. as for the gold market itself, it's far from empty. but crowded with bulls it ain't. ""nordnet fund savers bought global funds in may, dumped gold and silver,"" says a headline about the swedish share-trading platform. ""gold is out, equities are in,"" says a report from india quoting asset managers whiteoak. ""bitcoin etfs pull in $9 billion as investors ditch gold holdings,"" adds bloomberg, pointing to us trust-fund flows. bottom line? gold has jumped and lots of fund managers missed it. but that doesn't make it over-valued or crowded. and where the boa survey may have value as a contrarian guide, it's far more likely to shine a light on us equities and other rich-world stock markets rather than gold. cos that's what the fund management crowd buys and sells. glance at gold's price chart, meantime, and you can't miss the size and speed of this spring's surge. that might suggest $3500 marked an important, long-term high. because gold has a nasty habit of setting big ugly tops. more to come in part 2...",0
2025-06-03,"gold investing trends higher at fresh record prices article:underlying gold investment price tops new highs... gold investing sentiment continues to trend higher as the 'safe haven' precious metal sets fresh record prices, says adrian ash at world-leading marketplace bullionvault. gold in may swung as much as 10.8% below april's all-time high of $3500 per troy ounce. but its month-average price rose for the 5th month in a row, gaining 2.2% to set a new record at $3278 per troy ounce. like gold's underlying price, western gold investing sentiment also rose, with the gold investor index also rose adding 0.7 points to 55.5 in may. that trend gave the highest reading on bullionvault's unique measure of investors who chose to buy versus those choosing to sell since february's 28-month high of 56.3, and it pulled the gold investor index's 12-month average up to 54.0, the strongest underlying level since august 2023. back then, gold was trading at $1920 per ounce, almost two-fifths (41.4%) below last month's average price. by weight, investor profit-taking in gold was offset by demand in may. that contrasted with april's heavy net liquidation of gold, and it kept the combined holdings of bullionvault users as a group virtually unchanged at 43.7 tonnes, now worth $4.6 billion (£3.4bn, €4.0bn).",0
2025-06-03,"the number of new first-time investors eased back by one-third (37.4%) from april's 50-month high, but it held nearly two-thirds (62.8%) above may last year and it was more than one quarter greater (26.5%) than the past 5 years' monthly average, led by the uk (+32.7% from its 5-year monthly average), germany (+40.3%), spain (+66.5%) and ireland (+70.2%). the united states, however, continued to show relatively weak new investor interest in precious metals, with the number of first-time bullionvault users dropping 44.6% last month from april's 48-month high, down 13.9% versus may 2024 and 16.4% beneath the past 5 years' monthly average. but the balance of us-resident gold buyers versus sellers on bullionvault rose for a second month running, taking the us-only gold investor index up to 52.7, its highest in 2 years. so while us exceptionalism appears to extend to the need for portfolio insurance, sentiment towards the precious metal keeps trending higher, albeit from a lower base than among european investors. silver's month-average price rallied 1.4% in may, rising back to $32.70 after the more industrially-useful precious metal dropped 2.8% from march's 12.5-year high of $33.18 per troy ounce amid april's us tariff-policy chaos. in contrast to april's heavy net buying of silver, demand for silver was matched almost exactly by investor selling last month, keeping bullionvault clients' combined holdings just above 1,160 tonnes with a value of $1.2 billion (£916m, €1.1bn).",0
2025-06-03,"the silver investor index, however, sank to 51.8, down 6.5 points from april's sudden 49-month high. this sharp retreat confirms that bargain-hunting drove april's spike. but as with the gold investor index, sentiment keeps trending upwards, marking higher highs and higher lows as the industrially-useful precious metal's underlying price continues to rise. on a 12-month basis, silver prices rose in may above $31 per troy ounce for the first time since new year 2013. as for gold, its run of month-average gains has now made the strongest start to any year since 2006, matching the 5-month covid crisis run of april-to-august 2020 with the longest unbroken stretch of gains since the 8-month run ending in september 2011, the peak of gold's global financial crisis bullion market. so while the trump white house is promoting crypto, the uncertainty and volatility spurred by the president's policies provide the perfect backdrop for fresh gains in gold, making it the best-performing asset of 2025 so far. that extends gold's market-beating returns across the 21st century to date, confirming its appeal as a vital portfolio asset.",0
2025-05-29,"platinum price 'could hit $1200' amid 2025 supply deficit article:platinum week sentiment positive despite autocat decline... the price of platinum could have further to run from this month's sudden 2-year highs according to leading analysts. but while new mine supply will again fail to match the size of demand for the 3rd year running, platinum's market deficit will continue to be met by ample stockpiles of the industrial precious metal, capping its 2025 investment potential. ""the platinum market is expected to be in a deficit for a third consecutive year in 2025,"" says consultancy sfa (oxford) in analysis published by precious metals refiners heraeus. ""but this has not been reflected in the price...and plenty of stock remains available in 2025.""

2025-05-29,"that beat the platinum price spike made during last year's event. ""china was a very good physical buyer at the platinum price around $950,"" reuters quotes one precious metals trader, after new data said the world's no.1 manufacturing economy imported the most in a year last month, jumping by almost one-half from march's figure. ""the spike above $1000 will mute this demand."" last week also saw hedge funds and other speculators trading nymex platinum futures and options on the cme derivatives exchange turn bullish as a group for the first time since the start of april. data starting in 2006 says that the managed money category was never net negative on platinum prior to the dieselgate scandal which broke in september 2015, but those traders as a group have bet against the white precious metal 31.3% of the time since then. a court in braunschweig, germany this week sentenced two former executives at nearby automaker volkswagen to two and four years in prison respectively, and gave suspended sentences of more than a year to two other members of what the judge called a ""gang"" which cheated emission-testing systems. shares in vw (etr: vow3) are now trading back down at the sudden lows hit in the 60% crash of 2015, when the dieselgate scandal began hurting sales of diesel-engine passenger vehicles and hitting sentiment towards platinum, as did the surge in sales of battery electric vehicles.",0
2025-05-29,"the slew of new analyst forecasts published for platinum week all expect auto-sector demand for platinum and its sister palladium to decline once again in 2025. that's despite a slowdown in the sales growth of bevs, for which production is expected to rise by less than 1/5th this year according to the mining industry's world platinum investment council. uk-based autocat and pgm refining specialist johnson matthey last week agreed the sale of its catalyst technologies (ct) business to honeywell international for £1.8bn ($2.4bn). that news saw jm's share price (lon: jmat) leap 30.7% to hit a 12-month high. like jmat, the share price of belgian autocat and refining specialist umicore (ebr: umi) last month hit its lowest level since early 2009, down 87.6% from umi's record high of mid-2021. yet this month's platinum week found sentiment ""a lot more positive"" towards the precious metal's outlook, says adrian hammond, executive director precious metals, oil and gas at south african brokerage sbg securities.

2025-05-14,"gold volatility tops silver's the most since 9/11 article:$100 days make gold jumpier than stocks, too... another week, another slug of $100 days in the gold price, writes adrian ash at bullionvault. monday was $100 happier if you were buying... ...or $100 annoyed if you were selling... ...and with wednesday coming close again, bullionvault users keep doing plenty of both, just like they did last month. silver also saw heavy trading in april, and also because of big price swings. but while gold trading is still running strong, silver trading has eased back. and while historical data say that silver prices typically swing harder and faster than gold, that's not true right now. in fact, our analysis of the statistics shows that gold is now jumpier than silver by the widest margin since the 2001 terror attacks of 9/11. volatility is the way that analysts measure how jumpy an asset's price is, or isn't. high is bad, low is good. or so investment managers think. short-term traders like it the other way around. because quicker moves make for fast money, if you call it right. there's a number of ways to track volatility. our statistics use the standard deviation maths (just like most such analysis does), crunching the size of the price swings for gold and silver, day-to-day, across every 21-day period (ie, one month of weekday trading).",2
2025-05-14,"that number is then spat out as an annualized percentage... ...and the blue line in bullionvault's chart above simply tracks the difference between gold's rolling 1-month volatility and the rolling 1-month vol in silver. as you can see, gold is usually less volatile than silver. much less volatile. over the past 6 decades in fact, gold has shown 16.2% volatility on average. for silver, the data averages out at 28.8%. this is why silver, famously, is known as ""the devil's metal"". it's likely to jump or plunge far more often than gold... ...crushing any short-term traders who think they can guess which way it's going to swing next, most especially if they're betting with leverage through futures and options or cfds and spreads rather than spot-market cash prices. but who's the devil's metal now? because over the past month, the price of gold has swung more violently than silver. that's rare. since april 1968, when open-market gold prices were cut free from the dollar's official value of $35 per troy ounce, gold has been more volatile than silver less than 9% of the time. and over the past 2 decades, that statistic falls to just 1.1% of the time. indeed, up until late last week, the dollar-price data say that gold hadn't been more volatile than silver since mid-april 2022... ...immediate aftermath of russia starting its 'special operation' to invade ukraine. back then, gold out-freaked silver by just 1.7 percentage points.",2
2025-05-14,"whereas this monday, gold's 1-month volatility reached 12.0 percentage points above silver's if you track their london benchmark prices day-to-day. that means gold has been out-freaking the devil's metal by the widest margin since late-september 2001... ...immediate aftermath of al qaeda's 9/11 atrocities on new york and the pentagon. that terrible day coincided with gold prices finally finding their floor after a 2-decade bear market. (lots of other factors counted too, but it's how history already likes to remember it.) today, in contrast, gold has been soaring to fresh record highs, swinging lower only to set fresh record highs yet again, before swooning below $3200 this wednesday. so has the past month's dramatic gold price action marked a blow-off top for the 'safe haven' metal? maybe. but gold's sudden skittishness shouldn't spook investors out of the precious metal, not by itself. compare gold to the stock market, for instance. yes, gold is currently out-freaking the s&p500 index by a wide margin. day-to-day over the past month, its volatility is a hefty 14.3 percentage points higher. but over the past 5 years, gold has been less volatile than that major us stock index almost 2/3rds of the time... ...only out-pacing the stock market's volatility 37.3% of the time on our analysis of london 3pm vs. the new york close. silver, in contrast, has been more volatile than the s&p index nearly 9/10ths of the time (89.1% to be exact).",2
2025-05-14,"so while gold's sudden freak-out might give some newer investors the jitters, it's got a long way to go...plus a whole heap of history to overcome too...before it gets anywhere close to matching the volatility of the stock market, never mind silver prices.",2
2025-05-12,"which country owns the most gold? gold reserves by nation article:data and charts for today's top 10 largest gold buyers and holders... central bank gold buying is a vital factor in the global gold bullion market today. over the past 5 years, central banks as a group have chosen to buy almost 1 in every 8 ounces produced by global gold mining. their demand outweighed inflows to gold-backed etf investment products more than 5 times over. in fact, the total quantity of gold now reported to be held in national central-bank reserves – shown on bullionvault's interactive data table and map below – today accounts for 17% of all the gold ever mined in all of history. which countries lead this central-bank gold buying? here, bullionvault shares data and analysis revealing both today's largest gold reserves holders plus which nations have chosen to buy the most gold since the start of 2020. as we shall see, china, poland and india have topped the table for gold buying since the covid pandemic began 5 years ago, with russia close behind. but none of those counties top the table for outright gold reserves holders. not yet, and not on the official data at least. get the full picture of the world's largest central bank gold buyers and holders with these interactive map and tables. top 10 countries by gold reserves 2025 gold continues to be a cornerstone of financial security for many nations in the 21st century, especially in times of global uncertainty.",0
2025-05-12,"over the five years to 2025, central banks around the world have continued to bolster their bullion reserves as a hedge against inflation, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical instability. but which countries hold the most gold? explore all the gold reserves data in detail at the bottom of the page. usa official data for the start of 2025 says that the united states continues to lead the global gold rankings with a massive 8,133.5 tonnes of gold held in reserve. against its population of close to 340 million, this translates to an average of 23.9 grams of gold per person, worth almost $2200 per head at gold's early 2025 prices. despite no change in reserve volume over the past five years, that per capita figure underscores the scale of america’s longstanding investment in gold as a strategic asset. the consistent volume also reflects the federal reserve’s conservative approach to its gold policy. germany germany’s gold reserves amount to 3,351.6 tonnes, maintaining its position as europe’s top gold-holding nation. with a population of just over 83 million, this equates to an impressive 40.2 grams per person. this high per capita figure reflects germany’s deep-rooted trust in gold as a store of value, managed by the deutsche bundesbank. although the tonnage has dipped slightly from 2019, the country's commitment to gold remains firm. italy based on italy’s official data for the end of 2024, its gold holdings stand firm at 2,451.9 tonnes, unchanged from five years earlier.",0
2025-05-12,"with a population nearing 58.9 million, the country enjoys a strong 41.6 grams of gold per capita, one of the highest ratios in europe. this consistent reserve level demonstrates italy’s continued reliance on gold as a key component of its national financial security, overseen by the banca d’italia. france france holds a substantial 2,437.0 tonnes of gold, virtually unchanged from five years ago. with a national population approaching 64.8 million, this amounts to around 37.6 grams of gold per capita. managed by the banque de france, the country’s long-standing commitment to gold underscores its strategic role in safeguarding monetary stability, even as public interest in gold fluctuates. russia russia has, on its publicly stated data, boosted its gold holdings to 2,333.1 tonnes, reflecting a steady rise from its start-2020 level. with a population of approximately 144.4 million, this equates to 16.2 grams per capita. though not the highest on the list, russia’s strategic focus on increasing its reserves over time points to a broader effort to bolster economic independence and reduce exposure to foreign currencies. china china’s gold reserves grew significantly to 2,279.6 tonnes by the end of 2024, marking a continued upward trend in accumulation. however, with a vast population of over 1.42 billion, the country still only holds 1.6 grams of gold per person, one of the lowest per capita levels among major reserve holders.",0
2025-05-12,"this disparity highlights the impact of population size on per capita figures, even when total reserves are high. but it might also be contradicted by the widespread view among gold-market analysts that beijing is most likely growing its gold holdings faster than it reports in public, cutting its exposure to the dollar and other us assets in favor of bullion. switzerland switzerland remains a global outlier when it comes to per capita gold, with 1,039.9 tonnes of gold reserves shared among just 8.8 million people. this results in an impressive 118.2 grams per person, by far the highest gold-per-head ratio in the world. despite a referendum in 1999 voting to end the franc's formal gold-backing in law, the swiss national bank’s commitment to maintaining large reserves of bullion reflects switzerland’s historic role as a haven of financial security and independence. india india’s gold reserves rose significantly from 635.0 to 876.2 tonnes over the past half decade, a 38% increase in just five years. however, with a population of more than 1.43 billion, this results in just 0.6 grams of gold per person. while the per capita figure is small, the growth in reserves signals the indian authorities' recognition of gold’s role in supporting national economic resilience and diversifying financial assets. that appeal is already well-known by india's private households, the 2nd largest buyers of the precious metal behind china's household sector.",0
2025-05-12,"japan japan’s gold reserves increased to 846.0 tonnes by the end of 2024, up from 765.2 in 2019. with a population around 123.3 million, that gives the country a modest 6.9 grams of gold per capita. while not among the highest, this figure reflects japan’s cautious and balanced approach to reserves management, with gold playing a supporting role alongside foreign currencies and other assets. netherlands the netherlands maintained its gold holdings at 612.5 tonnes as of new year 2025, nudging the central bank of turkey out of the top 10 on bullionvault's analysis because, on its reported figures, ankara counts a large portion of turkey's commercial bank gold holdings among its sovereign reserves. with a population of about 17.6 million, the netherlands shows a healthy 34.8 grams of gold per capita, placing it among europe’s more robust gold-per-head nations. as with switzerland, the consistency of its reserves reflects a long-standing national strategy focused on fiscal conservatism and stability. who is buying the most gold among central banks and why? at the start of the 21st century, all of the top 10 central bank gold nations were 'legacy' holders, sitting on massive reserves built during or in the years following world war two. led then as now by the united states, eight of those year 2000 giants were in western europe, and the other was japan. whereas today, russia comes in 5th place, with china in 6th and india in 8th.",0
2025-05-12,"in fact, turkey would be in 10th position, ahead of the netherlands, if we counted commercial-bank gold holdings − needed to back their customers' gold investment accounts − as part of its sovereign-state reserves like the central bank in ankara does on its official data. what changed to drive this surge of non-western gold buying? first came the early 2000s' rush of globalization. it poured western consumers' cash into emerging-market nations' central-bank reserves, buying gas and crude oil from russia plus manufactured goods from china and india. it also coincided with ill-advised gold bullion sales by many western nations, made at what proved to be the eve of gold's dramatic 21st century gains to date. then, around 2010, the us and european financial crisis saw emerging-market central banks buy gold to spread their portfolio risk away from the dollar. that move has since continued, but with a sharp geopolitical edge, since russia was hit by western financial sanctions over its invasions of ukraine, first annexing the region of crimea in 2014 and then attempting to take the whole country since 2022. that has seen demand to buy gold for national central bank reserves spread among many smaller nations. because washington and brussels have, in the eyes of many, chosen to 'weaponize' their currencies as a tool of geopolitical control. gold, in contrast, is no one's to control through bank clearing systems or outright default.",0
2025-05-12,"so it shines as a way of diversifying exposure to the dollar, to the euro, and to the political actions of western governments. china the world's 7th largest economy in us dollar terms in 1999, china jumped to 3rd place on the gdp league table within 10 years and then overtook japan, closing the gap with world no.1 economy the usa to less than 50% by 2014 and then to barely 30% last year. driving that economic growth, china has built a giant manufacturing sector and earns a huge trade surplus against the rest of the world. today it ships out over 14% of all merchandise exports by value, but it buys less than 11% of global imports. to pay for the gap, other countries – led by the usa – must send huge quantities of currency to china to get the goods that they want. that has enabled the central bank in beijing to build massive reserves of foreign currency and bonds, led by the us dollar. china's fx reserves at the people's bank are so huge, its massive gold holdings still accounted for just 5.5% of the total in us dollar terms at new year 2025. but that ratio has more than doubled over the past 20 years as beijing more than tripled the weight of its gold bullion reserves to reach more than 2,270 tonnes on the official data. that makes china the 6th largest national gold holder, with analysts believing that the vast bulk if not all of its gold is stored domestically. but do those figures understate china's true bullion reserves?",0
2025-05-12,"many analysts believe china's national gold bullion holdings are larger than the reported total, perhaps twice the size if you compare the country's visible private-sector demand against its gold mining output and bullion imports. the excess supply must have gone somewhere, and the people's bank has in the past kept the changes in its gold holdings a secret, suddenly announcing huge increases in its gold reserves. india for a country with such a deep and famous love for gold, india began the 21st century very shy about buying any gold for its central-bank reserves. but looking to diversify its foreign-exchange reserves as economic growth in the world's most populous nation accelerated, the reserve bank of india in late 2009 bought a massive 200 tonnes of gold from the international monetary fund. india's 2009 gold purchase was the largest increase in its national gold holdings on record. it cost the central bank $1045 per troy ounce, then the highest gold price ever. the very same level then became the final floor for the gold prices when the market slumped in 2012-2015. perhaps that proves – as several analysts had noted – that the staff at india's central bank really do know a thing or two about gold. after the 2009 purchase of imf gold, the rbi kept its record-large gold reserves unchanged for 8 years, focusing instead on trying to boost the rupee's exchange-rate value while building its holdings of us dollars and other foreign currencies.",0
2025-05-12,"indeed, there was discussion about selling or lending some of india's gold to help the central bank defend the rupee, something it had done two decades earlier. but the officials in mumbai then began to buy gold regularly from the end of 2017, adding almost 320 tonnes since then to take the reserve bank of india's total reported bullion reserves to the 8th largest worldwide among national central banks. over 27% of the total has been added in the past 5 years alone, as our table shows. what's more, india has recently joined another key central-bank gold trend – repatriating some of its gold reserves from abroad, and keeping more of its bullion at home. more on this geopolitical trend and the reasons behind it below. poland trailing the monster gold buyers of china, india and russia, three members of the european union have also shown strong appetite for central-bank gold reserves over the past five years, led by poland. while some of warsaw's gold buying appeared politically motivated under the right-wing law and justice party (pis), poland's gold purchases have continued since they lost power in 2023, adding another 89.5 tonnes last year alone. hungary and the czech republic have meanwhile more than doubled their gold reserves since the start of 2020, eve of the global covid pandemic. like poland, they are due to join the single euro currency at some stage. but for now, they continue choosing the safety of gold bullion as a key monetary reserve.",0
2025-05-12,"countries doubling their gold reserves other countries doubling the weight of their gold reserves since the end of 2019 include georgia and kyrgyzstan in eastern europe, major african gold-mining nation ghana, eu and euro member ireland (albeit to only 12.0 tonnes), plus middle east states the united arab emirates and qatar. russia as with china, the central bank of russia is believed to keep all its gold bullion domestically, rather than holding much if any abroad. also like china, there's debate over the true size of russia's government gold holdings. but on the central bank's official data, moscow now holds the world's 5th largest national gold hoard after choosing to buy almost 2,000 tonnes for its reserves over the last 20 years. that gold-buying spree took off as the price of oil and gas – which make up half of russia's total exports and account for almost 1/5th of its entire economic output – began rising in the 'commodity supercycle' of the early 2000s. boosting russia's gdp as well as moscow's tax revenues, the country's trade surplus with the rest of the world also spurred a jump in the central bank's reserves of foreign currency, most of all the us dollar. at the same time, vladmir putin – then as now president of russia – called for the central bank of russia (cbr) to increase gold's share in its foreign-exchange reserves, and he also called for greater investment into russia's gold-mining industry.",0
2025-05-12,"the country has since moved from 5th position to no.2 among the largest producer nations, almost doubling its annual gold mine output by weight. as a major supplier to the global bullion market, russia's gold miners hit a big problem when western sanctions hit the country's banking sector after its invasion and annexation of ukraine's crimea region in 2014. those us and eu sanctions meant russia's gold miners couldn't easily access the international market to sell their output. so after reporting no sales and only purchases between 2007 and 2012, the central bank of russia accelerated its relentless campaign of gold buying in 2014-2018, paying domestic mining companies with rubles to buy 80% of their output. russia's huge gold accumulation means that it accounted for more than one-third of all national central-bank gold buying worldwide since 2004. but moscow's dominance has slipped, sinking below 4% of the sector's net demand over the last 5 years while china accounted for 20% and india 14%, with poland and turkey both on 13%. first, that's because other countries began buying gold during the western financial crisis of the late 2000s. russia's accumulation then slowed because of the 2020 covid crisis, when the plunging price of crude oil hit moscow's tax revenues and forced the ruble's foreign exchange rate lower.",0
2025-05-12,"thirdly, moscow's war on ukraine then hit the russian state's finances and international liquidity reserves as the us, uk and eu authorities have tried to lock it out of the global financial system. the cbr initially said it wouldn't buy any domestic gold output, but it relented as western sanctions hit both russia's mining industry and its own ability to grow its reserves of non-ruble assets. why do central banks buy and hold so much gold? ""gold,"" says a research paper co-written by monetary historian barry eichengreen in 2023 and published by the imf, ""appeals to central-bank reserve managers as a safe haven in periods of economic, financial and geopolitical volatility."" because those stresses have worsened so far in the 21st century, gold's appeal has only grown for many central-bank buyers, as you can see on this interactive table (click the column headings to sort the table). overall, the total quantity of gold held in national central-bank reserves has increased almost 19% by weight over the past 20 years – and it has jumped 7-fold in us dollar value to $2.5 trillion – led by russia, china, india, turkey and uzbekistan. how much gold does the uk have? the uk held 310.3 tonnes of gold at the end of 2024, unchanged from 2 decades before, when it ended a heavy gold-selling program which coincided with the bottom of the precious metal's long bear market.",0
2025-05-12,"with a population of approximately 67.7 million, this works out to just 4.6 grams of gold per person, a relatively low figure when measured against other leading western nations. despite the modest reserve size, the uk's gold is securely managed by the bank of england and plays a supporting role in the country’s foreign reserves portfolio. why are uk gold reserves low? the united kingdom’s low gold reserves can largely be traced back to that controversial decision made between 1999 and 2002 when the uk government sold more than half of its gold holdings at historically low prices. instead of accumulating gold, the uk has focused its reserve strategy on a diversified basket of foreign currencies and other financial assets, viewing gold more as a hedge than a primary store of value. uses of gold faqs what is gold used for in jewelry? gold has been used in jewelry for thousands of years primarily due to its appearance and natural lustre that doesn’t diminish over time due to gold’s inertness and resistance to tarnishing. pure gold is relatively soft and easy to craft into delicate and intricate pieces and can also be combined or alloyed with different metals to change its colour and hardness. what is investment grade gold? the global wholesale gold investment market, centred in london deals in the london good delivery gold bullion bar. this london good delivery bar weighs 400 troy ounces - about 12.4 kilograms - and is about eleven inches long.",0

2025-05-12,"when tariffs do good article:today's us underinvests and overconsumes... with so much attention focused on us stock markets, it seems timely to pivot away from stocks for the moment and consider the global perspective, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. globalization may be dying in terms of trade and supply chains, but financial markets are inextricably linked in ways that relatively few understand. the dollar still dominates the global financial system despite the cracks in the foundation and the valid criticisms. if there's a dollar problem in eurodollar banks, it's sure to echo from tokyo to shanghai and new york. and problems in those locales affect everything else. i continually urge people to get away from their desks, stop staring at screens and go out and talk to real people. there's no substitute for walking the streets around the world (including the poorest areas) if you really want to know what's going on. i've just returned from separate visits to india, japan and jekyll island, georgia. india has the largest population in the world, has the fifth largest economy, is a nuclear power and a key member of brics. japan is the fourth largest economy in the world and is a key geopolitical ally of the united states in its faceoff with china. jekyll island is a lovely ocean resort but is best known as the site of a secret meeting in 1910 where the morgan, rockefeller and warburg interests dreamed up the federal reserve system.",2
2025-05-12,"while india, japan and jekyll island could hardly be more diverse and geographically scattered, they share a common thread. it's their economic linkage through the us dollar. the following are some impressions i gathered during these visits that reflect the volatile situation facing markets today. for trump's new tariff policies, responses varied from retaliation tariffs (proposed by canada, china and the eu) to a much more reasonable approach of simply asking the white house for a meeting to sit down and discuss the issue amicably with a view to lowering tariffs in both directions. japan and india fell into this latter category and are being rewarded by being included among the first countries that will actually have that opportunity. (mexico has also taken the moderate route by engaging in discussions rather than retaliation). there will be some give and take. some us tariffs on certain items are likely to remain in place. but the optimal solution is not to cut down on us purchases from those countries but for them to buy more from the us. that trims the us trade deficit without reducing world trade and so constitutes a win-win resolution with both india and japan. india will likely buy more military hardware and semiconductors from the us japan will likely buy more agricultural goods including soybeans and beef. the result will be higher growth in the us. bilateral deals like this have losers.",2
2025-05-12,"taiwan may miss out on some semiconductor sales (although they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to build semiconductors in the us). russia may miss out on military sales to india although they will remain a major energy supplier. still, the us is done being the ""consumer of last resort"" to the world and wants to increase its profile as a seller. trump's policies move the us in that direction. there is little question that the new us tariff policy will hurt some countries around the world. not to sound harsh, but that's their problem. trump's job is to make america great again. president xi's job is to make china great again. chancellor-in-waiting merz's job is to make germany great again. the us cannot carry the world on its back. if other countries (rich or poor) took trump's growth-oriented approach instead of free riding on america, the entire world would be better off. that's certainly the view from the white house and is a good guide to us policy going forward. defenders of china point to the fact that chinese exports are not a particularly large percentage of their total gdp. (germany is the worst offender by that metric). the problem with that data point does not come from the chinese export number; i'm sure that's roughly correct. the distortion comes from the gdp denominator. chinese gdp is overstated by 100% (at least) perhaps more, and china may already be in a recession.",2
2025-05-12,"the reason is that china shows about 45% of its gdp as investment, mostly in the form of government backed construction. i've been to the ghost cities in china and seen more on the horizon. i got mud on my boots on the construction sites (except i was wearing italian loafers). there is real steel, glass and copper in the buildings and it takes real labor to build them. that all counts as gdp. but they're all empty. if you used gaap or international accounting principles, you would write that investment down to zero immediately. you can't put a ghost city into inventory. buildings age rapidly and take enormous amounts to maintain. i saw this in the congo in the early 1980s. they had a commodity boom in the 1970s and wasted much of the money on skyscrapers and other showcase projects. by the time i arrived there, the windows were falling out and rust stains ran down the sides of their showcases. the same thing will happen in china. once you make that accounting adjustment for wasted investment, gdp shrinks, and the chinese export/gdp ratio goes up exponentially. china is much more dependent on exports for any real growth than most analysts realize. trump and scott bessent have this right. tariffs are not automatically good or bad for an economy. their impact depends on initial conditions when the tariffs are imposed. tariffs are a tool that should be applied judiciously. a country that overinvests and under consumes will be hurt by tariffs.",2
2025-05-12,"the tariffs will increase investment and restrain consumption, making the imbalance worse. that's what happened to the us under the smoot-hawley tariffs in 1930 and later. a country that over consumes and underinvests will benefit from tariffs. that's the situation in the us today. the tariffs will increase investment as foreign and domestic investors build new plants behind tariff walls. tariffs will channel consumer dollars from consumption into savings, which is also desirable. in the end, consumption will expand not because of cheap imports but because of high-paying us jobs. china is in the category that overinvests (much of it wasted) and under consumes. china's best strategy would be to lower its own tariffs and allow its people to spend their savings on imported goods from the us and eu along with their own production. that would reduce china's trade surplus with the us, increase china's gdp and improve the well-being of its own people. it would also make an excellent opening move in any effort to get the us to reduce its tariffs on china. the us is making good use of tariffs. china is doing the opposite. china may be fighting to a draw in the rhetorical war, but it will definitely lose the trade war. japan, india and mexico are models of how to make progress. china is the poster child for how to fail. global supply chains will no doubt be disrupted by the tariff and trade wars now erupting. reconfiguring supply chains will be a one-to-two-year transition.",2
2025-05-12,"but once it's done, the new supply chains will prove durable. volkswagen blundered badly by putting its new audi q5 plant in mexico. their us sales are booming right now (beat the tariffs!) but will fall off a cliff once dealer inventories are drained and tariffs apply. still, that's a management blunder not a global disruption. supply chains are adaptable with a lag. us soybeans will soon be on their way to japan if china doesn't want them. as an aside, elon musk's shelf life in the white house pantry will soon expire. musk sparked a pointless feud with white house trade and manufacturing czar peter navarro. i know peter fairly well (a conversation with him is like a graduate level oral exam but that's another matter). when elon attacked navarro, he messed with the wrong guy. navarro took a bullet for trump by serving four months in a federal penitentiary rather than answer a subpoena that sought to pierce the veil of executive privilege between the two. that's the kind of loyalty trump respects. navarro also happens to be right about tariffs despite musk's whining. with regard to the federal reserve system that emerged from the swamps around jekyll island, the fed has fallen into complete irrelevance. they have modest impact on the short-end of the yield curve (treasury bills) but have no material impact on the intermediate- and long-end of the yield curve (treasury notes and bonds). us national debt and spending will never be brought under control.",2
2025-05-12,"but sustainable growth can be stimulated by sound fiscal policies, if not by the fed. as long as nominal growth is greater than nominal debt increases, then the us debt-to-gdp ratio will shrink. that's the simple formula behind scott bessent's three arrows plan and it can feed on itself in a virtuous circle. what the fed and the treasury have done (mostly under biden) is to create a global dollar shortage, which is now morphing into a global liquidity crisis. china is not dumping treasuries because they're distancing themselves from the dollar. quite the opposite. china is selling treasuries because they're desperate for dollars and can't get them from japanese banks who have their own problems with carry trade unwinds. the liquidity crisis then goes back to european banks who can't fund in eurodollars and us hedge funds who can't find collateral to support their derivatives basis trades. india is not immune. the best description of a financial crisis i've ever heard is that ""everybody wants his money back."" we're dangerously close to that situation right now. if it gets worse, trade, tariffs and stock markets will be a sideshow. watch treasury yields and foreign exchange markets if you really want to know what's going on.",2
2025-05-09,"silver investing leaps fastest since covid article:silver buyers +108% on price plunge... silver investing demand just leapt at its fastest pace since the covid crisis, writes adrian ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace bullionvault. the surge in demand came as the price of silver − which finds more than half its end-use globally from industrial and tech applications, over five times the proportion for 'useless' safe haven gold − fell hard from new multi-year highs, only to rebound as us president trump back-tracked on some of his 'liberation day' trade tariffs. across the first week of may, investors who had used bullionvault's live 24/7 marketplace to buy securely-stored silver at early april's sudden 6-month lows would have been offered net gains of 15.9% (11.6% for uk pound investors, 11.8% in euro terms). those gains would have been impossible for anyone buying bullion, small bars or coins outside professional storage because of those 'retail' units carrying dealing spreads as wide as 10% plus vat sales tax as high as 20% in the uk and europe. what drove april's surge in demand to invest in silver? while gold prices had stolen the headlines with a run of new records in 2025, silver quietly rose to its highest dollar prices since the global financial crisis, plus fresh monthly silver price records in euro and sterling terms across february and march.",0
2025-05-09,"but us president trump's shock 'liberation day' trade tariffs then sent silver prices reeling, spiking down like no time since the initial covid crash in world stock markets and commodities prices of march 2020. with silver prices spiking lower, the number of investors who chose to buy silver across april more than doubled from march. it jumped 108.0% on bullionvault's low-cost platform to the most since march 2021. the number of silver sellers meanwhile slipped 11.2% to the fewest since december last year. together that sent the silver investor index − bullionvault's unique measure of sentiment, calculated back to new year 2012 − soaring by 7.5 points to 58.3. that marks the highest reading in 49 months, thanks to the steepest month-on-month jump in the silver investor index since march 2020's series-record rise of 20.4 points. any reading above 50.0 means that buyers outnumbered sellers across the month. the silver investor index set a series peak at 75.1 as the covid crisis first struck in march 2020, and it set a series low of 45.0 on march last year's record-heavy profit-taking. what next? april's surge of silver investment demand hasn't yet run into may. that's because it came thanks to silver prices spiking lower, just as happened in spring 2020.",0
2025-05-09,"and longer-term, this spike in silver demand also followed nearly 2.5 years of net selling when prices rose and investors took profit, with sellers outnumbering buyers ten times on the silver investor index across the previous 29 months. silver investment by weight also leapt last month, totaling 17.8 tonnes net of customer selling. that was the heaviest 1-month buying since february 2021's net demand of 25.3 tonnes − an inflow driven by the #silversqueeze ramp on social media. this april's big silver inflow took bullionvault clients' total holdings − all securely stored and insured in each user's choice of london, singapore, toronto or (like gold, most popular) zurich − up to a 7-month high above 1,160.5 tonnes. that contrasts with gold, where half-a-tonne of net selling last month shrank bullionvault clients' total holdings to the lowest quantity in almost 5 years, just beneath 43.8 tonnes, on the heaviest net liquidation since march 2024's record 1-tonne of gold profit-taking. but by value, gold holdings set a fresh all-time high once again, rising to $4.6 billion (£3.4bn, €4.0bn). the drop in silver prices, in contrast, meant that the surge of investor demand still put client holdings 3.9% below march's record high in us dollar terms, down at $1.2 billion (-6.9% in gbp to £900 million, -8.5% in eur to €1.0bn). looking ahead, and whether or not the us-china trade war is resolved quickly, trump's tariffs shock is likely to weigh on global trade and economic growth.",0
2025-05-09,"the president's policies against green energy also present a headwind to silver, because the solar-energy sector worldwide has accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in total industrial demand to new record highs over the past decade. so while it's driven long term by the same inflationary and geopolitical tensions as gold, the price of the gray metal is more vulnerable to economic anxiety, as well as enjoying long-term demand growth, because of silver's strong industrial uses. that made silver 40% more volatile day-to-day last month than the safe haven metal, offering larger gains to short-term traders but also carrying more risk.",0
2025-05-06,"new gold investing jumps 121% but price trumps trump article:gold profit-taking heaviest since last march's record... gold's latest run of fresh record prices met the most new investors in over four years in april. but it also spurred the heaviest profit-taking, net of demand, in more than 12 months on bullionvault, writes adrian ash at the world-leading marketplace. now caring for a record $4.6 billion of securely-stored gold (£3.4bn, €4.0bn) for its global clientbase − nine-in-10 of whom live in western europe or north america − bullionvault saw the number of investors choosing to buy gold for the first jump 56.0% last month from march's figure, and it rose 121.6% from april last year to reach the most since february 2021. but the volume of gold selling leapt again, leading to the 5th heaviest net monthly outflow by weight since bullionvault's live 24/7 marketplace opened 20 years ago. so while trump's chaotic return to the white house has spurred a new wave of investors buying gold for the first time, the record gold prices which his policies have prompted are meeting heavy profit-taking from existing owners. that includes investors who first chose to buy gold earlier this year, seizing a quick profit as the surge in prices trumps longer-term fears over the impact of trump's policies. indeed, 2025's new gold buyers were 70.0% more likely to sell in april than investors who began buying gold during the previous five years. and why not?",0
2025-05-06,"anyone choosing to buy gold on bullionvault in january, february or march was, on average, offered a gain in us dollar terms of 10.7% last month net of all costs (6.2% in uk pounds, 4.0% in euros). across bullionvault's total client base in april, the number of people starting or adding to their gold holdings rose 26.5% from march's figure to the most since february 2021, depths of that winter's covid wave and lockdowns. the number of sellers meanwhile rose by 51.1% to the most since march last year's record high, when a surge in chinese demand and trading drove global gold prices sharply higher. together that put the gold investor index − our unique measure of sentiment based solely on actual trading behaviour on the world's largest marketplace for personal gold investment − at 54.8 in april. higher by 0.2 points from march and 3.2 points above april last year, that reading was 1.2 above the index's prior 12 months' average. any figure above 50.0 means that buyers outnumbered sellers on bullionvault. the gold investor index set a decade peak of 65.9 as the covid crisis struck in march 2020, and it set a series low of 47.5 on march last year's heavy profit-taking. but while the count of investors choosing to buy gold this april outnumbered those who chose to sell for the 13th month in a row, the quantity of selling outweighed demand by almost half-a-tonne (452 kilograms), the widest margin since march 2024's record 1-tonne outflow (992kg).",0
2025-05-06,"that reversed more than five times the net inflow made in january-to-march (86kg) − the first quarterly inflow since q2 2023 − with bullionvault users taking profit on more $46 million of gold (£35m, €41m). so with gold's new all-time highs destroying jewelry demand worldwide as western investment remains muted net-net, this bull market is being driven by china's latest gold investing surge, plus the ongoing bid from central banks wanting to cut their exposure to us assets, most especially the dollar. a new wave of private investment in europe suggests similar anxiety, and april's surge in first-time investors was led by the uk, spain and germany, where april's inflow of new users rose 121.8%, 147.5% and 66.9% respectively above their prior 5-year monthly averages. but while the number of new us buyers was, comparatively, quiet once more in april, it did rise 45.9% month-on-month and finally joined all western european nations in topping its previous 5-year monthly average (+39.8%). that's something not seen in four years outside of april 2023's 'mini banking crisis' and russia's invasion of ukraine in march 2022. meantime, the president's back-tracking on tariffs (and on firing us fed chairman jerome powell) have seen some of the heat coming out of the gold price. but the damage done to the dollar and to america's long-term investment appeal only adds to the appeal of gold as an all-weather hedge against geopolitical and financial volatility.",0

2025-05-03,"on 20 january, when donald trump took his oath of office, the gold price was $2725 per ounce. now, after 100 days it's about $3325, an upward move of 22%. correlation is not causation, as i learned many years ago in statistics class, but trump still owns some of that move. let's time-travel a decade ago to mid-2015 when the new york businessman dove into national politics and announced his run for the presidency. back then, the price of gold was just shy of $1200 per ounce. and over the past 10 years gold has moved up by about 177%. of course, trump alone doesn't move the price of gold. sure, he was president for four years, 2017-21. then, he was not president for four years; and in fact, from 2021-25 he spent much of his time as a professional defendant in multiple court cases. now he's back in the oval office at the three-plus month marker. but c'mon, man...all sorts of things move gold prices. in this regard, it's more accurate to say that the price of gold reflects global-scale perceptions of the inherent (and declining) value and utility of us dollars; and yes, trump definitely sways perceptions. that is, if world markets perceive that the us economy is strong and things look good for the future of america, then gold prices tend to moderate; they find a range. but if markets sense weakness in the us or its economic future, then the price of gold rises. again, trump plays a big role in all of this, but he's only one factor among many.",2
2025-05-03,"to help understand the moves in gold prices, let's do a quick (i promise) history lesson. we'll start in 1914, with a standard $20 coin called a ""st. gaudens"", named after the designer. this coin had a bit less than one ounce of gold in it (30.093 grams to be exact), along with a small measure of copper to harden the alloy. when it was minted 111 years ago, this item was worth a face value of $20, and the gold was also worth $20. in other words, and to channel the ghost of long-deceased tycoon j.p.morgan, ""gold was money"" back then, and twenty dollars bought an ounce of gold. if you're wondering why i chose 1914, it's because that was the first year of the us federal reserve, meaning america's central bank. president wilson signed the federal reserve act on 23 december 1913, literally in the dead of night, during a holiday period in a nearly empty washington d.c., which tells you much about how the fed came into being. then as 1914 unfolded, and in one of the fed's first official acts, it issued so-called ""notes"" among which some were valued at $20. the note specifically stated: ""the united states of america will pay to the bearer on demand twenty dollars."" meaning yes, you could take this to a bank and exchange the paper for a gold coin. today, you might be forgiven to think that the note itself is itself $20. but no, that's not the case; that 111-year-old item is definitely not $20, it's just a promise.",2
2025-05-03,"again, that's because long ago, ""twenty dollars"" meant an ounce of gold, ideally stamped into the shape of a coin. to nail the point, in 1914 gold was real money; paper notes were just promises, even those issued by the fed. that's even if, as in the case above, the us government was the promisor who guaranteed payment in gold. which brings us back to last month's gold price rise, up above the $3500 line, and then the subsequent pullback to the current level around $3325. do the math. at $3325, you now need over 166 federal reserve $20 bills – like those that you get from the local atm machine – to buy an ounce of gold; and that's just the gold, not allowing for any numismatic value to an old, rare coin. look at it this way; over the past 111 years, the dollar has shrunk in purchasing power and its ability to preserve wealth by a factor of 166. or stated in another way, a penny from that 1914 era is now worth $1.66. the value-loss of the past century had nearly nothing to do with president trump. indeed, for that decline in the dollar's value we can thank many presidents: wilson, harding, coolidge, hoover, roosevelt (franklin), truman, eisenhower, kennedy, johnson, nixon, ford, carter, reagan, bush (h.w.), clinton, bush (w.), obama, trump (first term), biden...and now trump 2.0 at his 100 day mark. generation after generation, president after president, the us government routinely engaged in deficit spending.",2
2025-05-03,"this is certainly the case since 1971, after president nixon essentially tore up the world war ii-era bretton woods agreement which kept the dollar tied to the value of gold. since then, federal spending, deficits and the national debt have mushroomed. now the nation owes unpayable levels of national debt, around $37 trillion. that, plus something approaching $2 trillion in interest due every year, a sum which cleans out most of the cash in the treasury's accounts. and it's axiomatic that the annual federal deficit is paid with borrowed funds, including what gets paid as interest on past debt. all in all, our national accounting scheme is a highway to ruin. to compound the matter, current american culture doesn't seem to know what to do with itself absent massive federal spending, particularly deficit spending which is sewn into the social fabric of the country. for many decades, congress has been institutionally incapable of cutting the budget. politically, there are few accounting priorities in washington; they fund just about everything. and we almost never program terminations except for a few of the most grievous military procurement boondoggles. more recently – the past 100 days – we've witnessed the nation's collective inability to deal with spending cuts. consider the apoplectic, psychotic reactions in many quarters to federal spending freezes and shutdowns. or to state it another way, we hear the sound of rice bowls being broken.",2
2025-05-03,"for example, we have trump's department of government efficiency (doge), which in just three months has torn through one federal agency after another. doge cut budgets, laid off staff, closed offices and more. and predictably, the mainstream media went nuts while people across the republic went to court, seeking a friendly federal judge to issue an order blocking the president from not spending money that, at root, the country doesn't have. did trump cut too many things, too much, too fast? hey, argue it any way you want because it depends on what's in your rice bowl. does america need most of what, say, us agency for international development (usaid) was doing? does the country need the department of education? and so on; there's a long list and no need to detail it here. then again, at an even higher plane, can trump ever begin to ""cut"" enough spending to save the financially foundering ship of state? so far, trump has eliminated perhaps $200 billion in federal expenditures, but the number ought to be ten times that size. good luck, right? the problem is that for better or worse, every federal dollar is someone's income. so when federal spending declines, it's money no longer in someone else's pocket. it's no wonder that house sales are down, airlines are selling fewer tickets, hotels are booking fewer rooms, auto dealers are selling fewer cars, and so on. whether trump is president or not, the fact is that the country is painted into a fiscal and monetary corner.",2
2025-05-03,"there's too much debt and interest, and not enough cash to pay for it absent inflating the currency. sure, captain trump has rearranged some deck chairs on the titanic, but the ship is still sinking based on a century of federal policy and misallocation of the country's resources. face it, there's no nice, clean, easy, pretty way to fix what's broken. now, here's one final point, which is that gold is slowly remonetizing. the world is moving towards a revised gold standard, and away from american petrodollars of the past half century. yes, it's happening under trump but this trend was happening in any event, trump or not. start with the gold price over the past 5 years. on the chart, you'll notice the upward trend in gold prices that began in mid-2022 during the biden administration; in fact, it occurred not long after the us government seized and froze massive amounts of russian sovereign wealth, at the time locked up in treasury bonds. that is, the us weaponized its currency, its banking system, and even its underlying basis of government finance. in response, the world reacted as one might imagine; central banks bought gold, the price of which has moved from $1750 to the recent $3500 level, a double in under three years. and don't be misled, it was central banks that bought large blocks of metal. gold's big move was not due to retail buyers down at the coin shops, nor hedge funds, banks, family offices, etc.",2
2025-05-03,"for three years, central banks unloaded dollars and derisked their long-term holdings. this reflects their collectively negative future perceptions of the us, its economy and strength. frankly, it doesn't matter that trump is now president. central banks were buying gold in 2022 when trump was battling state and federal prosecutors who wanted to toss him into jail. that is, trump had nothing to do with what kicked off the 2022 upward move in gold prices, a rising tide on which we're now floating. yes, trump's recent on-again, off-again tariff policies have created confusion. his budget and spending priorities are still in formation. but that's not what elevated gold to $3500 last month. gold didn't spike up because the metal is somehow shinier or denser, or because the future of the us economy looks brilliant. gold moved up along trend lines that are three years in the making. the bottom line is that many people who control vast amounts of wealth realize that america's fiscal and monetary house is totally dysfunctional and unsustainable. the us budget is broken, the national debt is unpayable, the interest will kill the treasury account. will gold keep going up? yes, of course, it's hard to see why not. own gold or you'll live to regret it. sure, expect pullbacks along the way, certainly during market sell-downs and especially if/when there's a crash. we may again see gold under $3000, but not for long. some things are bigger than one president and his term in office.",2
2025-05-03,"the us is over a century getting into the current mess, and we'll be many decades digging out. you had better own some gold as it all plays out.",2
2025-05-01,"silver ratio dive bombs vs. gold article:might silver's low price to gold signal a surge ahead...? no reversal yet in the silver/gold ratio, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole, flipping the more common gold/silver ratio on its head, the better to measure silver in terms of the less useful 'safe haven' precious metal. in fact, quite the contrary as the ratio makes its 5th day fading after a spike last week. the silver/gold ratio, in other words, remains extremely depressed. that in itself is not a big deal. it's a normal consolidation of the spike. but the nominal silver price, which had been conspicuously strong above its 50-day moving average despite the correction in gold and the miners, is slipping said level. if that is an indication of things to come, the sector correction should continue and other areas in commodities/resources could come under renewed pressure. a reversal in the silver/gold ratio would trigger a positive market for commodities/resources. the question is, will the recent dive bomb in the silver price vs. the gold price prove to be a pivotal event, as it did in 2020? will a reversal in the silver/gold ratio come from this drop? if so, given relatively less downside intensity than 2020, i'd expect the upside to be highly tradable, but more moderate (sorry my silver buggish friends). (by the way, above, and outside of the p-51 mustang, the junkers ju87 'stuka' dive bomber was this wwii fighter dork's favorite of the era.",0
2025-05-01,"it's a bomber, but work with me here. it was so awkward and clumsy.) silver, with more cyclical industrial utility than gold, would lead if inflationary pressures build up and/or renewed enthusiasm against a coming recession/bust were to manifest. further implications would be for strength in the precious metals miners, despite a currently in-process healthy pullback, and further weakness in the us dollar, which has been bearish for the entirety of trump's term. as a side note, usd is due for a bounce or rally. but ""due"" implies a time variable. meanwhile, the tsx-v index, home of the most speculative canadian commodity/resource related stocks, has ticked a new high for its bottom/upturn cycle. the 'v' seems to think silver will take over from gold, potentially providing a backdrop for wider commodity participation. only time will tell if this will play out, but it's interesting goings-on in a macro stimulated by an awful lot of geopolitical input.",0

2025-04-21,"the reality of trump's coal economics article:fossil fuels below 50% of us electricity output... between raising and lowering tariffs on imported goods, president donald trump made time to sign an executive order aimed at reviving america's ""beautiful clean coal industry"", writes frank holmes at us global investors. the order outlines an ambitious strategy to reclassify coal as a critical mineral, reopen federal lands to mining, fast-track environmental reviews and provide federal support for coal-fired electricity and coal exports. the move comes at a pivotal time. demand for electricity is surging as the us seeks to reindustrialize and build out new infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (ai) data centers, electric vehicles (evs) and high-performance computing. according to s&p global, the us will see greater electricity demand growth in the next decade than in any ten-year period in history. shares of peabody energy − the largest us coal producer, responsible for mining over 104,000 short tons in 2023 − closed up 9.21% on the tuesday of trump's big tariff crash bounce. that was the company's best one-day increase since 6 november 2024, the day after trump won his second term. over the longer term, however, peabody's stock has plummeted, losing close to 60% of its value since election day. i admire the president's focus on strengthening us energy security. reliable, affordable power is the bedrock of economic growth and national competitiveness.",0
2025-04-21,"while i understand his intent, i believe the long-term investment case is moving in a different direction − and it's one that leans heavily toward renewables. coal is often described as a powerful energy source, and indeed it helped build the industrial age. but today, coal is struggling to compete on cost. the levelized cost of electricity (lcoe) for new coal plants is more than double that of solar, wind and natural gas, according to bloombergnef. and that's before factoring in the environmental and public health costs of coal extraction and combustion. the simple truth is that coal is no longer the cheapest or cleanest option. the market knows this. coal's share of power generation in advanced economies has been in steady decline since it peaked in 2007, according to the international energy agency (iea). in the us, coal fell below 15% for the first time ever in 2024, and the trend is accelerating. the institute for energy economics and financial analysis (ieefa) projects that the remaining 115,000 megawatts (mw) of coal capacity could be shuttered by 2040. nearly a quarter of the existing us coal fleet is already scheduled to retire by 2029. many of the plants still online are operating far below capacity. reopening closed plants, or extending the lives of aging ones, is highly inefficient. maintenance costs increase with age, and many units are now over 50 years old. the last large coal plant built in the us came online in 2013, and since then, the pipeline has run dry.",0
2025-04-21,"it's no secret that the global energy makeup is transitioning. coal generation hit a new record high in 2024, largely due to growth in emerging markets, but even in china and india, two of the world's largest coal consumers, ambitious plans are underway to increase cleaner energy. china led the world in solar additions in 2024, while india is scaling up renewables to meet its growing energy needs. the us saw coal consumption fall 4% last year, on top of a 17% drop in 2023. meanwhile, renewables are setting new records. just last month, us wind and solar generation hit an all-time high of 83 terawatt-hours (twh), while fossil fuels' share of the electricity mix fell below 50% for the first time ever. it's clear where the wind is blowing. i believe this trend represents an attractive investment opportunity. renewable capacity additions around the world surged by 25% last year, led by solar and wind. solar alone is expected to account for more than half of all new generating capacity in the us this year, with my home state of texas leading the way. more than a third of all new solar panels is expected to be installed right here. what's even more compelling is that renewables are now cheaper not just than building new coal plants − they're cheaper than operating most existing coal plants. according to energy innovation, 99% of us coal plants could be replaced with new solar or wind at a lower cost.",0
2025-04-21,"again, i agree with president trump that ai and data centers will be massive energy consumers in the coming years. as executive chairman of hive digital technologies, i should know. between now and 2030, electricity consumption by data centers alone is set to more than double to an estimated 945 twh. pinning our hopes on coal to meet those needs is a backward-looking solution, i believe. coal may see a temporary boost from regulatory relief, and some investors may profit in the short term. but in the long run, i think the writing is on the wall. the global transition to cleaner, cheaper energy is well underway. investors who want to stay ahead of the curve should follow the data and the money.",0

""of course, none of this is sure to work; otherwise, investors would be happy to hold their nerve. after all, human nature fears loss twice as much as gains; the adjustment can continue for some time. ""the new administration has achieved its objective of removing the trump put. it needs to collect funds into its safe-haven treasuries before it executes a pivot back to risk. ""however, every stage of this process is fraught with danger."" in an earlier post from the weekend of april 5th/6th, jeremy made the following comparison: ""this is america's brexit. this is when global investors re-assess their belief in american exceptionalism, or at least the price they are being asked to pay for it. as with brexit, rational economic man cannot comprehend the degree to which some are prepared to take short-term pain for their longer-term ambition.",0
2025-04-10,"in this case, the price the us administration is prepared to pay to restore manufacturing jobs to detroit and the wider us rust belt. this is maga 2.0 in action and damn the torpedoes!"" we agree. the original brexit vote marked the point at which british blue-collar workers issued a definitive vote of no confidence in the globalist experiment, complete with offshoring, a hollowing-out of traditional industry, and unwanted mass migration, known as the european union. predictably, this vote was ignored by the so-called elites in london and brussels. trump 2.0 may prove a harder nut to crack. trump doesn't (personally) have to worry about re-election, so he can spend some quality time as a wrecking ball of change, and seizing the nettle of the us' unsustainable debt load. whether by accident or design, and probably the latter, tariff chaos helps lower us sovereign borrowing costs in a year when roughly $9 trillion will mature or need to be refinanced. we happen to think that the damage done to us sovereign creditworthiness and credibility by the biden administration egging on the freezing of russian foreign reserves was and is irreversible: that particular genie is not going back in the bottle. so we remain of the view that the future involves a concentration on real assets as opposed to the illusion of fiat ones.",0

2025-04-08,"now averaging 90.0 ounces of silver so far in 2025, the price of gold has topped covid's 2020 economic depression annual average of 89.1, as well as the global recession of 1991's annual average of 89.3, when the ratio touched 100 for just 1 day. that speaks to just how awful the economic outlook has become. useful stuff? yours! useless safe haven? buy! or at least, hold. but this spike in the gold-silver ratio is also, so far, driving a surge in silver demand among contrarian investors. net purchases by bullionvault users have now totalled over 12 tonnes inside 6 days since trump unveiled his big, beautiful tariffs. that reverses 90% of last month's net selling, when the gold/silver ratio averaged just below 90. on a daily basis, it's running at 2/3rds the pace of march 2020, when bullionvault users hoovered up a record 96.9 tonnes of the indispensable metal in 1 month. meanwhile, and like gold, silver has seen the price gap in new york futures over london physical collapse after the white house decided to exempt bullion from the liberation day tariffs, just like everyone (should have) expected. but while the incentive for shipping yet more gold into us comex warehouses has now dipped below $10 on the most-active june contract... ...around half the level you'd expect here in early april... ...the gap between london silver and new york's may contract has evaporated entirely, running at precisely 0 cents per ounce as the weekend began and actually going negative today.",0

2025-04-08,"back to 1909 with trump's tariffs article:global trade war explodes... ouch, says frank holmes at us global investors. global markets are in freefall in response to president donald trump's universal 10% tariff on all goods being imported into the us, with as many as 60 countries facing ""reciprocal"" tariffs on top of that. when we combine all new tariffs in 2025 so far, including the raft of reciprocal tariffs announced last wednesday, we're looking at an average effective rate of 22.5%, according to yale's budget lab. that's the highest such rate since 1909 − the same year that president howard taft proposed the idea of an income tax to congress. as i have pointed out before, tariffs are a type of tax paid for by domestic import-export companies, who often pass the additional cost on to consumers. this can turbocharge domestic inflation. tariffs can also lead to full-blown trade wars, as we saw in the federal government's previous attempts to raise revenue through the taxation of imported goods. the smoot-hawley tariff act, enacted in 1930, is widely believed to have exacerbated the effects of the great depression, as global trade tanked a whopping 65%. a few decades prior, then-representative william mckinley's tariff act triggered retaliation from other nations, leading to higher prices for us consumers. (if you need to brush up on your smoot-hawley history, i recommend the famous ""anyone?",0
2025-04-08,"anyone?"" scene in 1986's ferris bueller's day off.) as was the case then, we're already seeing retaliatory tariffs. china announced that it will impose a 34% duty on all goods imported from the us. if this weren't enough, automobile imports face a steep 25% tariff. trump claims he ""couldn't care less"" if foreign manufacturers raise prices for us consumers, and from the looks of it, they may need to − and significantly so, in some cases. mitsubishi, for instance, will need to increase the price of its vehicles by more than 20% here in the us to offset the new levy, according to estimates by clsa. the manufacturer expected to fare the best under this tariff regime is tesla, whose supply chain is well-integrated in the us. more than 62% of the company's facilities are located domestically, with approximately a quarter of its suppliers also based in the us, according to bloomberg data. by comparison, fewer than half of ford's facilities worldwide are currently located in the us. this could be constructive for tesla, whose stock has lost over half of its value since its peak in mid-december, making it one of the worst performers of the year so far. the carmaker's quarterly sales fell a significant 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due mainly to political backlash against ceo elon musk. when it comes to new home purchases, bad economic news could be good news.",0
2025-04-08,"mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year treasury, which dropped below 4% on friday due to concerns about the trade war. bond yields generally fall when prices rise. granted, home prices in the us are still hovering near record highs, but current homeowners may be able to refinance sooner than expected. lower yields are also good for gold. because it's a non-interest-bearing asset, gold starts to look more attractive as yields fall, especially when inflation remains historically elevated, as it is now. the 10-year yield is nominally 4.1% right now, but when you factor in the 2.8% headline inflation rate from february, the real yield is closer to 1.3%. if yields fall further or if inflation jumps higher due to tariffs, we may end up with negative real yields, which have historically been bullish for gold prices. the yellow metal is trading down as it's swept up in the broader selloff, and i believe investors should strongly consider buying these dips. gold just notched its best quarter since 1986, ending march at $3123 per troy ounce, and there could be further upside momentum.",0
2025-04-06,"spanners, wrenches, steepener and gold article:cue gold's perfect macro to strike... a man sits in the white house, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. a different kind of man. a man who does not like diplomacy or going along and getting along with his global counterparts. he likes throwing spanners and monkey wrenches all around the macro. there may one day be revealed a positive outcome to this, through negotiations. but on the face of it, nobody wins a tariff war. least of all the biggest consumerist nation on the planet. ignore the media panic. it's all noise. it's real, but for the sake of where we are going – and have been indicated to be going for over a year now – it is noise. recession signals kicked in when yield curves steepened and de-inverted. always disregard the media's view on yield curves, which in 2023 was that the deep inversion meant imminent recession. the media harvested many eyeballs with that ill-conceived fear campaign as the economy remained firm and the ""boom"" side of the boom/bust continuum, well, continued. it's the subsequent curve steepener that gets ya. we married other indicators to the yield curve view in 2024 for a clear picture of an oncoming recession, economic counter-cycle and waning of confidence. these are primary considerations for a bullish fundamental view of the counter-cyclical gold mining sector.",0
2025-04-06,"i used the macrocosm (the larger the planet, the more important the fundamental consideration for gold stocks) for all too many years to illustrate why a proper and sustainable macro backdrop was not in place for gold stocks. for much of the last year it has increasingly confirmed, rather than denied a positive backdrop for gold mining. from 2004 to 2024 the economy was boosted by inflationary policy-making more often than not. and every downturn (most dynamically, in 2020) was met with balls out policy. hence, jupiter was never allowed to engage beyond quick events, as policymakers reliably sprang into action to mop up the situation with interest rate and bond market manipulation, the mechanics of money printing and inflation. saturn came into alignment as yield curves aborted their deep inversions and began to steepen in 2023. then last year, they de-inverted (an economic boom runs with a flattening toward or to inversion, a bust runs with a steepener) and the coming economic down cycle came closer into view. saturn fully engaged when gold's ratio to the last inflated man standing, the s&p 500, busted upward just recently. the gold/silver ratio is a wild card as silver can sure lead the precious metals complex. but speaking purely as a fundamentalist, gold rising in silver terms is more aligned with proper gold mining fundamentals, since silver has much more cyclical/industrial utility than gold. all the other planets are in fine form as well.",0
2025-04-06,"a couple notes: some planets should be larger (but i had to work with the art i had). specifically, stagflation, which is a very viable outcome of a global trade war. cyclical inflation and china/india love trades are provided because there were two tiny little planets that needed to be assigned a level of importance. that level is minuscule and is really just for comic relief, especially when you think about promotional interests out there touting these elements as serious gold stock fundamentals to their herds. the bottom line is that we are now in the macrocosm, some 12 years (+/-) after i came up with the pictorial view of what we would look for to be real fundamental gold mining bulls. it is fully engaged. gold miners (gdx) had been a card carrying member of the broad stock market rally until the election slammed the counter-cyclical sector on trump economic optimism. as the realities of the initial destructiveness of a global tariff war become more widely known, the counter-cyclical sector has rallied while the cyclical stock market has tanked. makes sense, folks. don't over-think it. the gold mining case dearly needed gold to outperform the stock market and that is what is happening. by extension, so too are the miners now outperforming the stock market. using the monthly chart of hui, we have noted a painfully volatile bull market that began in 2016.",0
2025-04-06,"you may recall that back then, by mid-year the initial launch was doomed because silver was leading gold, then commodities and stock markets. it was an inflationary move for the macro. wrong setup! silver bugs led the charge and the whole cacophony topped out that summer, after we noted the degrading fundamentals as the pumpers pumped. since then huey has ground its way to a low in 2018, a high in 2020, a low in 2022 and voila, here we are on a wave 5. it is likely that hui will pause or pull back here at or above resistance. our minimum target has been to make a higher high to 2020's 373. the operating target of 500 may not be the ultimate target. it's just been the objective we've had since bottoming out at '4'. unlike in 2016, the proper backdrop is in play. what we have developing now is a deflationary situation. why, just look at treasury bonds, which i've held and increased as cash equivalents, rising nominally and paying income, as illustrated in nftrh each weekend. the inflation hysteria blew out in 2023. i do expect the 30-year treasury yield ""continuum"" (another of my indicators that has a nickname) to find support prior to the next phase of inflation. but first, a deflationary liquidity episode despite or maybe because of the man throwing wrenches all over the place. later will come the next inflation phase, and it will likely be of the stag variety. in other words, economically corrosive.",0
2025-04-06,"above is the state of the continuum, which i expect to decline as the fed weakens and the macro contracts over the coming months. take note of the red trend lines that had so well resisted the yield for decades. it was busted in 2022 and has now turned up. a decline in the 30-year yield to approximately that level (roughly the 3.5% area) could be all she wrote for the deflation play before the next and more painful inflationary phase engages. gold mining stocks are counter-cyclical. a counter-cyclical backdrop was indicated to be engaging last year, but the biden administration's predictable fiscal operations kept the macro picture intact into the election. this was a major theme we carried all though 2024, right into november, after which the theme was that trump would be left with an unwinding macro. i just did not know about how many spanners and monkeys he was planning to throw around to help it along. nftrh is locked in on events that are in play because they are what we have anticipated and patiently awaited. you can trust me to call what i see, not what i want to see or worse, what you may want to see. finally, i am able to call the macro in a favorable way for gold stocks. the going will be volatile, but we are in a new macro, one that is finally aligned for the gold stock sector.",0

2025-04-01,"the us president's tariff strategy and his increasingly volatile stance on russia's war against ukraine are proving the perfect chaos for new record gold prices, stronger even than the covid catastrophe of five years ago. the precious metal thrives on geopolitical uncertainty, economic stagflation and falling stock markets. trump is delivering all three. like net demand by weight, the gold investor index – a unique measure of sentiment which tracks the number of buyers against the number of people choosing to sell – also rose to its strongest quarterly reading since spring 2023, averaging 54.5 between january and march and rising 0.2 points from the final 3 months of last year. compared to q1 last year, when the gold investor index set a record quarterly low of 50.5, the index has risen by 4.1 points, its sharpest four-quarter increase since the covid crisis of 2020. any reading on the gold investor index above 50.0 signals more buyers than sellers using bullionvault. the index set a monthly low of 47.5 last march as gold crossed above $2100 per troy ounce for the first time, spurring record-heavy profit-taking among gold investors. but with gold ending monday almost $1000 higher, the gold investor index read 54.6, exactly in line with its long-term average and down by 1.7 from february's leap to a 45-month high. so while the pace of gold's gains is rightly making headlines, the upturn in gold investment demand remains very measured to date.",2
2025-04-01,"gold's latest run of fresh record highs continues to attract new buyers. but rather than any kind of mania, gold is still recovering from last year's low demand and profit-taking. its appeal, like the price, could yet have much further to run if trump's policies tip the stock-market correction into a crash. the number of new accounts opened to invest in physical precious metals on bullionvault last month slipped 4.0% from the near-4 year high seen in february. that still put it 40.5% above the prior 12-month average, led by strong growth in france, italy, the uk and germany. silver prices also rose sharply in q1, increasing by 15.5% in us dollar terms – the fastest quarterly gain since q4 2022 – and setting new all-time highs for uk pound and euro investors on a quarterly-average basis. but in contrast to gold, silver continued to meet net selling by private investors, with bullionvault users cutting their combined holdings by 13.8 tonnes since new year (-1.2%) to the lowest by weight since december 2020 at 1,142 tonnes. by value, bullionvault clients' silver holdings rose 14.2% across q1 to a new month-end record of $1.2 billion (£967m, €1.1bn, ¥187bn). but the silver investor index, again tracking the number of buyers against sellers, halved february's 2.2 point rise in march, dropping back to 50.8 and putting the quarterly reading at 50.8.",2

""the proposition that trump's policies might hurt the economy isn't liberal propaganda,"" bleats msnbc. ""last year, elon musk literally predicted his and trump's economic policies would crash the economy."" such whining isn't new. the 'liberal media' began hyperventilating about trump 2.0 causing a recession as far back as 2023. and lo. now the maga white house agrees with them!

""no exit ramp for fed's powell until he creates a recession,"" agreed cnbc in march 2023, quoting yet another economist repeating the central bankers' consensus. never mind they were wrong. the highest us interest rates in more than 2 decades coincided with inflation dropping sharply (although not as low as the fed's 2.0% target) while failing to provoke a recession.",2
2025-03-20,"but that's not how it's meant to go. the way that monetary policy is supposed to work, capping or curbing inflation, is by hurting the economy. or so everyone agrees. it puts people out of work, thereby cooling consumer and industrial demand... ...taking the heat out of inflation. which is all for the good, in the long run. never mind if it costs you work or your business. whereas with trump...? wednesday saw the federal reserve...led by 'high-rates' powell...leave overnight interest rates unchanged while unveiling its latest forecasts for inflation, unemployment, the economy, and interest rates. looking ahead, the federal reserve also issued its new 'dot plot' forecasts for where committee members expect us interest rates to end 2025. on average, they left that prediction at 3.9%... ...down 0.4 points from today... ...and the same forecast which the fed's dot plot gave back in december, when it hiked that prediction by half-a-point from september's guess. simply put, rates are going to stay higher than the fed thought on the eve of the election, and the cost of borrowing is also going to stay higher than both inflation and gdp growth, even though the fed now thinks that the pace of us economic expansion will weaken (what with trump in the white house and all) while it also thinks inflation will accelerate (what with trump in the white house and all).",2

2025-03-20,"we know neither james cordier nor his former business, optionsellers.com, so we can't tell whether his tears on the video are crocodilian or absolutely genuine. but we would make the following observations. the term 'hedge fund' used to mean something. it meant that high net worth investors sought a hedge against the inherent risk of traditional financial markets (ie, stocks and bonds) by diversifying into a form of investment vehicle that attempted to mitigate that risk. 'hedge funds' did not start out as speculative investment vehicles, far from it. the original hedge funds were, as their name implies, looking to hedge risk, not to add to it. but as the hedge fund community grew in size, a seemingly endless number of greedy chancers jumped on board, attracted by the opportunity to charge clients both a 2% annual fee on assets under management and, typically, a 20% share of any positive performance on top. just the 2% (the so-called ""carried interest"") would make any reasonably sized hedge fund manager rich, irrespective of their subsequent returns. the 20% performance share would, however, ensure riches beyond the dreams of avarice for the luckier high stakes gamblers out there. volatility in the oil and natural gas markets is nothing new. what james cordier refers to as the ship swamped by a rogue wave has happened on innumerable occasions before. see, for example, amaranth. amaranth advisors, at its peak, was a hedge fund that had $9 billion under management.",2
2025-03-20,"although the fund had started out as a specialist in a strategy known as convertible arbitrage (which typically involves the purchase of convertible bonds and the simultaneous sale of related common stock), by 2005 the fund had shifted its focus onto energy trading and the natural gas market, influenced by its canadian trader brian hunter. there's just one thing you need to know about the commodities market. it's volatile. hunter speculated wildly in the natural gas market and ended up losing $6.5 billion. long story short: hedge funds have morphed over the last 30 or so years from a relatively low risk way for wealthy private investors to diversify their portfolio risk into a wild west of entirely unconstrained strategies ranging from conservative to ultra-aggressive, and in which the principle of 'hedging' and portfolio insurance has been cast to the winds. given the 2% and 20% model that some hedge fund managers still use, you can hear the sound of the world's smallest violins playing just for them. there are no such things as 'rogue waves' in the financial markets. or rather, if there are, then the traders blindsided by them have no fundamental understanding of the inherent wildness of markets. the requisite book for interested readers is benoit mandelbrot's the (mis)behaviour of markets. the following extract is from our own book investing through the looking glass, which devotes almost an entire chapter to mandelbrot.",2
2025-03-20,"investors – especially those engaging with the commodity markets – are strongly advised to consider the following of mandelbrot's observations. rule 1: markets are riskier than we think. and certainly riskier than conventional financial theory thinks. price movements do not happily track the bell curve. extreme price swings are not the exception. they are the norm. rule 2: trouble runs in streaks. or as shakespeare put it, ""when sorrows come, they come not single spies / but in battalions!"" market turbulence does not arise out of a clear blue sky and then disappear. it tends to cluster. a wild market open may well be followed by an equally desperate full trading session. a chaotic monday may well be followed by an even more chaotic tuesday. rule 3: markets have their own personality. the father of value investing, benjamin graham, famously created the manic depressive character mr market to account for the stock market's constant oscillations between greed and fear. but when individual investors, institutional fund managers, hedge funds, day traders and sovereign wealth funds come together in a real marketplace, a new kind of market personality emerges – both greater than, and different from, the sum of its constituent parts. mandelbrot suggests that market prices are determined by endogenous effects specific to the inner workings of those markets, rather than by exogenous, external events.",2
2025-03-20,"for example, his analysis of cotton prices during the last century showed the same broad pattern of price variability when prices were unregulated as they did in the 1930s when cotton prices were regulated as part of roosevelt's new deal. rule 4: markets mislead. in mandelbrot's words, ""patterns are the fool's gold of financial markets."" the workings of random chance create patterns, and human beings are pattern recognition experts. we see patterns even where none exist and financial markets are especially prone to statistical mirages. following from this, bubbles and crashes are inherent to financial markets and ""the inevitable consequence of the human need to find patterns in the patternless."" rule 5: market time is relative. just as the market has its own personality, so it has its own time signature. professional traders often speak of a fast or slow market, depending on their assessment of volatility at the time in question. in a fast market, things like market-, stop- or limit orders have limited utility. prices don't necessarily glide smoothly within narrow ranges. sometimes they gap down or leap up, effortlessly vaulting beyond price limits presumed to protect portfolios from ruin. traditional economists – if they've thought about the financial markets at all – have tended to treat them as a kind of closed system that obeys rigid and pre-set natural laws. mandelbrot showed that the financial markets are altogether wilder than that.",2
2025-03-20,"another class of economists would recognise the inherent unpredictability of financial markets and the broader economy, and give them both the respect they deserved – the so-called austrian school. far from trying to maximise returns for our clients, we are trying to do something far subtler: participate as much as possible in the upside potential of the investment markets, while attempting to limit the downside as far as practicable. to this extent our investment objective is asymmetrical. we're not interested in simply tracking the market – if we assume, as it is for most people, that ""the market"" is essentially the market for common stocks. we're far more interested in absolute returns than market-relative ones. unfortunately for all of us, most fund managers don't think that way. don't allow exploded hedge fund managers to control the narrative. only by understanding the risks inherent in investing (and in speculative trading) do we have a chance of navigating the squalls to come, and of our portfolios surviving them. a third of a century of working within the financial markets has convinced us that our greatest enemy is ourselves; more specifically, our genetically inherited 'fight or flight' response honed over hundreds of thousands of years has limited application in financial markets that mankind has only experienced over the last two centuries or so.",2

2025-03-18,"the presence of gold in the reserves can enhance trust and confidence in a country's economic stability. for an individual, the possession of vaulted bullion can provide similar confidence. investment gold held by central banks takes the form of 400oz (12.4kg) bars with a minimum fineness of 99.5%. unlike stocks, which can be highly volatile, or bonds, which are susceptible to interest rate fluctuations, gold offers a tangible asset that is not directly tied to the performance of companies or governments. while stocks and bonds can yield higher returns in a bullish market, gold has continued to be a popular option for diversification, risk management, and long-term security and has been the best performing asset so far this century. source: bullionvault via world gold council, lbma aerospace gold is an increasingly valuable resource in the aerospace industry, owing to its unique properties and versatility. one of its primary applications is in the creation of reliable electrical connectors and bonding wires, where the metal’s conductivity and resistance to corrosion ensure that electrical connections remain stable and effective under the harsh conditions of space, where other metals might degrade. gold is also used in coating aerospace components to enhance radiation shielding. in the vacuum of space, spacecraft are exposed to intense solar radiation, which can damage sensitive instruments.",0
2025-03-18,"gold's reflective properties help mitigate this by bouncing off harmful rays, protecting onboard equipment. the metal is also used in visors in astronauts’ helmets to provide uv protection. in thermal control systems, gold’s ability to reflect infra-red radiation is crucial in managing the temperature of spacecraft, allowing instruments to operate within their optimal ranges. this is particularly vital for missions involving satellites and space probes, which encounter extreme thermal variations. as more satellites are placed into orbit, the requirement for gold – as an indispensable element in the advancement of space technology - increases. electronics gold also plays a pivotal role in the production of electronic items. as with many other industrial uses of gold, the metal’s conductivity and reliability is key, allowing the seamless flow of electric current and ensuring efficiency in electronic circuit boards: the power behind the world’s laptops and smartphones. gold's resistance to corrosion makes it an ideal choice for manufacturing connectors, switches, and relay contacts. unlike many other metals, gold does not oxidize, ensuring long-lasting and stable connections. this is essential for devices that require high precision and reliability, such as computers, smartphones, and medical equipment.",0

2025-03-18,"gold has retained and even increased its usefulness through the application of gold nanoparticles in innovative technologies, including supporting renewable energy and in modern diagnostics. what properties of gold make it useful in industrial processes? gold has high electrical conductivity, excellent resistance to corrosion, high malleability and ductility, and chemical inertness. these properties make it ideal for usage in electrical components, the aerospace industry and in medical technology. gold's malleability allows it to be drawn into thin wires and sheets, leading to its use in intricate applications. gold's catalytic properties also make it valuable in chemical processes within fuel cells and automotive catalysts. its biocompatibility ensures its safe use in medical devices and implants. is gold used in any environmental applications? gold is being explored for use in environmental applications such as pollution control and clean energy solutions, due to its catalytic properties. gold nanoparticles’ large surface area and ability to act as catalysts make them ideal for breaking down harmful substances, leading to use in catalytic converters and water purification systems. in environmental monitoring, sensors utilize the conductive properties of gold to detect changes in the environment, allowing for prompt action to mitigate pollution. what role will gold play in future technologies?",0
2025-03-18,"gold nanoparticles are being used in cutting-edge medical technology and in sustainable energy innovations. gold’s properties make it ideal for the manufacture of qubits, the building blocks of quantum computing. advances in nanotechnology, materials science, and engineering continue to uncover new ways to harness gold's properties, and as the demands for clean energy, pollution control, and environmental monitoring grow, along with advances in wearables and space technology, gold's properties mean that the metal’s role is expected to expand – while maintaining its traditional uses as investment, decoration and store of wealth.",0
2025-03-18,"gold up, inflation next article:same thing, in truth... when the price of gold rises – in other words, when more money is needed to buy an ounce of gold – that usually means that the dollar's value has decreased, writes nathan lewis of new world economics, quoting his 2022 book inflation: what it is, why it's bad, and how to fix it in this article first published at forbes. daily price movements may not be significant. but, if the price goes up and stays there for an extended period, or if it fluctuates but the general trend is up, that signals a downturn in the value of the dollar. when we first wrote this in 2022, it took about $1800 to buy an ounce of gold. today, it is more like $2900. that implies an $1800/$2900 = 0.621 or a 38% decline in dollar value over that period. prices will eventually adjust, over a period of years, to the new, lower value of the currency, with some prices moving faster and some moving slower. ""all things being equal"" (they never are but it is a good principle), we should expect a $2900/$1800 or 61% rise in prices of goods and services going forward, compared even to the inflation-boosted prices that we have had to get used to in 2022-2024. compared to prices in 2018, when it took about $1200 to buy an ounce of gold, we should expect a $2900/$1200 or 141% increase in nominal prices. doesn't seem like much fun, does it. this is why we say ""you can't devalue yourself to prosperity."" no country ever got rich with a weak currency.",2
2025-03-18,"they get rich with a stable and reliable currency, which means: a currency of unchanging stable value. you would have to increase your nominal income by 141% just to break even. maybe more than that, on an after-tax basis. even if we do accomplish this, eventually, what it would mean is that we broke even, over a period of perhaps ten years. instead of getting richer over ten years, we just made it back to flat. in other words, stagnation. this is basically why the latin american countries never get anywhere. they are always just catching up to the chronic depreciation of their currencies. this might be confusing to some people, especially those with ""monetarist"" leanings, and also those with ""keynesian"" leanings – between them encompassing 90%+ of all formally-trained economists. the ""monetarists"" are concerned with ""money supply"". they have a sort of narrative which goes like this: expanding the money supply leads to more money chasing fewer goods, leading to rising prices. it is actually a pattern common throughout history, related to inflationary wartime finance. but, that has not been the common pattern since the bretton woods international gold standard era ended in 1971. instead, what we tend to see is: a currency loses value, for whatever reason. often, there is no particularly unusual ""expansion of the money supply"" going on, or any pressure from governments to somehow finance deficits with the printing press.",2
2025-03-18,"it doesn't fit the monetarist narrative at all – which is why they can't figure out what's going on. later, as the economy reacts to this decline in currency value, nominal prices and nominal gdp tend to climb. central banks typically ""accommodate"" this greater nominal gdp with a proportional increase in base money supply. during the 1970s, the whole world suffered from dramatic ""inflation"". the value of the dollar fell from $35 per ounce during the 1960s, to around $350 per ounce during the 1980s and 1990s. it was a 10:1 or 90% decline in the value of the dollar, compared to gold. commodity prices, and prices for everything else too, verified that the decline in the dollar vs. gold reflected a real decline in dollar value. oil rose from $3 a barrel in the 1960s to around $20 in the 1980s and 1990s. but, there was no particular ""expansion of the money supply"" going on during that whole decade. it wasn't much different than the gold standard era of the 1960s, or the disinflationary ""great moderation"" of the 1980s and 1990s. government deficits were relatively small, and ""printing press finance"" was nowhere to be seen. during the 2000s, another major decline in the value of the dollar vs. gold took place. from an average of about $350 per ounce during the 1990s, it fell to about $1200 in the 2012-2019 period – roughly a 4:1 decline. commodity prices again soared higher, confirming that the dollar's real value was indeed declining.",2

2025-02-19,"back in the third quarter of the 20th century...back before the 'end of history' marked the 'end of gold' for european central banks enjoying the victory of western capitalism over soviet communism...the almighty dollar supported the world's entire monetary system under the bretton woods agreement signed as the us-led allies pushed towards berlin in 1944. every other major currency was valued in terms of the greenback, and gold in turn backed the dollar. or rather, it backed 25% of the dollars in issue, as per the federal reserve act. so it was only by holding either gold or dollars (or better still, lots of both) that sovereign governments could hope to settle their international spending and debts with each other. ""gold and currencies backed by gold [became] the foundation of our international credit,"" as bond is briefed by smithers in goldfinger. ""we can only tell what the true strength of the pound is, and other countries can only tell it, by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency."" sitting atop this system...the ""gold exchange standard"" as it's sometimes known...the us dollar clung onto its position as the world's no.1 currency thanks to the sheer size of us national gold reserves. they'd risen three times over between the mid-1920s and the defeat of japan 2 decades later, hitting more than 20,000 tonnes by the late 1940s.",2
2025-02-19,"at its peak, america's nationalized gold reserve – the single greatest gold hoard on earth – accounted for almost one-in-four-ounces ever mined in world history. but being the king makes it tough to sleep some nights, and for most of the bretton woods period, from the end of wwii until 1971, washington tossed and turned. because if the us gold reserve fell, transferring real wealth overseas, it risked taking the dollar's position as ""top dog"" along with it. ""we now have $21 billion worth of refined uranium and plutonium,"" said a desperate dwight eisenhower at a meeting with his senior white house advisors on 9th november, 1960. ""this has great future value as a source of power,"" not least because it now topped the market-value of america's national gold holdings. so ""could it be substituted for gold?"" the president asked, proposing a new bed-rock for us monetary reserves and, therefore, for the world. eisenhower's question – though bone-headed and ""politely dismissed"" as francis gavin relates in his excellent 2004 history, gold, dollars & power – was urgent. america's nuclear arsenal already supported its political power. could plutonium sustain us monetary might as well? well...no. ""the great thing to remember about gold,"" as colonel smithers goes on in goldfinger, ""is that it's the most valuable and easily marketable commodity in the world."" that still holds true today, six decades later.",2
2025-02-19,"wholesale gold bullion – traded by professional dealers, refineries, bullion banks, central banks, and private investors choosing to use bullionvault – represents one of the world's deepest and most liquid capital markets. there is always a ""clearing price"" at which buyers and sellers will trade. because gold's intrinsic value, the fact that it stores wealth in itself, rather than by deferring that value to some other asset, promise or production, is its only utility. industrial and medical uses barely count against the volume of gold held for its wealth-content alone. whereas money backed by uranium, crude oil, plutonium or copper would be instantly trumped by their value as industrial assets – rare and valuable items, to be sure, but valued for their productive uses instead. back in november 1960, meantime, secretary of state christian anderson had called that meeting at eisenhower's white house meeting because the government-owned us gold reserve... ...fixed vs. the dollar at an unchanging value of $35 per ounce since 1933... ...was about to slip below $18 billion ""for the first time in many, many years."" that was a lot of money in those days, but too little for comfort. why? as the chart shows, the mid-1960s found america's balance of trade tipping into a deficit. it has rarely looked back.",2
2025-02-19,"because the usa still gets to pay the world in dollars... ...and those dollars ""[are not] an impartial and international trade medium [but] in fact a credit instrument reserved for one state only,"" as french president charles de gaulle spat in 1965. so france (and germany, among others) kept demanding gold rather than accepting us dollars at face value and sitting on paper in payment. that was their right under the post-wwii bretton woods agreement... ...a right exercised whenever the supply of dollars looked likely to force a revaluation of its gold backing... ...and a right finally lost when richard nixon stopped redeeming dollars for gold in august 1971. nixon's decision to float the entire world off gold and onto pure faith alone is often seen as a ""crime"", an affront to fair dealing and honest money which is to blame for, well, everything you can think of. and nixon certainly stuffed america's creditors, devaluing the dollar by 100% compared with the promised ratio of $35 an ounce. runaway inflation then followed as us dollars flooded the world, lacking any ""hard asset"" backing to limit their growth. in less than a decade, the gold value of us dollars sank by 96%, pushing the gold price up to a peak of $850 per ounce. gold has of course gone higher again since 1980, topping $2900 for the first time ever this month.",2
2025-02-19,"but in closing the ""gold window"" at the federal reserve – and thereby destroying the bretton woods exchange standard – nixon was only completing a process begun before the first world war started in 1914. yes, tricky dicky locked up america's gold reserve from foreign governments demanding hard assets in payment of debt. but more crucially in the great arc of monetary politics, nixon also pushed us gold farther away from private circulation. barring the us treasury's late-1970s sales, in fact, he effectively made those reserves vanish from the face of the earth. ""in the ian fleming novel,"" writes francis gavin – then a professor at the university of texas at austin, now at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies – ""the sinister goldfinger, ably assisted by pussy galore, plotted to steal the american gold supply from fort knox. ""the movie [of 1964] added an interesting twist to the book's improbable scenario...goldfinger tells agent 007 that he does not have to remove the gold physically. instead, he only needs to get inside fort knox and install a timed nuclear device supplied by the people's republic of china. ""the bomb would irradiate all the gold inside the building and make it unusable...international liquidity would seize up, and the western trade and monetary systems would collapse."" it would also make the gold-mad goldfinger's own personal stockpile of the stuff infinitely more valuable.",2
2025-02-19,"luckily for the free world, james bond and pussy galore team up at the end of the film to thwart goldfinger's plan, de-arming the bomb and leaving america's national gold hoard intact. but in reality, richard nixon achieved nothing less than goldfinger's evil scheme in august 1971...and without the fruity charms of pussy galore as encouragement. nixon's decision to halt the outflow of nationalized us gold kept it both safe and secure from foreign powers, and also safe and secure from free circulation outside of government vaults. in effect it was irradiated, put beyond human reach and removed forever from the world's available stock of physical bullion. so what if it's not there? as you might guess from the story so far, all the causes, issues and challenges around america's giant gold reserve aren't very simple. but that doesn't mean the richest man in the world can't reduce it all to a meme grabbed from tv cartoon south park... ...hurr-hurr... ...nor that stopped-clock clowns can't reply with the equally vacuous yet heart-sinkingly inevitable 2020s' riposte: ""bitcoin fixes this."" oh good grief.",2
2025-02-19,"how did it come to this? ""it would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside fort knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of us gold is there,"" said the x.com handle of financial scuttlebutt website zerohedge on saturday. ""last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974."" ""surely it's reviewed at least every year?"" replied the space-and-electric-car mogul now tasked with firing everyone chasing down inefficiency in the us government. ""nope. let's do it,"" chipped in republican senator rand paul. his dad ron has been calling on the feds to allow (if not run) an audit of the us treasury's alleged gold holdings since, well, forever. whether or not the gold is all there should matter, of course. elon musk is hunting out corruption and fraud across the us government. a big hole in the us gold reserves would be bad. but really, what use is that gold anyway? ""it'd be nice for the american people to know whether or not the gold is there,"" said ron paul in 2010 during one of his regular calls for fort knox to be audited.",2
2025-02-19,"is nice a good enough reason? ""the secrecy has given rise to a number of theories about the gold at fort knox and other depositories,"" paul the elder went on the following year when demanding an audit yet again. ""some people speculate that the gold has been involved in gold swaps with foreign governments or bullion banks, others believe that the gold has secretly been shipped out of fort knox and sold, and still others believe that the bars at fort knox are actually gold-plated tungsten."" okay. but what level of audit would properly over-turn such chatter? an audit alone is meaningless. paper records have been checked against paper records many times, as recently as 2023. no, what you need instead is what bullionvault users get every year... ...which is a full inspection and tally-count, checking that all the bars listed on our daily audit (which confirms each working day that the sum total of client holdings matches the sum total of bullion listed on the independent vault operators' records) are present, secure, and in sound condition. thing is, because bullionvault users own a lot of gold (and lots more silver, plus some platinum and palladium...now worth north of $5 billion all told), this takes the independent experts we employ on your behalf many, many days to complete. it's not cheap. but as a belt-and-braces process to confirm that your metal is where it should be, in full, it is vital.",2
2025-02-19,"few competitors bother (especially those who claim to keep metal in their own store-room, rather than using independent specialists for custody to reduce the obvious risk of fraud). hardly any gold-backed etfs go to the trouble of having each and every bar checked either. instead, they do only a 'sample' count and inspection. which is what the us treasury got for its fort knox holdings last time they were checked too, back in 1974. that sampling, of course, was because the usa's apparent gold holdings were (and are) massive, the biggest in the world, well over twice the size of (current, official) no.2 germany. so a full count and inspection would take a very, very long time. but it might feel important if you want to push ahead and audit every branch of government in full. most especially if you want all of those 8,133 tonnes of (reported) gold to be ready for sale... ...y'know, just in case the end of the world arrives... ...or more practically, in case you want to revalue the gold reserve to squeeze a few extra dollars out of the treasury's arrangement with the fed. under the gold reserve act of 1934, the federal reserve handed ownership of all its gold to the department of the treasury. in exchange, the treasury then issued certificates to the fed for the value of the gold, which the fed could then give to the treasury in cash. neat!",2
2025-02-19,"but the value of this accounting trick remains stuck at the treasury's 1973 gold valuation of $42.22 per troy ounce... ...the official gold price frozen in time when the us and its allies finally gave up pretending that the bretton woods system still existed, two years after richard nixon shot it dead... ...whereas gold in the open market today commands a price of $2900 per ounce. cue much excitement around revaluing the us gold reserve to raise $747 billion at the stroke of a pen (albeit following a congressional vote). cue much chatter about what that accounting trick might mean for the market-price of gold... ...plus much gasping around how selling some of that gold outright would crash the market. ""for the mark-to-market change to have any impact,"" says one know-nothing rent-a-quote answering the phone to fortune magazine through the seat of his pants, ""the us would presumably need to sell off some of its gold reserves for cash. ""it's going to be like armageddon if they try to dump any significant amount of gold,"" oh good grief. marking-to-market would need zero gold selling, not ""presumably"" or otherwise. it would raise exactly the sum of cash which selling the whole lot at $2900 would achieve, minus the $11 billion already booked under the $42/oz valuation. this sounds a smart idea. smarter by far than stretching the us mint's authority to spit out a platinum coin with ""$1 trillion"" stamped on its face.",2
2025-02-19,"which was the last monetary-metal accounting trick proposed with a straight face by the charlatans, chancers and fed research team. but as our chart above shows, monetizing the us gold reserve at today's prices wouldn't do much to clean up the united states' fiscal mess. that's the only real lesson worth noting from the current hoo-ha around america's nationalized bullion stock. the biggest hoard of gold in the world... ...valued at the highest gold prices in history... ...isn't enough to cover 4 months of the gap between the federal us government's income and spending. little wonder gold prices keep going higher, hitting the 11th new all-time gold high in dollar terms of 2025 already on wednesday, as foreign creditors and private wealth seek an alternative store of value to american debt. and no. bitcoin doesn't fix that.",2

2025-02-13,"if the growth being forecast for solar energy, electric vehicles, electronics, military and other machinery proves correct over the next 5 years, then silver industrial demand is predicted to grow further, boosting the silver price. can silver prices decline? day-to-day, silver prices typically behave like gold but with greater volatility, both up and down. that can result in steeper losses of value for anyone investing in silver when the price drops, as looking at a silver price chart will confirm. longer term, silver has underperformed the price of gold, perhaps because it doesn't enjoy the demand from central banks which has helped drive the 'safe haven' precious metal higher. but analysts agree that silver's fast-growing industrial demand should continue to support and boost silver prices. silver's versatility and value to industry can't be overstated. 25 years ago the biggest use for silver was in photography, however since the incredible rise of digital cameras and mobile phones, the amount of silver used in the photographic industry has diminished by 90%. if there had not been replacement industrial uses for silver, such as in solar panels, it is logical to expect that the silver price would have fallen significantly in line with that key part of demand.",0

2025-02-11,"his entry into finance was driven by a desire to protect a family's capital. learning through practice: tony's knowledge of finance came from reading and practical application, not from formal financial training. he was motivated by a fear of poverty and doing something wrong, rather than by the pursuit of wealth and fame. value investing influences: he was significantly influenced by the value investing approach. he also developed an early fascination with economic phenomena, seeking to understand money, interest rates, and how the world operates. focus on avoiding errors: tony emphasizes avoiding errors, rather than focusing on achieving big wins. he believes that understanding why companies fail is crucial. he views deploying capital like playing tennis, focusing on not making errors, rather than scoring goals. human element in business: tony believes the human element is the most significant factor in corporate failure. he prefers investing in mediocre companies with great people rather than great companies with mediocre people. he also looks for factors that contribute to a company's longevity. critique of the financial system. markets as a means: tony sees financial markets as a means to an end, similar to a vegetable market for a chef. the market itself is not the goal, but rather a tool for finding quality at the right price. he is more interested in the real economy and those who produce goods.",2

2025-02-07,"ice loss in the danish territory has also exposed significant deposits of lithium, hafnium, uranium and gold. a 2023 survey by the geological survey of denmark and greenland evaluated 38 raw materials on the island, most of which have high or moderate potential. jonathan also pointed out that russia has been quietly building its arctic presence for over a decade. it now has the most significant military presence in the region, with refurbished soviet-era bases and a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers. in 2024, some 38 million metric tons of cargo were shipped through russia's northern sea route (nsr), a record amount for a single year and a nearly tenfold increase from a decade earlier. the nsr is central to president vladimir putin's vision of a shipping lane that rivals the suez and panama canal, but challenges like shallow, ice-filled waters and foggy conditions mean the route has a long way to go before becoming a global sea lane. annual income of cargo transformation through the nrs in russia the country's arctic ambitions are about more than just trade. the region is a cornerstone of its strategy to secure military and economic power. this poses a significant concern for the us and its allies, especially as climate change accelerates ice melt and opens up new access routes. russia's dominance in the arctic could disrupt global trade, heighten geopolitical tensions and undermine us strategic interests.",2
2025-02-07,"while russia boasts dozens of icebreakers, including nuclear-powered vessels, the us is woefully behind. jonathan highlighted that the last heavy polar icebreaker built by the us, the polar star, was commissioned nearly 50 years ago, in 1976. meanwhile, the newer polar security cutter (psc) class of icebreakers, intended to bolster us capabilities, has faced years of delays and budget overruns. number of major icebreakers and ice-capable patrol ships, by country recognizing this, the us has partnered with canada and finland under the ice pact to develop a new generation of icebreakers. finland, which designs 80% of the world's icebreakers, brings valuable expertise to the table. greenland's importance extends beyond its resource wealth. jonathan noted the island occupies a key position along two potential arctic shipping routes – the northwest passage and the transpolar sea route. as sea ice continues to melt, these routes could significantly reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the suez and panama canals. greenland is also home to pituffik space base (formerly thule air base), a critical us military installation for missile early warning and space surveillance. the base's strategic value is compounded by greenland's role in the so-called giuk gap (greenland-iceland-united kingdom) – a naval chokepoint in the north atlantic. investment in pituffik has been inconsistent, however, and its importance has waned since the cold war.",2

2025-02-05,"today, it is a lot more than that – and still rising, at a rate that is quite unpleasant to anyone who gets hungry in manhattan. is there some shortage of hamburgers? or maybe too many people have a job? (economists keep telling us that the solution to ""inflation"" is more unemployment.) no, the reason that hamburgers cost a lot more now is because the dollar lost value during that time – somewhat like the turkish lira has also lost value over the past 20 years, producing terrible chronic inflation in turkey. not as bad, but basically the same thing. already certain measures of ""inflation"" are ticking up, and already economists are getting ready to tell us again that too many people are going to work and making a living. this is stupid – which is why we had to write a book about ""inflation"". (get the new paperback edition, with a new preface.) this is not how we used to do things. for most of united states history, we embraced the principle of stable money – money that is stable in value. this was exemplified by one of the first acts of the new congress, the coinage act of 1792. in that act, it said: ""sec. 19.",1
2025-02-05,"and be it further enacted, that if any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint shall be debased or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less weight or value...every such officer or person who shall commit any or either of the said offences, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death."" if you messed with the value of the dollar, expressed in terms of gold and silver, you got hanged. but today, the value of the dollar goes up and down every day, and mostly down in the longer term. various representatives of the federal reserve bloviate in public about how it is not really their fault. the original principle of 1792, stable money, actually became a cornerstone of us policy for the next 179 years – until the gold standard was effectively ended on august 15, 1971. the united states, just like all decent countries had done for centuries previous, maintained a stable value for their currency by fixing its value to gold and silver, and then, by 1900, to gold alone. in practice, there have always been only two alternatives for currencies: have some kind of floating currency, or fix its value to some external benchmark. today, more than half of all countries fix the value of their currencies to an external benchmark, most commonly the dollar or euro.",1
2025-02-05,"sometimes they are not as successful in this as we would like (their central bankers are as dumb as ours), but nevertheless, that is their policy. this works for smaller countries, but obviously the united states is not going to fix the value of the dollar to the euro or the mexican peso. the only ""external benchmark"" of practical use is gold – just as an assembly of nations memorably decided at the bretton woods conference in 1944. jim grant, one of our best financial historians, has called this ""the gold standard and the phd standard."" the united states did not always stick to its stable money principles. there was a major episode of floating-currency disorder during the civil war, and a number of other more minor incidents. but, as long as the united states stuck to the principle of keeping the value of the currency stable, there was never a problem with ""inflation"". they made it all the way to 1950, with a hamburger that still cost $0.10 – probably not much different than in 1850. i think that americans will get tired, pretty soon, of ever-increasing prices accompanied by ever-increasing blame-avoidance by the economic high priests of the federal reserve or treasury department. but simply being dissatisfied doesn't amount to much. you need a solution. there is only one solution that has always worked: fixing the value of a currency to gold. our noble forefathers consented to hang anyone who messed with the currency.",1

2025-02-03,"however, trump has a thing in his pocket called fiscal (ie, governmental, political) stimulative policy, along with a mandate to use it however he, and the houses of congress he puppeteers, see fit. in other words, the fed could be marginalized in this scenario, leaving our economic fate to a real estate developer used to getting what he wants and used to using credit/debt to get it. it is shaping up as an epic struggle (in my opinion) between the bond market (and by extension, the fed) and government. most administrations, including trump 1, eventually wilt before the great and power fed of oz. but trump 2? is he bluster or is he a force of nature? real or memorex? these are questions we need to take seriously, anticipate correctly and therefore, strategize by. 2025 may not be as simple as a contrarian bear play, although that is still my favored view. von mises wants us to know that there is another option as well. for those who want straight technical analysis and straight answers, please pardon my detour above. but it is how i operate. i cannot in good conscience just issue prognostications without doing and showing the work behind it. the summary of the above is that i have not yet decided for myself which way i firmly believe the 2025 macro will go. i have a favored plan (hat tip once again to the most reliable contrary indicator on the planet, carnival barker extraordinaire, contrarian investing with jim cramer).",0
2025-02-03,"but we must be looking at as many viable possibilities as we can so that we do not operate in a vacuum of bias. i will be right or i will be wrong about the anticipated nearer-term contrarian market liquidation plan, that would come after a perhaps final drive upward in markets. the alternative is an inflationary ""crack up"" that becomes ever more intense, with an absolute bull (in a china shop) at the helm of the economy. in that event, things could appear bullish for longer, but also capital would be in flight, probably aiming for real assets relative to paper (stocks, currency, etc). it's a world of increasingly divisive geopolitics and a big time ""grab"" for these things could be in play. maybe a fitting and climactic end to the age of inflation ondemand, after all.",0

2025-01-31,"by then, it had also become a topic of policy and intellectual debate for chinese and western academics and policymakers, plus a much blunter target for us marketing gurus and 'how to' books to help you exploit these new ""megamarkets"". chindia has since become a romcom movie (set in the usa), and last year it was used against ramesh himself in a row over new delhi kowtowing to beijing! but 2 decades ago, this chimera also proved useful to western investment analysts, especially in precious metals. because while india had long been the no.1 gold consumer nation, china was catching up fast. see where china's private gold demand overtook india? see how that's where it stopped tracking the dollar gold price, too? it leapt most dramatically when chinese households and investors seized on the gold price crash of 2013... ...coincidentally the last time that chinese horoscopes celebrated the year of the snake. let's park that for today. because for gold so far this century, the word chindia meant something important which didn't need nuance or understanding, so long as it kept buying gold. which it did. most of all when the west did not. by weight, private-sector gold demand in the g7 rich-world economies grew or fell together with demand from chindia in only 11 of the past 32 years, barely 1/3rd of the time. across the first half of that period (shown in our first chart above) that figure read 50%, but it sank below 19% in the second half.",0
2025-01-31,"and last year, 2024, was the first time in almost a decade that gold demand among households and investors in both chindia and the g7 grew together. (or so our guesstimates reckon today.) taken apart, in contrast, china and india show strong co-movement in their private gold demand. their purchases have grown or fallen together by weight in 16 of the past 25 years (64% of the time) with barely a break between 1998 and 2007 or 2013 to 2022. by weight, however, china's private-sector gold demand has outrun india every year since the big price crash of 2013. or so the best available data say. on that, please note: demand for jewellery isn't counted the same way as demand for coins, bars or gold etfs. trinket purchases are gross of reselling (ie, scrap) whereas the 'investment' category is net; there isn't any freely available or reliable recycling data for jewellery, not country-by-country. so like the world gold council (who publish the data now gathered and crunched by specialists metals focus we're using above), our charts and analysis lump gross jewellery in with net investment. sorry; all private-sector gold demand in china ultimately starts on the shanghai gold exchange, the only legal route for bullion to enter private circulation. but india's government has no such pinch-point (or stranglehold) and cross-border smuggling makes the true size of private-sector demand ultimately unknowable.",0
2025-01-31,"indeed, smuggling explains how gold prices inside india have consistently run below the global price plus india's import duty and gst sales tax; maybe more importantly, these figures don't include private-sector demand for vaulted gold bullion either. that has almost certainly leapt in china during its real estate, stock market and bank interest rate slump (now entering its 4th year). but it doesn't show up anywhere in hard data; indeed, the gold sitting on commercial bank balance sheets has actually shrunk, most likely because china's financial slump means investors now want to own allocated bullion (such as you buy and sell on bullionvault) rather than holding a mere promise which underwrites the bank, not the investor's portfolio; on top of all this, the numbers and charts above do not include central bank demand. partly that's because we're focusing on private-sector demand, and partly because the 'true' figures for the people's bank are contested and unknowable. very possibly, they account for some of the gap between heavy imports and visible demand. that said, so might china's commercial bank holdings, allocated to 'gold accounts' for chinese investors. and central bank buying might not make much difference to the big picture anyway. remember, the idea of chindia was simple, meaning stupid and blunt. it matched the early 2000s' 'commodity supercycle' or 'brics' marketing spin spun out by goldman sachs, and it enjoyed the same impetus too.",0

""ai is going to be a game of 2 or 3 big companies working closely with the government...we're going to protect them from competition, control them, and dictate what they do."" biden (or his handlers) wanted an ai industry they could control completely. the admin issued ai ""safety"" executive orders designed to limit competition. fortunately, trump has already repealed these eos, but they set us back for 2+ years. in a 2022 effort to contain china's ai advancement, biden cut off the country's access to high-end nvidia gpus, which are (were) the only suitable hardware to build and run ai applications with. these tech sanctions have backfired spectacularly. we cornered china and gave them only one way out: innovation. it appears they have met the challenge. they learned to build cutting-edge ai applications without high-end nvidia gpus. as a result, they can now build models for a tiny fraction of the cost we do.",1

""a world where we don't have to guess and guess and guess their next move, or even listen to what the regional governors are saying, because it won't be that important in the margins."" the above is actually a good point he's making. however, it is not as simple as that. in fact, the bullish implications of trump are the basis of why a contrarian investing opportunity (an opportunity to go the opposite way of the herd and its predominant perceptions) is likely (imo) in development, because trump is so pro-business. the previous administration did all it could to pump the system to new heights of debt and mal-investment. interest rates have lurched back upward on the back of that and the stated policies to come from the trump administration. oh and there's this...the fed still matters. oh yes it does. we'll see the degree to which it matters when trump launches his first volley of verbal bombs at jerome powell. here i disclaim that i too wish we lived in a world without a monetary central planning authority. but i am dealing in the world we have, not a utopian world.",0
2025-01-24,"hearken back to late 2018 when long-term treasury yields were busting upward to test the upper bound of our then resistance limits (monthly ema 100 & 120, now supportive limits) on the continuum (30yr treasury yield) as trump constantly hectored the fed chief to drop the fed funds rate. powell all but ignored him. if history (eg, 2018) repeats, the fed will bow to its true master, the bond market. not its new (would-be) master, trump. back in 2018 trump messed up his timing, because he attacked powell as yields were rising and the fed was following bond market signals. after that came the decline (from the limiters) as was usual during the continuum's decades of trending down. today, the situation is much worse, from a bond market perspective. my view is and has been that no matter trump's pro-business, pro-economy intentions, the macro is stressed to a coming reversal point. maybe after a big time clean-out, trump 2 will take hold to positive economic effect. in other words, there is no denying that deregulation, tax cuts and maybe even some aspects of tariffs would be positive for corporations. the stock market is made up of...corporations. but we are talking interim here. an interim where perceptions are unified in one direction after that direction has already been in play since the 2020 mini-crash. it is in play with a host of negative macro internal conditions and indications. now the play is on a popular tv cartoon show. just sayin'.",0

2025-01-10,"its work with the department of defense has been particularly impactful. major contracts, such as a $480 million deal for its maven smart system and a $401 million follow-on contract for its data-gathering vantage platform, highlight palantir's expanding role in military applications. meanwhile, nvidia benefited immensely from its position as the dominant supplier of graphics processing units. the santa clara-based company – whose technology powers data centers around the globe, with its gpus enabling ai applications and bitcoin mining – generated a jaw-dropping $35 billion in revenue in the third quarter alone as demand for its hardware has soared. as of 6 january 2025, nvidia was the world's second-largest company by market cap, valued at $3.7 trillion. utilities, the lowest-performing s&p 500 sector in 2023, rebounded strongly in 2024, reflecting a major shift in electricity consumption as ai, electrification and decarbonization drive demand. the energy information agency (eia) predicts that global electricity use could rise as much as 75% by 2050. this is good news for providers like vistra and ge vernova, the number two and number four best performing s&p 500 stocks of 2024. vistra, which joined the s&p 500 in may of last year, saw its stock price skyrocket by 261% in 2024. the company's natural gas and nuclear power plants are well-suited to meet the reliability and scalability needs of data centers.",0
2025-01-10,"strategic agreements with cloud computing giants like amazon and microsoft to supply power at premium prices further bolstered its financial performance. ge vernova, general electric's energy spinoff, also saw remarkable growth in 2024, with its stock rising 150% after going public in april. the company's gas turbines have seen strong demand as providers seek to address the growing energy needs of data centers. vernova's involvement in renewable energy projects – such as the $2.75 billion wind energy agreement in australia, signed a year ago – further cements its position as a leader in the sector. the ge spin-off has projected sales of $45 billion in 2028, up from previous estimates of $43 billion. united airlines represented a different investment narrative in 2024: the resurgence of post-pandemic air travel. shares of the chicago-based airline soared 135% last year, marking the carrier's best year ever since going public in 2006. air travel surged in 2024, with the transportation security administration (tsa) reporting screening a combined 900 million+ passengers at us airports, the most on record. united capitalized on this trend in 2024 by operating its largest-ever domestic schedule and greatly expanding international routes. eye-popping passenger volume certainly turned heads, but it was the company's massive $1.5 billion share buyback program, announced in october, that truly boosted investor sentiment.",0
2025-01-10,"on a slightly different note, the correlation between gold and the s&p 500 reached an unprecedented 0.91 in 2024, meaning that the two assets moved in tandem almost 100% of the time throughout the year. gold has historically shared an inverse or low correlation with stocks. that's precisely why many investors favor gold. take a look at the period from the mid-80s to early-90s. gold prices were largely agnostic to what equity prices were doing, making the metal an ideal diversifier. granted, we've also seen periods of sustained positive correlation (check out the entire 2000s decade), but we've never seen such a strong relationship between the two asset classes as we did in 2024. so what gives? first, global central banks have begun a coordinated monetary easing cycle, cutting interest rates to stimulate economic growth. this has created a favorable environment for both stocks (as borrowing costs declined) and gold, which, as a non-yielding asset, has historically thrived when interest rates were low. second, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty have persisted, driving investor demand for safe-haven assets like gold while also supporting equity markets through increased government spending on defense, cybersecurity and infrastructure. third, shifts in asset allocation strategies appear to have played a role.",0

2025-01-08,"trump 2.0 will end today's currency wars article:well, that's the plan apparently... there has been a lot reported in recent days about the return of currency wars, says jim rickards in the daily reckoning. with trump 2.0 about to begin, let's review his last term and what to expect in the second. trump badly bungled his transition after first being elected president in 2016. he was not ready with a long list of loyal appointees. many of his senior appointments such as rex tillerson as secretary of state, james mattis as secretary of defense, and john kelly as chief of staff secretly disliked trump but accepted their roles as so-called ""adult supervision"" around the supposedly reckless trump. they thwarted his agenda. that backstabbing came on top of the large number of obama holdovers in the deep state who saw themselves as a ""resistance"" movement. trump is doing a better job of preparing for a second term as president, but the resistance is not sitting still either. as reported in the washington post, politico, the wall street journal, yahoo finance and other outlets, trump is working on a secret plan to devalue the us dollar. the goal would be to cheapen us exports and thereby help the us balance of trade and create exported-related jobs. but critics say that this will only increase us inflation as americans have to pay more for their imported goods using cheaper dollars.",2
2025-01-08,"the critics also say that other countries will retaliate against the us by cheapening their own currencies (that's the essence of a currency war) and no country will be any further ahead. in fact, the entire world will be worse off. before looking more closely at what's actually going on, some basics about a currency war should be explained. the first rule is that the world is not always in a currency war. the periods from 1944 to 1971 (the original bretton woods era) and from 1987 to 2010 (the period of the washington consensus) were times of currency peace. this contrasts with 1921-1936 (currency war i), 1967-1987 (currency war ii), and the current period since 2010 (currency war iii). the second rule is that when we are in a currency war, they can last for fifteen years or longer. it comes as no surprise that the currency war that commenced in 2010 is still going strong 14 years later in 2024. and that points to another key aspect of this debate. the currency war being written about today by the media is not a new currency war. it's the same one that has been going on since 2010. we're simply in a new phase or a new battle. it is true that cheapening your currency can import inflation. sometimes that's a legitimate policy goal if your country has been suffering from deflation. that's obviously not the case in the us today. it's also true that cheapening your currency can export deflation as trading partners pay less for your goods.",2
2025-01-08,"that's what china was doing to the entire world from 1994 to 2010 and that's why the us launched a currency war in 2010 – to fight back against disinflation and borderline deflation caused by cheap chinese goods. currency wars can also shift jobs overseas and destroy domestic manufacturing as the terms of trade shift based on changing currency values. retaliation is always waiting right around the corner in any currency war. the us dollar hit an all-time low in august 2011, which was consistent with the us goal of trying to import inflation. but europe struck back, and the eur/usd cross-rate crashed from $1.60 to $1.04 as a result. so, it is correct that no one wins a currency war, and everyone is damaged in the process due to volatility, uncertainty, and the costs of conducting the war. so, are the critics right that trump has a secret plan to devalue the dollar? and are they right that this new stage in the currency war will bring inflation and hurt the us economy? the critics are wrong and don't understand what trump is actually trying to do. trump is not trying to start a currency war; he's trying to end it once and for all. in the first place, no president has the power to unilaterally devalue the dollar. that might have been possible under the gold standard or some standard of fixed exchange rates, but that has not been the state of the world since 1973.",2
2025-01-08,"exchange rates fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates, industrial growth, exchange controls, central bank interventions, capital flows, tax rates and many other macroeconomic variables. but the idea that the president can just wave his hand and devalue the dollar is false. far from the reckless, inflationary process the media claim, trump's actual plan is based on the highly successful model developed by james baker for ronald reagan and implemented in the plaza accord of 1985 and the louvre accord of 1987. after the severe economic recession of 1982 and paul volcker's policy of moving interest rates to 20%, inflation in the us was finally reigned in. inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980, to 6.1% in 1982, and then 3.2% in 1983. investment in the us went on a tear. us real growth was 16% from 1983 to 1986. everyone wanted dollars to invest in the us and the dollar boomed reaching an all-time high in 1985. finally, the reagan administration decided the us dollar was too strong and was hurting us exports and jobs. treasury secretary james baker convened a meeting of the finance ministers of france, germany, japan, the uk, and the us at the plaza hotel in new york city. the purpose was not to fight a currency war. the purpose was to create order in currency markets out of the chaos that had prevailed since 1973.",2
2025-01-08,"the parties reached a joint agreement that would devalue the us dollar in an orderly fashion versus the french franc, japanese yen, uk pound sterling, and the german deutschemark. once the targeted level for the dollar was achieved, the parties would use their best efforts, including market intervention as needed to maintain those levels within narrow bands. a separate meeting in paris at the louvre in 1987 agreed that the devaluation phase was over, and the dollar would be maintained at the new parities. this was not currency war; it was currency peace achieved by agreement and implemented in a cooperative fashion. the louvre accord (this time including the us, uk, france, germany, japan and canada) ushered in a period of global prosperity that lasted twenty years until the global financial crisis of 2008. trump's goal is to repeat the success of the plaza and louvre accords. trump's advisor on this is robert lighthizer, who is one of the most brilliant financial minds around and was trump's us trade representative (2017-2021). lighthizer was also ustr for ronald reagan from 1983 to 1985 so he's a veteran of prior currency wars and was in the administration around the time the plaza accord was being developed. lighthizer is the perfect individual to help trump achieve the kind of success that reagan and baker had in the 1980s. the media are trying to portray trump as reckless when in fact he's proposing something highly beneficial for us jobs and us industry.",2

2025-01-07,"but that calm now looks fragile as 2025 begins, and trump's victory in the us election has driven a surge in first-time buyers, particularly across europe. the number of first-time bullionvault users worldwide rose 42.4% last year to the most since 2021, almost half of them opening their account in the last 4 months. of those, more than 60% live in the uk, germany or france. the silver investor index also fell in december, dropping 1.3 points from november's 21-month high to read 52.7. that put the index's 2024 average at 50.8, matching the prior year's series low. by weight, investors were net buyers of silver for the second month running, adding 1.9 tonnes and taking bullionvault client holdings 0.2% higher to the most since september at 1,156 tonnes. but the retreat in silver prices meant that gave the lowest value since july at $1.1bn, down 11.5% from october's record (-8.9% in gbp from £954m, -8.0% in eur from more than €1.1bn, -9.0% in jpy from ¥189bn). gold meanwhile returned to net selling after november's steep price drop snapped a 14-month run of profit-taking, but with bullionvault users selling only 45 kilograms more gold than they bought as a group.",0

2024-12-30,"such happy thoughts come after 2024 proved a remarkable year for gold, topping a stellar quarter-century during which the precious metal has beaten the return from all other assets, even the us stock market. while surging demand from households in china and india has supported this move, the switch into gold by private investors and more recently central banks has driven the precious metal to new all-time highs in terms of all currencies. nearer to hand, the no.1 driver of precious metals prices in the coming 12 months will be geopolitics according to almost a third of bullionvault users (31.4%). that's seen it overtake monetary policy (down at 16.8%) in bullionvault's new year survey for the first time since 2022. in fact, concerns over the size of government budget deficits and debt come next, polling one-in-five responses (20.8%) and moving up to second place for the first new year survey in four. the impact on gold prices? the price of gold has risen by 26.4% this year in terms of the us dollar, its 18th annual gain of the 21st century to date and its strongest rise since 2007. respondents to bullionvault's survey last december forecast that gold would reach $2342 this christmas. although 10.1% shy of the current price of $2606, that was much closer than consensus forecasts from bullion-market professionals. what's more, bullionvault users then raised their year-end forecast to $2583 in our july survey.",2
2024-12-30,"that's less than 0.9% off today's current level, a remarkable win as the best gold price forecaster. looking ahead, bullionvault's latest survey now forecasts a gold price of $3070 per troy ounce at the end of 2025, an increase of 17.8% from today's level. our survey finds even greater confidence in silver, forecasting an end-2025 price of $36.80 with a projected increase of 26.9% from today. that might sound dramatic...and the past doesn't promise the future of course. but the more industrially useful precious metal this year recorded its 15th annual rise since millennium eve, gaining 21.9%, hitting a run of 13-year highs, and spurring a mid-year hike to investor forecasts to say that silver would trade at nearly $34.50 per ounce by this new year's eve. that $5 over-estimate shows how big gains can invite big expectations, and that can invite disappointment. because again, the past is no guide to the future as regulators and other spoilsports repeatedly claim. to be sure, the turnaround in gold and silver's fortunes so far this century shows how investment trends come and go. twenty-five years ago, gold in particular was lost in the investment wilderness... ...unwanted by central banks, unloved by investors, and struggling to find demand from its big consumer markets following the asian crisis. the positive shocks from the turnaround in those factors all now lie in the past. they cannot be repeated.",2
2024-12-30,"but the key trends driving gold prices upwards since the millennium look set to continue, at least for the near-term. and beyond that, geopolitics and worsening government debt will then drive gold and silver higher next year before continuing to harry and harrow the financial markets through to mid-century. or so the latest survey of the world's largest pool of active precious metals investors predicts. let's see what 2025 brings.",2

2024-12-19,"gold vanished from hand-to-hand money in the 1930s, it vanished from backing most countries' money by the 1950s, and it was finally cut from backing the united states' almighty post-war dollar (and therefore from the rest of the world's money) in the early 1970s. a quarter-century later, that left very few central bankers with a memory of gold as a monetary asset, let alone a love for it. so as the millennium drew near, european and other western nations were selling gold, while asian and other 'emerging' nations were too busy fighting currency-and-debt crises of their own to spare any cash on what no one else wanted. but this marked an extreme, not a new normal. and starting from there... ...and after the gold price finally found a floor and turned higher in the early 2000s... ...global selling flipped into strong net demand from central banks when the 'global' financial crisis hit western economies. why? no one sells safe-haven gold during a crisis (not outside the ultimate crisis). so western central banks stopped dumping it. just as importantly, the gfc saw interest rates on dollars, euros, yen and sterling collapse... ...down to zero and even below it. that forced emerging nations (who now had much bigger reserve-asset stockpiles to defend thanks to globalization sending them huge piles of western currency to pay for huge piles of energy and cut-price manufactured goods) to spread their risk with a better store of value than the big reserve currencies now offered.",0
2024-12-19,"result? the strongest run of central-bank gold buying since the height of the interwar gold standard rush, plus the highest gold prices in history. okay, okay. but what else is the no.1 reason for gold's big 21st century bull market? #1 gold driver no.2: gold etfs the boom in investment access to gold can't be understated. it was 20 years ago last month that the giant gld gold etf was launched onto the new york stock market. the gld still accounts for a quarter of total gold etf holdings worldwide, albeit down from 2/3rds during the global financial crisis. and back in 2004, it enabled us investors to do what a couple of trusts already let aussie and uk investors do: track the price of gold without owning the metal. yes, gold etfs are backed by gold to give their stock-market shares value. and that link meant that, pretty soon, the quantity of gold held to back etfs also tracked the price. or vice versa. either way, etf demand has shown a strong and clear connection with the direction of bullion. tangible assets are something which us fund managers in particular can't bear, because they can usually hold only securitized investments in their portfolios, not physical stuff.",0
2024-12-19,"prior to the etfs, that meant big money either had to buy gold futures or options contracts... ...buying leveraged risk and paying costly derivatives fees to get gold-price exposure... ...or they had to buy gold mining shares, which are not the metal but carry management, equity, political and a host of other risks instead. so it was – ironically – the same rush of innovation which gave the early 2000s such toxic assets as subprime mortgage cds and the lethal cdo-squared that gave investors wanting a hedge for all that risk the chance to trade a gold-backed etf... ...a stock-market quoted, gold-denominated debt security which is the obligation of a trust created for the specific purpose of enabling gold investment through it. got all that? simple folk wanting simple ownership might prefer simpler access. and they also got new gold products in the early 21st century too. yes, market-leader bullionvault, of course... ...now used by over 110,000 people worldwide to invest directly in physical precious metals, and now caring for $5 billion of precious metals for those users today. there was also a rash of new coin shops and e-tailers, all rushing to fill the gap which old-school dealers (including your local bank branch) had vacated during gold's long bear market between its 1980 top and the year 2000. but for the big money, especially money that didn't care so much about owning any gold, it was etfs which revolutionized how fund managers could get into the metal.",0
2024-12-19,"and that access soon meant the size of etfs showed a remarkable link with the price of bullion. between 2004 and 2022 in fact, their 12-month correlation averaged +0.84... ...a number which would read +1.00 if they moved exactly in lockstep, or -1.00 if they moved exactly opposite. but as our chart shows, this strong relationship between gold prices and gold etfs broke down around russia’s invasion of ukraine... ...because while western sanctions against moscow drove central banks to seek yet more safety in gold, helping support and raise prices, western money managers just didn’t feel the fear, cutting their holdings and taking profit instead (as did private bullion investors on russia's all-out invasion too.) this break between etf flows and gold prices then continued as china’s miserable real-estate and stock-market performance spurred a surge of private chinese demand this spring. more on that another day. because china really matters. so does india. for now, let's not forget what brings our first two number 1 gold-price drivers together. #1 gold driver no.3: fear and loathing the dotcom crash, 9/11, iraq's wmds, katrina, 7/7, subprime, northern rock, lehmans, the mumbai attacks, eurozone crisis... ...the first decade of the 21st century pulled the rug from under public confidence in both government and markets.",0
2024-12-19,"doubt and fear then only deepened during the covid pandemic, the following surge of inflation, russia's invasion of ukraine, hamas' attack on israel, the flattening of gaza, russia 'testing' nuclear-capable missiles, and the ever-growing warnings about how western government debts (and therefore spending) are simply unsustainable. instead of enjoying ' the end of history', the world has been living through what can feel more like ' the end times'. which is ironic, given the contrast between the giant parties thrown to mark what was popularly known as the millennium and the 'millennial' end-of-the-world seen in some biblical readings. either way, risks unseen and unknown have come to threaten everyone's savings and safety, no matter how cautious. maybe a lump of uninflatable, indestructible, undefaultable value would help? it has certainly worked out that way for gold so far this century.",0
2024-12-16,"trump vs. the 'deep state' fed article:economy weak, fed pushback strong... ""not permitted under the law,"" snapped jay powell, writes dan amoss in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. the scene was the fed's press conference. it was the day after donald trump's resounding election victory. the reporter, seeking confirmation, followed up. ""not per-mit-ted under the law!"" repeated a visibly irritated powell, slowly enunciating the word. powell's body language said he's ready to battle trump in the press. i recount this scene to give you a head start in identifying one of trump's next battles in his multi-year conflict with the deep state. starting in 2017, the deep state tried to impeach trump, undermine his policy goals, slow-walk his orders to the military, and ruin the 2020 economy with covid lockdowns. most controversially, it's hard to argue that the deep state didn't inspire the mysterious shooter whose bullet grazed trump's ear at a fateful july 2024 rally in butler, pennsylvania. you, me, and the entire world are wondering, ""what will they do next?"" by ""they,"" i am not referring to a pre-planned conspiracy. there is no single evil mastermind running the deep state – one who has anticipated every possible countermove. no, the deep state is a faceless blob. it is a group of government agencies, media outlets, corporations, and people inside those organizations. they understand that trump's vision for america is disruptive to their preferred way of doing business.",0
2024-12-16,"rather than adapt to trump's priorities, they see it as a sacred duty to resist him. let's return to the role of fed chairman jay powell. powell is trying to serve the american public as best he can, even if he's blind to the fed's role in promoting wealth inequality and inflation. powell's policies have been too soft on asset owners in our overly financialized us economy. the fed's asset-pumping policies have exacerbated the wealth gap. it eased policy far too much with trillions of dollars in money printing and its tightening in 2022 and 2023 has not been nearly so dramatic. the wealth gap, powered by the residual money printed in 2021 and 2022, has played a key role in resurrecting trump's campaign. trump started from a small base of loyal family members and friends on january 6, 2021, rode a tidal wave of public discontent over rampant biden inflation, and won the popular vote. the remarkable rebound in support for trump over three years could not have happened if most americans were happy with the status quo under biden. we know where most of the american public stands. they are financially worn out and frustrated by the pain of cumulative inflation. their confidence is low, but many are hopeful that trump will turn things around quickly. however, turning around this economic ship will not be easy, nor will it be costless. the economy is like a large ship that's been heading in a specific direction.",0
2024-12-16,"even if trump steers it sharply in a different, more production-oriented direction, it will take time to see material results. meanwhile, biden's advisors have for years been steering the economic ship in the direction of bloated government spending, government jobs, and malinvestment in green energy. i think it's important to keep this in mind when thinking about trump's goals starting in 2025: there is a global imbalance between production and consumption, and it's been growing for decades. i support trump's vision to reprioritize production in america. our multi-decade trend toward over-consuming with too many government jobs and service jobs is unhealthy and unstable. we've done this while exporting bonds and stocks to foreign producers to fund this consumption. bonds and stocks are securities with explicit or implicit promises to deliver streams of cash flow. bonds are explicit, pre-defined streams of cash flow. stocks are implicit promises of future cash flow in the form of dividends. here's why stocks are so volatile: it's difficult – even for diligent professionals – to estimate how large and sustainable their dividends will be for decades into the future. in an all-too-common example, a company that goes bankrupt within a few years of an investor buying its stock rarely pays enough dividends for that investor to recoup his investment in that stock before it goes to zero.",0
2024-12-16,"with that context established, i'll say this: achieving trump's vision to reprioritize production in america will involve pain for an economy with an unhealthy addiction to bubbly asset prices. there is no easy path to revitalizing american manufacturing. compromises will be required either way. the fact is, the pain from restructuring a bloated federal government means the risk of a recession is high. and when recession risks rise, the fed slashes rates and gold typically surges higher.",0
2024-12-13,"will tariffs trigger inflation? article:here's what investors should know... as families gathered to celebrate thanksgiving last month, there was a morsel of good news for consumers, writes frank holmes at us global investors. the cost of the traditional feast fell for the second year in a row. a classic turkey day dinner for 10 cost $58.08, down 5% from last year, according to the american farm bureau federation's (afbf) annual survey. that should come as welcome relief, but before we raise a toast to declining prices, keep in mind that costs are still nearly 20% higher than they were just five years ago. could we be on the cusp of another wave of rising costs? if president-elect donald trump's proposed tariffs on imports from china, mexico and other key trade partners come to fruition, the answer may well be yes. history teaches us that tariffs – while well-intentioned as tools for protectionist policies – tend to raise consumer prices. and the american dinner table may once again feel the squeeze. among trump's proposals is a sweeping 60% tariff on all goods imported from china and a 25%-tariff on goods from mexico and canada. the tariffs will remain on mexican and canadian goods until the two countries crack down on their ""ridiculous open borders,"" trump says. most economists agree that these policies, if enacted, would result in higher costs for us consumers.",1
2024-12-13,"after all, tariffs are essentially taxes on imports, and the importing businesses typically pass those costs on to the end consumer. the size of the impact would depend on the specifics. a hypothetical 10% tariff on all goods entering the us would increase overall prices by an estimated 1.3% annually, according to ubs. selective tariffs targeting specific goods or countries could be even more disruptive, especially if supply chains can't adjust quickly enough to avoid the additional costs. consider the washing machine tariffs imposed during trump's first term. from february to may 2018, the price of laundry equipment in the us rose a massive 16.4% – the largest three-month price jump in 40 years of bureau of labor statistics (bls) data. twelve months after the tariffs were in place, americans were paying roughly $100 more per washing machine and dryer. similarly, the broader trade war with china raised costs for everything from electronics to furniture, adding an estimated $3.2 billion per month in additional taxes for american consumers. the same could happen again, but on an even more dramatic scale. under trump's trade policies, a pair of $80 jeans could cost between $10 and $16 extra, while a $50 tricycle could cost an additional $18-$28 more, according to a new report by the national retail federation (nrf). trump's proposed tariffs have significant implications for much more than just thanksgiving dinners.",1
2024-12-13,"if you believe tariffs are going to drive up prices on imported goods, consider stocking up now on items likely to be affected: toys, household appliances, apparel and even travel goods. investors should watch this space closely. industries with lots of exposure to imported goods – retail, electronics and even agriculture – could face significant headwinds. china, mexico and canada are three of the us's largest trading partners, and disrupting these relationships could lead to ripple effects across commodities markets, manufacturing and technology sectors. on the other hand, companies that produce goods domestically or operate in sectors less sensitive to global trade could find opportunities in a high-tariff climate. us manufacturers that compete with imports could see increased demand due to higher prices on foreign alternatives. among steel producers, for instance, think nucor or us steel. higher material costs could also encourage more recycling, potentially boosting profits for scrap metal firms such as radius recycling (formerly schnitzer steel industries) and steel dynamics. trump's tariff proposals will likely dominate headlines in the new year. whether they are implemented in full, selectively or through compromise remains to be seen. what should be clear, though, is that these policies will carry costs – not just for consumers but for the economy as a whole. at us global investors, we're keeping a close eye on these developments.",1

2024-12-11,"hey, loser! how to win at investing article:diversification as portfolio protection... a question for you, says tim price at price value partners. in the context of your savings and investments, do you want to be a winner, or do you want to avoid being a loser? an awful lot hangs on your response. peter bernstein's book 'against the gods' is not just recommended but compulsory reading for investors who are interested in the broader history of risk. one of the defining moments of our career was stumbling on the advice offered within it by the 'renaissance man' polymath daniel bernoulli. bernoulli offered the following counsel to those involved in managing the wealth of others: ""the practical utility of any gain in portfolio value inversely relates to the size of the portfolio."" in other words, as a general rule, the more people have, the less they need by way of subsequent return. or to put it another way, in terms that have been validated by the work of nobel laureates after bernoulli, wealthy people should be more concerned with capital preservation – in real terms, of course – than with future capital growth. 'wealthy' is clearly a somewhat subjective term, but we can all relate to the concept of keeping what you have versus putting all of it at risk. this capital preservation approach is all the more important when it relates to those investors who no longer receive regular income by way of paid employment.",2
2024-12-11,"that is to say, it's especially relevant for retirees and pensioners, who have pots of sacred assets that simply cannot be replaced. one of the reasons that bernoulli's advice made such an impact on us was that we came across it during the first dotcom bubble, i.e. the period in the late 1990s through to early 2000 and the nasdaq bust. at the time, everybody seemed to be amassing huge wealth, quickly, through the ownership of speculative internet stocks. in the words of lord overstone, ""no warning on earth can save people determined to grow suddenly rich."" we suspect that you can pretty much boil the entire stock market down into two fundamental types of participants: those who want to beat the market (or who at least express their performance in market-relative terms) and those, like ourselves, who want to generate a decent absolute return but who don't want to share in the market's inevitable drawdowns at a ratio of 1:1 when they occur. in other words, our own investment objective is to try and secure as much of the upside potential available through the stock market whilst at the same time trying to protect the downside as far as practicable. the problem with the aspiration to 'win at all costs' (i.e. to beat the market by a meaningful margin) is two-fold.",2
2024-12-11,"firstly, it's extraordinarily difficult (though not impossible – warren buffett, benjamin graham and the superinvestors of graham and doddsville did actually exist); secondly, you have to accept that in trying to beat the market, by taking more risk than the market, you also run the risk of losing more than the market when things go south. that's not a risk we're willing to take with our own money, and it's not a risk we're willing to take, at least consciously, with that of our clients. how bad can underperformance relative to the market be? consider the drawdown incurred by us equity investors who owned the market in the form of the dow jones industrial average after the great crash of 1929. in the first instance, the drawdown they suffered between 1929 and 1932 equated to one of 89%. secondly, us equity investors who owned ""the market"" at its peak in 1929 weren't made whole again in real terms until 1954. they had to wait 26 years just to get their money back – assuming that they didn't panic and sell out in desperation at the low, which many of them likely did. if this sounds bad, and it clearly is, now consider how expensive the us stock market is today.",2
2024-12-11,"robert shiller's cyclically adjusted (i.e. smoothed over the course of a prior decade to take account of the vagaries of the volatility in short-term corporate earnings) price / earnings ratio for the s&p 500 index – more representative of the entire us economy than that of the 30-stock dow – now stands at roughly 37 times, or more expensive than it was in 1929 and only lower than its prevailing level during the first dotcom bubble. its long run average for the past 150 years is roughly 17 times. we are at more than twice that level today. the late 1990s showed us that the shiller p/e can remain unnaturally elevated for a while. and we're not in denial about the 'new economy' and the capital-light model that can be exploited in some cases to achieve global scale quickly by digital businesses (though it turns out ai is fantastically and expensively energy-intensive). our point is somewhat subtler: we don't think that human nature quickly changes. and we believe in reversion to the mean. interest rates have started to rise over the past couple of years after three-and-a-half decades of trending down towards zero. most fund managers have never experienced a higher interest rate cycle. so we make no apology for focusing on a 'safety first' approach towards managing your investments.",2
2024-12-11,"our focus is and will always be on capital preservation as much as on future capital growth, and we define capital preservation as primarily a focus on defensive value with some form of margin of safety. you can try and be a winner, and put a significant part of your savings pot at risk. or you can try not to be a loser, and focus on an absolute return (cash-plus or inflation-plus) objective instead. our thesis is that over the long run, by avoiding the big drawdowns consistent with market-relative investing, we may well end up beating the market anyway – by preserving more capital during the downturns than index-relative investors do. it then becomes a matter of compounding at an overall higher rate, because we manage to avoid some of the wrenching and inevitable losses that occur during bear markets, and from which it can be sometimes very difficult ever to recover. the post-1929 experience being a case in point. there are some specific aspects to our 'not losing' thesis. one is that a properly diversified investment portfolio in 2024 should include 'value' equities (shares in cheap but high quality listed businesses); systematic trend-following funds (uncorrelated to stock and bond markets); and real assets, notably the monetary metals, gold and silver, and related investments trading, again, cheaply versus their historic range. why 'value' equities?",2
2024-12-11,"because common stocks have, over the last two centuries, been one of the best-performing assets to own, at least in the context of the us and uk markets. other regions haven't been so lucky. the refinement is then to concentrate primarily on 'value' stocks – i.e. shares of high quality businesses run by principled, shareholder-friendly management with a track record of generating strong shareholder returns, but only when those shares can be bought at a meaningful discount to their inherent value. why systematic trend-following funds? the investment world has got more risky, not less, since the global financial crisis. global politics are a mess, and a rising interest rate cycle will play merry hell with traditional portfolios, and not least with bonds. managers pursuing an unconstrained (long and short) diversified trading thesis will be more appropriate than plodding index-trackers. the time to use index-trackers will be after the next major correction, when markets are once again objectively cheap. why 'real assets' and the monetary metals? because we believe in sound money. gold and silver have always been ""money good"" – nobody has ever been forced to use them as money; their use arose spontaneously in free markets and economies over thousands of years. governments today have to use the rule of law and coercion to get us to pay our taxes (and pretty much everything else) in fiat currency.",2
2024-12-11,"given the extent to which the debt markets have continued to expand since 2008, we suspect that the next phase in this rolling financial predicament will be highly inflationary, as governments continue to prime the monetary pump to avoid a gigantic reset (which may come anyway). gold and silver, of course, cannot be printed. as mohamed el-erian points out in 'the financial times' ('why the west should be paying more attention to the gold price', 21 october 2024): ""gold's 'all-weather' characteristic signals something that goes beyond economics, politics and higher-frequency geopolitical developments. it captures an increasingly persistent behavioural trend among china and ""middle power"" countries, as well as others. ""over the past 12 months, the price of an ounce of gold on international markets has increased from $1947 to $2715, a gain of almost 40 per cent. interestingly, this march up in price has been relatively linear, with any pullback attracting more buyers. it has occurred despite some wild swings in expected policy rates, a wide fluctuation band for benchmark us yields, falling inflation and currency volatility. ""what is at stake here is not just the erosion of the dollar's dominant role but also a gradual change in the operation of the global system. no other currency or payment system is able and willing to displace the dollar at the core of the system and there is a practical limit to reserve diversification.",2
2024-12-11,"but an increasing number of little pipes are being built to go around this core; and a growing number of countries are interested and increasingly involved. ""what has been happening to the gold price is not just unusual in terms of traditional economic and financial influences. it also goes beyond strict geopolitical influences to capture a broader phenomenon which is building secular momentum. ""as it develops deeper roots, this risks materially fragmenting the global system and eroding the international influence of the dollar and the us financial system. that would have an impact on the us's ability to inform and influence outcomes, and undermine its national security. it is a phenomenon that western governments should pay more attention to."" there is one crucial caveat to this diversified and 'value' approach, however. it requires patience – especially with regard to the 'value' equity component. would you have sold? that caveat about requiring patience, though, bears repeating. perhaps the best way of expressing it is via the 1970s performance of berkshire hathaway stock – one of the best performing us equity investments of the last 50 years – versus the market. the data below shows you how you would have fared if you'd put $10,000 into shares of berkshire hathaway and $10,000 into the s&p 500 stock index in 1971. it tells something of a story. the figures should speak for themselves.",2
2024-12-11,"warren buffett is a multi-billionaire because of this long-term outperformance of the market. but in 1971, you didn't know what the future would hold. what you did experience, by holding berkshire hathaway until 1975, was losing half of your money, even while the rest of the market recovered, and 4 years of dismal returns. simple question. in the light of just those four years of data alone, what do you honestly think you would have done? would you have sold? which is why it's crucial to take the long view. markets are not entirely efficient, nor are they entirely rational. what matters to us, as shareholders in any company, is how the company is performing at an operational level. is it still making decent profits? is it still using its cash wisely? for as long as the company is operating decently or better, we try not to care too much about the stock price. the company can control its profits (more or less) but it can do next to nothing about controlling its stock price. that is almost entirely in the hands of the mob. no matter how much money you have and no matter how smart you are, there are only so many things you can do to protect your financial future. there is always something that can catch you unawares. there is also a pervasive sense among the electorates of the west that they have somehow been cheated by the forces of 'crony capitalism' – and we share that resentment.",2

""i think many of us were surprised during covid to realize just what the supposedly liberal west has become: essentially the soviet union but with better uniforms."" the politics of our time have now become hopelessly polarised and admit, seemingly, to no compromise on anything. that leaves the very real threat of an ultimately undelivered brexit and – almost infinitely worse still – the threat of unreconstructed marxist governments across the supposedly developed world. so the real impact of the global financial crisis has only just started to be felt at a social level. this is in part what happens when governments fail to address major problems in a serious way, the first time around.",2
2024-12-11,"in a justly famous essay, charles 'charley' ellis, the investment consultant who founded greenwich associates, pointed out, citing the work of scientist simon ramo in the process, that there was not in fact one game of tennis, but two. there was tennis as played by the professionals, and then tennis as played by the rest of us. in the professional game, the player wins points. in the amateur game, the player loses points. professional tennis players are a dream to watch, as they vault, dive, lunge and volley. they rarely make errors. amateur tennis players: not so much. the tennis pro is playing a winner's game. victory is down to winning more points than your opponent. the amateur is playing a loser's game. victory is achieved, and not very stylishly, by getting a higher score than your opponent, because he or she loses more points than you do. amateur tennis is a game full of errors. ramo even tallied the scores. the verdict: in professional tennis, about 80 percent of the points are won. in amateur tennis, roughly 80 percent of the points are lost, i.e. in unforced errors. for the amateur tennis player, the best strategy for victory is to avoid mistakes. the best way to avoid mistakes is to be conservative and keep the ball in play. give the other player enough rope to hang himself. clearly the analogy is useful for the private investor versus the alleged professional.",2
2024-12-11,"although human nature doesn't change, the composition of the financial markets has evidently changed over the past century. ellis suggests that during the 1930s and 1940s – a period during which the work of the value investor benjamin graham would come to growing prominence – preservation of capital and prudent investment approaches would come to dominate. the bull market of the 1950s attracted new types of aggressive, hot money investors. the people who were drawn to the wall street of the 1960s had always been winners – in debating teams or in sports teams. but as the markets sucked in more and more winners and people who urgently wanted to win, the dynamic of the markets changed. in the 10 years prior to ellis' 1975 essay, institutional investors went from representing 30 percent of the turnover on wall street to 70 percent. ellis' advice to anyone trying to beat the professionals at their own game? know your investment policies very well and play according to them consistently. let the other fellow make the mistakes. let him track the benchmarks – leave your own portfolio entirely unconstrained. keep it simple. in the words of the golfer tommy armour, ""play the shot you've got the greatest chance of playing well."" wait for the fat pitch. do nothing otherwise. this is a luxury the institutional fund manager does not have. focus on defence. in a loser's game, researchers should spend most of their time making sell decisions, not purchases.",2
2024-12-11,"to put it another way, limit your number of purchases. better a concentrated portfolio where each of the positions is well understood, than a 'diworsified' portfolio consisting of little or no underlying investment conviction. data strongly suggest that the optimal number of portfolio holdings is around 16 or so.

""most of the people in the investment business are ""winners"" who have won all their lives by being bright, articulate, disciplined and willing to work hard. they are so accustomed to succeeding by trying harder and are so used to believing that failure to succeed is the failure's own fault that they may take it personally when they see that the average professionally managed fund cannot keep pace with the market.."" you don't have to worry about peer group performance. there's no rush – you just need to shepherd your capital so that you can stay in the game. value investing gives you an automatic edge over most market professionals because it's a game very few of them can even play. they don't have the luxury of time, and they don't have the flexibility to go off benchmark and invest freely into the best opportunities.",2

2024-12-01,"gold says silver's cheap article:ratio out of historical whack... in 2023 global silver production was approximately 26,000 metric tons, writes adam sharp in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. during the same period, gold production was around 3,000 tonnes. so 8.6x more silver is mined annually than gold. yet gold trades at about 86x the price of silver today ($2633/oz for gold and $30.60/oz for silver). what explains this disconnect? the primary differentiator is the fact that central banks buy and hold large quantities of gold. global central banks and governments hold approximately 36,700 tons, or roughly 17% of all gold ever mined. it doesn't really seem like that much – just 17%. but that percentage makes a world of difference in markets. even single-digit moves in supply/demand can dramatically impact hard asset prices. when central banks hold nearly a fifth of global supply and are buying more, that matters greatly. gold remains a monetary asset today, and i believe there's a good chance we return to some version of the gold standard in the future. silver, on the other hand, has lost its monetary mojo (for now). yet historically, both gold and silver were money. take a look at this infographic which shows the gold/silver ratio at various points in history. as you can see, the historical ratios were more proportional to the relative scarcity of these precious metals in the ground (roughly 1:8 today).",0
2024-12-01,"for much of history, gold was used for large purchases such as real estate, and silver for everyday expenses. even up until 1964 in the us, silver was an important part of our coinage. i believe that eventually, silver will also re-emerge as a personal monetary asset. individual investors will catch on that we're headed for a financial reset. they will want to put their money into something analog. a hard asset that can't be hacked. but some people want something with more upside than gold, while still offering the safety of precious metals. silver fits the bill beautifully. today, demand for silver is once again booming, but not for monetary purposes (yet). as we can see in the latest silver institute report, physical investment demand for silver is currently dropping. physical investment is forecast to fall by 15% to a four-year low of 208moz in 2024. losses have been concentrating in the us where coin and bar sales are on track for a 40% decline to its lowest level since 2019. this reflects an absence of new crises during 2024-to-date, which has affected precious metal retail investment across the board. industrial demand, however, is still soaring. in 2024 industrial buying is set to rise 7%, primarily driven by solar panel growth in china. etf demand is also rising, reflecting growing investor interest in that area. it's set to rise 8% vs 2023, the first inflow in years. this is a good sign.",0

2024-11-21,"military and cyber security investing jumps article:usa makes 40% of global defense spending... with president-elect donald trump set to assume office in january, the us military and cybersecurity sectors could experience sweeping changes, creating opportunities for investors who recognize the long-term growth potential in defense and technology, writes frank holmes at us global investors. in his first term, president trump left his mark on the us military, establishing the space force and boosting defense spending to historic highs. now, as he prepares for his second term, his administration's ambitious goals – such as potentially creating an iron dome missile defense shield system – signal a renewed focus on military modernization. meanwhile, cyber threats have reached an all-time high, requiring unprecedented investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. for investors, these trends highlight two critical sectors poised for growth: traditional defense and the emerging field of cyber defense. in 2023, us military expenditure reached $916 billion, representing a staggering 40% of global military spending. as i shared with you earlier in the year, that's more than the next 10 countries combined. despite this eye-popping figure, us defense spending as a share of gdp has been falling steadily for decades and recently hit an historic low, a function of the us economy growing faster than military spending.",2
2024-11-21,"i believe this highlights an important point: while the us spends more on defense than any other nation, there's still room for growth, particularly as new threats emerge on both physical and virtual battlefields. the congressional budget office (cbo) projects that military spending will increase 10% between 2028 and 2038, adjusted for inflation. but republicans could accelerate this timeline, with bold initiatives like the proposed iron dome-style missile defense system. the potential for increased defense budgets isn't limited to the us nato allies, under renewed pressure from an incoming trump administration, are likely to ramp up their own spending. germany, for example, has already met nato's 2% gdp defense target for the first time in decades, and public opinion now supports raising it even further to between 3% and 3.5%. poland currently leads the alliance by spending a whopping 4.12% of gdp on defense, and next year, that figure is expected to rise to 5%. while traditional military spending captures the headlines, the cybersecurity sector represents an equally important – and arguably more urgent, i think – investment opportunity. recent data by check point software technologies reveals that cyberattacks have skyrocketed, with the average number of weekly attacks climbing 75% globally year-over-year, to hit a record high of 1,876 per organization. in the us, attacks are up 56% from 2023 levels, averaging 1,300 per organization weekly.",2
2024-11-21,"the culprits aren't just rogue hackers but state-sponsored actors from powerful nations like china, russia and iran, according to microsoft's digital defense report 2024. these adversaries are no longer content with merely breaching corporate networks. they target critical infrastructure, telecommunications and even political figures. a recent campaign by chinese state-sponsored hackers infiltrated the phones of trump, vice president-elect jd vance and vice president kamala harris, underscoring the growing national security implications of these attacks. as businesses, governments and individuals race to protect themselves from these threats, the need for robust cybersecurity will only increase. for investors, this means that companies developing cutting-edge technology to secure networks and data could be positioned for explosive growth. defense and cybersecurity budgets tend to receive bipartisan support, but trump's return could supercharge growth. his track record – and his recent, controversial nomination of fox news host pete hegseth as defense secretary – suggests a willingness to take bold steps to reshape the us military and strengthen the nation's defenses against 21st-century threats. as we look ahead to 2024 and beyond, it's clear that military and cybersecurity spending are on an upward trajectory.",2

2024-11-19,"trading the melt-up? pros take profit article:how to trade stock-market surge into 2025... the sharp election rally has given way to some volatility as investors digest the moves, fill some gaps, and nervously wait to see what stocks and sectors bounce first, says greg guenther in the daily reckoning. it's easy to start feeling a little bearish here. the percentage of s&p components above their respective 50-day moving averages recently slipped below 60% as many high-flying names appeared to hit a wall. smaller stocks, biotechs, growth breakouts – all of these groups were hit hard heading into the new trading week. despite the recent weakness, stocks remain on track to eventually bounce and attack their highs. november is a seasonally strong month, especially for small-caps (which have taken a big hit following their election breakout). the same goes for the dow. both are outperforming the s&p and the nasdaq composite halfway through the month. we're seeing indexes and key names sitting at key levels. if they bounce, it's game on. if they begin to fail, we'll need to reassess. it's that simple. but it would be foolish to turn our backs on the bulls right now without any confirmation that the market is indeed breaking down and set to move lower. my end-of-year stock market playbook is simple: grab onto the plays most likely to melt-up into 2025 and ride them as far as they will take you.",0
2024-11-19,"in these market conditions, your best bet at booking outsized gains will likely come from the most speculative stocks and sectors. first, know your market conditions, the first step in any risk management plan. remember, the market is always changing. therefore, your trading strategies must evolve alongside the prevailing trends. for example, a bullish strategy involving any of the speculative growth stocks probably would have failed earlier this year when semiconductors and big tech (ahem, nvda) dominated the leaderboard. similarly, it pays to take profits early and avoid chasing some of the market's wilder breakouts when the averages are choppy or uncooperative (like the conditions we experienced in the late summer months). we've already established that we're entering more favorable trading conditions. barring a broader pullback this week, we're now firmly planted in one of the strongest trading windows of the year. that means breakouts and big moves in stocks are more likely to extend. in less favorable conditions, i'm pickier with my trades. if the market is flat or choppy, i'll wait for more confirmation and make smaller trades (usually half-size positions). in stronger markets like we're experiencing right now, i'll take more signals and put on full-size positions. once you nail down the market environment and decide on your position sizing, it's time to think about risk. more specifically, when are you going to bail on your trade if it begins to work against you?",0
2024-11-19,"most speculators have tunnel vision when it comes to new positions. they only want to think about potential profits. but a seasoned trader knows he won't always buy a winner. and the most important thing he can do is protect his account from unnecessary losses. that's where stop losses come in. i don't care what method you use – whether it's a moving average, dollar amount, or a percentage stop – you simply have to have some idea of when you are going to cut and run. most importantly, you should decide on the level beforeyou enter the trade. this way, your emotions won't be getting the best of you and causing any irrational decisions in the heat of battle. another great way to improve your winning potential is to sell a portion of a short-term trade when it hits a specific profit target. for options swing trades, this might mean locking in half of your gains after the position has doubled. this gives you the ability to let your trade run with house money. i'm always sure to let winners run (especially during melt-up season), but not at the expense of leaving open profits unprotected. professionals understand open profits belong to the market… sure, you can probably find some excellent long-term plays to buy and hold during melt-up season. but beaten-down stocks have the potential to be some of your best performing trades in a frothy market.",0
2024-11-19,"not only do you get the benefit of a rising tide – speculators are more inclined to take bigger risks and buy stocks they might normally avoid in less favorable conditions. these plays can offer big profits over shorter time frames. but there is one catch: many of these lower quality names tend to reverse and underperform over longer time frames. your best bet is to take profits on these more speculative trades when the market allows. my colleague enrique abeyta shared a helpful rule when it comes to stocks that offer exceptionally fast gains: if a stock doubles in a day, a week, or a month, you sell some. if it doubles in a year or two, you should add to your position. i love this piece of advice. not only is it succinct, it's also accurate. most incredibly sharp price moves are unsustainable in the long-term. it is highly unlikely for a stock that doubles in a week to consolidate sideways. instead, it will likely give back a good chunk of its previous move as it works to bleed off the excess momentum. events like these can easily shake out the weak hands of speculators who were not buying into the stock for any fundamental reason. once the quick profits are gone, they turn tail and run. compare this behavior to a stock that steadily climbs higher over the course of many months as it beats earnings and raises analysts' expectations. that's the kind of action that can help you confidently add to your longer-term position.",0

2024-11-17,"trump vs. the dollar part 2: madmen in authority article:no, the fed chair hasn't read the book. not yet... so the u.s. dollar still rules the world, even though nobody wants it to, says adrian ash at bullionvault, picking up where he left off looking at trump 2.0 vs. the greenback's reserve currency status. well, not apart from us consumers maybe. and chinese manufacturers. ""it may be correct to say that the role of the dollar allows americans to consume beyond their means,"" wrote former us investment banker and now china-trade-and-economy specialist michael pettis back in 2011. ""but it is just as correct, and probably more so, to say that foreign accumulations of dollars force americans to consume beyond their means."" that 2011 article from pettis was called 'an exorbitant burden'. it contrasted with the more regular view that the dollar represents ""an exorbitant privilege""... ...a phrase used by the french government of charles de gaulle to complain about us monetary dominance in the 1960s, and an idea repeated today by russia and china every time they complain about having to pile up dollars while risking loss of access to those piles through financial sanctions. pettis' more domestically-political view became a book in 2021, co-written with us financial columnist matthew klein: trade wars are class wars. pay attention. this might matter.",2
2024-11-17,"trade wars are class wars is an arresting and important book, up there with david graeber's debt: the first 5,000 years and liaquat ahamed's lords of finance as a must-read for anyone working or interested in money since the global financial crisis. but its power and timing is such that, as a must-read for anyone in politics, it's right up there with carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff's this time is different. among other things, that 2011 blockbuster famously said that too much government debt kills economic growth. in fact, the economy stops growing and starts shrinking when the state's total debt rises above 90% of gdp. you might recall this claim from such political campaigns as the uk conservatives' in 2010, 2015, 2019 and 2024, or us presidential hopeful paul ryan in 2013, or the european commission time and again. thing is, it wasn't true. reinhart & rogoff first presented the 90% rule in new year 2010. it was seized on by western governments, most especially in europe, to cut spending and impose 'austerity' on voters after the banking bail-outs of 2008-2012. but the data rested on a mistake in the harvard duo's excel spreadsheets. they took the average of only 15 instead of 20 case studies, missing big success stories which turned that small gdp decline into solid growth overall. a post-grad student spotted the error (he also thought they should have better weighted each country's gdp history in their xls, too), and the news broke out in 2013.",2
2024-11-17,"that led rogoff & reinhart to revise their data in public. but by then, it had already become truth. so as john maynard keynes said...a man who tried to avoid the dollar ruling the world after ww2, albeit to defend the uk's fading imperial star: ""practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. i am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas."" defunct is harsh. but here comes j.d.vance anyway. ""i think you can argue that the dollar's reserve currency status is a massive subsidy to american consumers but a massive tax on american producers."" now donald trump's vice-president, vance said that in march last year as a junior senator for ohio. hearing vance's comments on the dollar, ""i think he is a threat to our constitutional government,"" said pettis' co-author of trade wars, matthew klein. ""but he did read the book."" washington's ruling elite, in contrast, has not. not yet. ""we have the world reserve currency because of our democratic institutions, because of our control over inflation over many, many, many years, and the world trusts the rule of law."" so said us central bank boss jerome powell last year, replying to vance during that federal reserve appearance before lawmakers.",2
2024-11-17,"the world needs a stable dollar, in short. and it needs lots of dollars to keep growing too, because it oils the wheels of global trade and finance. so nothing will change and nor does it need to. next question. maybe powell should read the book. the big idea is that, as one review of trade wars puts it, preserving the dollar's no.1 reserve currency status means ""rust belt cities must dry up and blow away so the president can starve the iranian citizenry"" through sanctions. maybe that changes with the new ""madmen"" taking charge in january. ""we're done sacrificing supply chains to unlimited global trade,"" declared vance when he won the gop's nomination as trump's running mate at the republican national convention in milwaukee this july. ""we're going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label, 'made in the usa'. we're going to build factories again, put people to work making real products for american families, made with the hands of american workers. together, we will protect the wages of american workers and stop the chinese communist party from building their middle class on the backs of american citizens."" put another way, ""we have a big currency problem,"" said trump himself to bloomberg this summer. ""it's a tremendous burden."" do you think 60% tariffs on chinese imports will help? plus 10-20% on everyone else? anyone? anyone? anyone seen this before? personally i have no expertise or opinion on who's right or wrong.",2
2024-11-17,"but investors and savers need to play the hand we're dealt, and trump 2.0 is really going to shuffle the pack. china and russia have so far failed to unseat king dollar. no other currency stands ready to replace it, and judging by its ongoing dominance, the dollar's monetary power actually suits the rest of the world (sanctions aside), because it means the usa has to borrow to pay for what it buys. but king trump ii and his 2nd-in-command have other ideas. bad ones for sure, ill-thought through and currently driving the dollar higher and higher because of the inflation (and therefore higher fed interest rates) which everyone agrees massive trade tariffs, unfunded tax cuts and the mass deportation of illegal-but-low-wage workers will cause. but again...and even as trump's likely pick for treasury secretary says that tariffs are just a negotiation tool, not a promise...king donald no doubt has other ideas. lots of them, contradictory and confused, and mostly forgotten between breakfast and lunch. but they're trying to point in the same direction, and they will surely include appointing a new chairman of the federal reserve when the current term of jerome 'high rates' powell expires in may. ""my only question is, who is our bigger enemy, jay powell or chairman xi?"" shouted trump into the air back in 2019 after the fed failed to slash interest rates as the then-president wished. fast forward 5 years, and who's really the bigger threat to the dollar: putin or trump?",2
2024-11-16,"good gold stock drop article:'healthy correction' in hui... what we viewed as a bullish but frothy sector – the precious metals, which had led the post-march broad rally into late october – has finally taken the haircut it needed, says gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. or to use another turn of phrase, the precious metals correction, and especially gold stock correction, is sanitizing the sentiment and momentum profiles. the gold miners bullish percent index (bpgdm, not a sentiment gauge so much as a momentum gauge) has indeed taken a haircut off the frothy top. depending on the duration or severity of the correction, the bpgdm may or may not be done declining. but importantly, it means that a good number of miners' charts have triggered point & figure chart ""sell"" signals. that is momentum draining out of the sector, day by day. i have added rsi to the chart if for no other reason than it appears rsi, if not the index itself, provided a good negative divergence signal as gold stocks (hui) continued rising while bpgdm's rsi diverged. now rsi is getting toward oversold levels that have – with much grinding and volatility – marked gold stock correction lows. at the very least, bpgdm tells us the sector is well in the process of a healthy correction (ref. the bull market trend in bpgdm noted on the chart).",0
2024-11-16,"moving on, let's look at the corrective progress hui is making vs. the gold/rinf ratio, a gauge of gold's performance in relation to inflation signals and expectations. aside from continually proving wrong those who believe in and tout gold stocks as a way to hedge inflation (as many do in the public and in the gold stock analysis community), this chart shows that as gold has been dropping lately in relation to inflation signals, the miners are doing the right thing and also dropping. as you can see, the gold stock correction is dropping hui harder than the ratio. it is another sign that the sector is getting cleaned of the wrong kind of investors, err, speculators, inflationists, momo freaks, and hangers-on. a divergence like the one we noted last february (in real time in nftrh) that preceded the rally may or may not develop here, giving a buy signal. it is possible that the sharp decline by hui relative to gold/rinf could do the trick with no follow-up divergence building. in other words, this could be more of a flash event than an extended process. the gold stock correction has made very good technical progress by hitting levels we noted ahead of time in nftrh. while the correction is not yet clearly indicated to be over and there are potential targets lower, much price and sentiment risk has come out of the sector to this point. if gold continues to decline in relation to inflation signals, the going could get rougher.",0
2024-11-16,"if at some point the gold/rinf ratio stabilizes the miners would have a tailwind developing. as a side note, the above are just two of several ways to view gold stocks' internal situation. this is by no means an exhaustive article on the matter. nftrh has managed the gold stock correction since before it began (noting the frothy bpgdm above and the high risk profile of the gold price, among other things). traders will have sold, investors will have realized that it is likely a correction within a bull market, and i personally trimmed holdings, hedged a couple times and am feeling like scouting opportunity rather than praying the correction will end.",0

""what the united states owes to foreign countries it pays – at least in part – with dollars that it can simply issue if it chooses to."" so said french president charles de gaulle almost 6 decades ago, back when washington still backed its dollars with gold (but not enough of it) and us debt totalled less than half of america's gdp.

""this natural process is irreversible"" – and overthrowing the dollar's dominance is a big part of that switch. or it would be, if it was actually happening. yes, the dollar's dominance of central-bank reserves worldwide has fallen so far this century. but the decline has not accelerated since russia invaded ukraine and moscow got whacked by sanctions, not according to detailed analysis published by the international monetary fund. nor has it been anywhere near as dramatic as the rush for the exits of the late 1970s-to-early-80s. moreover, other western currencies have taken up the slack. china's yuan accounts for less than 1/4 of the dollar's drop (nobody wants rubles). on top of that, the strength of the dollar on the currency market just goes to show that private capital still wants greenbacks over anything else, even if sovereign reserve managers continue trimming the usd's share of their stash.",2

""the swift payment system can be used as a tool in attempts to suppress one of the states in the world,"" spits kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov says. and he should know. but reality is, a challenger system, using a single currency for the brics to trade with each other, simply ""isn't possible"" right now, peskov also admits. besides, the dollar as 'credit' works both ways. because while the seller gets the money, the buyer has to borrow it. the debtor then has to pay interest on what they owe... ...paying interest to the seller in the case of vendor-financing like the usa gets, effectively, from china.",2

""we are now living in a period of great historical change the likes of which we have not seen in 100 years."" russia's vladimir putin holds the same view, urging his counterparts at the recent brics summit of emerging-market nations to pursue a 'new world order' pitting the west against the rest. so why play by the west's decades-old 'rules' of transparency, co-operation and fairness, all imposed at the point of a gun or the sharp end of dollar-account sanctions? even where a gold-buying central bank has continued to update the world on its purchases, the appeal of gold stands out as a stateless currency... ...an asset which no one can create, destroy or control... ...making it very different to the us dollar, euro, pound or yen.",0
2024-11-08,"so the other big trend since 2022 both for invisible and reported central-bank gold buying has been for sovereign nations to buy in london – heart of the global gold market – and then ship it home. along with the new york fed, the bank of england is where central banks worldwide like to keep gold, ready to sell or lend should they need some cash. very little of those bank of england gold custody holdings are actually british. but thanks to other central banks using its services, the boe's gold vault tonnage set a series-record high in late 2021. however, the quantity of gold entrusted to the old lady's care beneath threadneedle street then shrank by 1/8th in just 2 years, and while it has rallied, it still lags the growth in reported central-bank gold reserves worldwide, never mind the best estimates for total holdings including the invisible stuff. take india, for instance. the reserve bank held 38.9% of its 760-tonne holdings at home in march 2022. that proportion has since risen to 59.7% of today's 854-tonne holdings. why? ""our gold was in a london vault. it is being brought back to an indian vault. it makes no difference at all,"" claimed former finance minister p.chidambaram when shipping some of india's gold to delhi a few years ago.",0
2024-11-08,"but ""we should care about it,"" said one twitter x user this diwali. ""we don't want our gold to be blocked by the us in case of a conflict, just like they did to russia."" so to recap, and like gavekal says, emerging-market gold demand from ""the rest vs. the west"" looks very likely a key driver of gold's big gains over the past few years. but so too does another major event. because that crack in how gold prices work, splitting from the traditional link with real us bond yields, ""also coincides with the decline in the world's largest asset market,"" notes a separate response on x.com. no, not us treasuries or even the s&p500, but chinese property... ...estimated to have been worth almost $90 trillion in 2022, ahead of the usa's total notional real estate value of $65 trillion. like china's real estate wealth, its stock market also began sinking in early 2022. and with cash interest rates on the floor (aiming to revive share prices and real estate but to no avail), savers and investors in china were left with little choice but to buy gold. that's because, unlike you or me, they couldn't go out and buy go-go us tech stocks. living under a communist dictatorship means you can't get your money out.",0
2024-11-08,"so gold demand in the no.1 consumer nation leapt as property and equities sank, driving the shanghai gold price sharply higher and boosting the incentive for new imports to fresh all-time highs in autumn 2023 as people piled into jewellery, coins and small bars, even gold-backed etf trust fund products. but here again, just as with central banking's invisible gold demand, china's private-sector rush into gold hasn't been completely visible. quite the reverse, in fact. lots of metal went in – and lots got mined in china too (it's been the no.1 miner nation since 2007) – but reported demand just didn't match up. this gap wasn't new in itself. but the size was. and so too was the solution to this puzzle for analysts and pundits. because where gold-backed bank accounts used to plug the gap... ...with analysis in the mid-2010s counting up all the gold added to commercial bank balance sheets to explain where the 'missing' metal had gone... ...",0
2024-11-08,"china's commercial bank gold holdings have instead been falling. ""a total of 2,700 tonnes of gold has gone missing in china in the past two years,"" said economist chen long back in june (formerly at gavekal, as it happens, but now running his own consultancy plenum), ""more than half of annual global gold production."" ""there are several possibilities that could explain where it has gone,"" chen went on, suggesting everything from central bank reserves to china's sovereign wealth fund or perhaps foreign banks importing gold and then holding onto it without reporting it on their quarterly filings. but most likely, and especially amid the surge of private-investor gold demand, chinese bank customers drove this hidden buying, adding metal which they own outright inside their bank's safe-deposit boxes or vaults, rather than leaving it on the bank's balance sheet. giving it to the bank in exchange for, say, zero storage fees, would be known as 'unallocated' gold. it lets you enjoy any price gains as a creditor only, rather than as an actual owner. it would therefore mean that the gold appeared on the bank's balance sheet, because it would belong to the bank. whereas going allocated (as you do by using bullionvault, only at vastly lower cost versus using a bank) means it doesn't show, because the metal isn't a bank asset (just like your property doesn't show on bullionvault's balance sheet either).",0
2024-11-08,"so again, as with central-banking's unreported purchases, this big move in chinese gold investment doesn't show up in the visible demand data. and nor does the real kicker of the past few months' surge to high after high after high: indirect demand driven by speculation in futures and options contracts. today's final chart shows just how much invisible and indirect demand has been driving gold prices higher. it uses data from the world gold council, who resolve this gap through what their excel spreadsheets call 'otc and other'. by that, they mean 'over the counter' transactions for wholesale gold and kilobars. because as with our example of allocated gold investors in china, none of that will show on a bank or a broker's balance sheet if the client owns the metal outright. the number also includes ""changes to inventories on commodity exchanges, any unobserved changes in fabrication inventories, and any statistical residual."" why rely on this fudge to balance the sums? basic economics says that demand must exactly match supply. but even if we accept that thesis, not all of the buying will come from active demand, driven by a free decision to own more gold. instead, a big chunk will come from banks, brokers and dealers needing to hedge their exposure to gold-price bets made by their clients. you see, whether or not any metal is involved, the futures and forwards tail really does wag today's spot-price dog. how?",0
2024-11-08,"first, if futures, forwards and options traders bid up the price of gold in 1 month or 3 months or 12 months' time, then the spot price will of course start rising too; and second, the more hot money that pours into those bullish bets on gold, then the more actual gold that somebody, somewhere along the chain, will have to buy to hedge their exposure in case those speculators turn out to be right. this indirect demand has become a big part of gold's bull market in 2024. it started with the chinese gold rush this spring, when that surge in real demand for coins and retail bars was outpaced by a surge in speculative gold trading in shanghai. it then switched, via a brief spell of hedge funds apparently trading options and swaps in the london physical market, to us comex contracts, where the speculative long position (net of that group's bearish bets) just set a new all-time gold derivatives record by value. what's been missing, however, was western investment demand for coins, small bars, vaulted bullion, metal-backed etfs or any other product directly involving physical gold.",0
2024-11-08,"whereas now, ""western investors are returning to the gold market,"" according to us investment bank goldman sachs, recommending gold as a hedge against potential geopolitical shocks, trade tensions, federal reserve rate cuts, and debt concerns. ""this needs to continue to shift,"" says john reade, market strategist at the mining industry's world gold council, because while ""the last few years have really been dominated by emerging-market buying of gold – whether by central banks or in jewellery or bar and coin investment – those categories are beginning to slow down a bit. ""western investors added to their exchange-traded gold fund holdings in the third quarter,"" says reade, ""so that's a positive start. but the physical coin and small investment bar market in the west still remains quiet. we need to see that improve for gold to trade sustainably higher i think."" western demand stayed quiet because... ...unlike china's population, and unlike emerging-market central bankers fearing us sanctions... ...western investors haven't been suffering a crisis. cost of living jumped, sure. but so did the stock market, and average wages, and house prices, even interest rates on cash in the bank too. and all while the jobless rate held near multi-decade records at or close to 'full employment'. but this looks to be changing. us data for september's job vacancies and october's net hiring were awful.",0
2024-11-08,"western central banks have started cutting the returns to cash, just as western stock markets struggle to regain or beat the late-summer's fresh all-time highs. uk and french investors meantime face stark new tax rises, especially for larger savers and wealthier households, plus a fresh drag on jobs growth from higher employer taxation. germany faces the collapse of its fragile coalition government, and spain faces fresh turmoil between madrid and would-be breakaway regions over its slow response to this autumn's terrible and devastating floods. cue a big jump in new gold investing among uk, french and spanish investors. italy too. hell, even germany is seeing new investors start buying bullion after europe's gold-market darling fell off a cliff when the eurozone central bank finally moved to raise interest rates from below zero right around the time russia invaded ukraine and gold snapped its set-your-watch correlation with real interest rates. so far, however, us investors themselves continue to sit out buying gold. maybe that's because the democrat candidate just lost (and was always going to lose). maybe it's because the stock market continues to soar. either way, you can read the full story in our latest gold investor index data and comment. as you'll see, western gold investing demand... ...and its impact on precious metals prices... ...could be about to become very visible and very direct as donald trump returns to the white house.",0

""i'd also top up pensions and individual savings accounts (isas), with the caveat that a corbyn [now starmer] government could easily force redirection of the assets within pensions in particular. can you imagine a scenario in which a fiscally bombed out government puts in place regulations requiring all pension assets over, say, £500,000-a-head, to be invested in, say, perpetual 'national regeneration bonds'?"" which brings us to the second phase of the pre-emptive measures that could plausibly make sense, namely wealth preservation. longstanding readers will likely be familiar with the ""wealth preservation"" aspect of this debate, because it is the bedrock of our discretionary portfolio approach.",2

2024-11-04,"rob's version, 'built to last', is effectively the opposite, and also a great way of teaching the merits of diversification in a way that even young children can relate to: ""the aim was to grow £50 as much as possible by building towers that had to reach a certain height to accumulate compound interest; 60 cm = 25% 80 cm = 50% 100 cm = 200% 120 cm = 500% ""you were given 3 attempts, each lasting 2 and a half minutes. ""the rules of the game were stacked to favour particular strategies. specifically ones which, if applied to your real world savings, happen to help you grow your long term wealth."" so what were the lessons that meant you could excel and climb the leader board? the sooner you start, the more your savings can begin to compound. don't spend too long thinking; start building and keep banking! and come back! properly spreading your risks is a good idea in the long run. accept you will suffer occasional losses; build more than one tower. don't just build 60cm every time – occasionally going for higher risk reaps huge rewards; you may well make mistakes and lose money. right sizing your risks will keep you in the game; regardless of the rewards, don't even try making it to 120cm! you need a strategy that carries the appropriate amount of risk that allows you to reach your goal. a combination of 60cm, 80cm and 100cm will take you to the top; a strategy is only successful if it meets your objectives. how others perform is irrelevant.",2

2024-10-31,"countries should specialize in what they do best, and let others also specialize in what they do best. then countries could simply trade the goods they make for the goods made by others. all sides would be better off because prices would be lower as a result of specialization in those goods where you have a natural advantage. it's a nice theory often summed up in the idea that tom brady shouldn't mow his own lawn because it makes more sense to pay a landscaper while he practices football. for example, if the uk had an advantage in textile production and portugal had an advantage in wine production, then the uk and portugal should trade wool for wine. but if the theory of comparative advantage were true, japan would still be exporting tuna fish instead of cars, computers, tvs, steel and much more. the same can be said of the globalists' view that capital should flow freely across borders. that might be advantageous in theory but market manipulation by central banks and rogue actors like goldman sachs and big hedge funds make it a treacherous proposition. the problem with this theory of comparative advantage is that the factors of production are not permanent and they are not immobile. if labor moves from the countryside to the city in china, then suddenly china has a comparative advantage in cheap labor. if finance capital moves from new york banks to direct foreign investment in chinese factories, then china has the comparative advantage in capital also.",1
2024-10-31,"trump understands this, micklethwait doesn't. trump didn't just make polite conversation in the interview. he called out micklethwait by saying, ""it must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative and then have somebody explain to you that you're totally wrong."" ouch! micklethwait certainly isn't alone. listening to hysterical commentary from the mainstream media about trump's tariffs, one would think his policies were in violation of the us constitution. nothing could be further from the truth. by advocating tariffs, trump actually wants to return to what made america great in the first place. in fact, tariffs are as american as apple pie. from 1790-1962, the united states pursued high tariff policies under a program known as the american system. it was created by george washington's secretary of the treasury, alexander hamilton, who drafted a report to congress called the report on manufactures presented in 1791. hamilton proposed that in order to have a strong country, america needed a strong manufacturing base with jobs that taught skills and offered income security. to achieve this, hamilton proposed subsidies to us businesses so they could compete successfully against more established uk and european businesses. these subsidies might include grants of government land or rights of way, purchase orders from the government itself or outright payments.",1
2024-10-31,"this was a mercantilist system that encouraged a trade surplus and the accumulation of gold reserves. hamilton's plan was later proposed on a broader scale by kentucky sen. henry clay. this new plan began with the tariff of 1816. later on, abraham lincoln adopted the american system as his platform in the election of 1860, and it became a bedrock principle of the new republican party. it was affirmed by william mckinley at the end of the 19th century and by dwight eisenhower in the 1950s. the 19th and early 20th centuries were a heyday of the american system. this period was characterized by enormous economic growth and population expansion by the us the american system was also accompanied mostly by low inflation or even deflation (which increases the purchasing power of everyday citizens) despite occasional financial panics and some inflation during the civil war. the key takeaway is that america grew rich and powerful from 1787-1962, a period of 175 years, using tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to trade to nurture domestic industry and protect high-paying manufacturing jobs. but under the neo-liberal, globalist international order that prevailed in the decades after world war ii, free trade doctrine supplanted the american system. globalism requires free trade, open borders and free capital flows or as close as you can come. in theory, this allows for price discovery, lower costs and higher returns to capital.",1

""it is the difference between total supply and gold demand,"" concludes the world gold council's note – and supply from gold mining is seeing ""a big push from producers for a record year"" as the market price of gold bullion runs to new all-time highs. household and industrial demand, in contrast, has fallen so far in 2024, plunging in no.1 consumer china as jewelry demand falls 27.5% year-to-date and offsetting a rise in no.2 india with weakness in other countries – such as germany, where retail bar and coin demand continues to collapse. all told, that has led to an overall drop of 11.1% in fabricated product demand by weight in the first 9 months of 2024 on today's wgc figures, compiled from fieldwork, analysis and intelligence gathered by specialist analysts metals focus. central banks as a group meanwhile halved their net demand in july-to-september on metals focus' estimates for the wgc compared to q3 last year, dropping to the lowest quarterly buying since spring 2023.",2

2024-10-30,"election 2024: all roads lead to inflation article:so buy gold and silver, right...? with only one week remaining before the us presidential election, there's a growing sense of uncertainty in the air, writes frank holmes at us global investors. investors are wondering how to position their money, bracing for the possibility of significant volatility and market shifts. while some hedge funds are making bold moves on so-called ""trump trades"", we at us global investors see things differently. in fact, i share billionaire hedge fund manager paul tudor jones' recent outlook on gold and bitcoin (which validates what i have been writing about for many years). like him, we currently favor alternative assets as the smart play going forward. it's not that we're betting against stocks or the economy, which we believe will do well over time no matter who wins the white house next month. nevertheless, the writing is clearly on the wall: ballooning us debt and geopolitical tensions all point to the need for a strong hedge. you won't be surprised to read that the us debt situation has spiraled out of control. just 25 years ago, the national debt was a little under 60% of gdp. today, that rate has doubled to 120%. according to paul tudor jones, founder and ceo of tudor investment corp., this puts the us in a precarious position – ne that's unsustainable in the long run unless serious action is taken to rein in government spending.",2
2024-10-30,"we all know that politicians have a knack for promising more spending (in the democrats' case) or tax cuts (in the republicans' case) to keep voters happy. it's easy to see why jones is concerned that either approach will only exacerbate the debt problem. as he pointed out, the us is ""going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues."" that's not just a dramatic soundbite – it's a reality check. the federal deficit for 2024 soared above $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the previous year. meanwhile, the debt burden, which is rapidly nearing $36 trillion, shows no signs of easing. us federal deficit of tax revenue to government spending when the government keeps printing money to finance its spending, the inevitable result is inflation. and in times of inflation, the purchasing power of traditional assets like bonds erodes. that's why jones favors assets that perform well in inflationary environments such as gold, silver, commodities and bitcoin. i agree wholeheartedly with this assessment. think about it: why would you want to own fixed-income assets when interest rates are being adjusted and are likely to be lower than the inflation rate? long-dated bonds are particularly vulnerable. us banks, remember, are still dealing with billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their fixed-income positions.",2
2024-10-30,"according to florida atlantic university's bank screener, bank of america's unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investments in the first quarter were a staggering $110 billion, more than any other us institution by far. the fed will likely try to ""inflate"" its way out of this mess, meaning it will keep nominal interest rates lower than inflation to support economic growth. for investors, this means that preserving wealth will require smart positioning in alternative assets. jones is already betting against the bond market – ""i am clearly not going to own any fixed-income,"" he told cnbc last week – and i believe many investors would be wise to take a similar approach. let's start with gold and silver. both have been go-to haven assets for centuries, and for good reason. when geopolitical tensions have risen, when inflation has reared its ugly head and/or when there's been uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold and silver. this year is no exception. we've seen gold shatter records multiple times in 2024, with prices rising more than 32% year-to-date, the metal's best annual growth since 1979. according to data from the world gold council, gold has consistently outperformed both inflation and the growth rate of the world economy. from 1971 to 2023, gold's compound annual growth rate (cagr) was 8%, compared to 4% for the us consumer price index (cpi) and 7.8% for global gdp growth.",2
2024-10-30,"silver, often dubbed the ""poor man's gold,"" is another asset that deserves attention. with its industrial applications, especially in the green energy sector, silver has strong potential for future growth. according to one projection, the clean energy transition could dramatically increase the demand for silver in photovoltaic (pv) technology, potentially consuming between 85% and a jaw-dropping 98% of current global silver reserves by 2050. now, let's talk about bitcoin. the world's largest digital asset has quickly become a preferred store of value for many investors, especially those looking to hedge against fiat currency depreciation. nearly half of all traditional hedge funds currently maintain exposure to cryptos, including bitcoin. institutions are also backing bitcoin with the same enthusiasm. just look at blackrock's bitcoin etf. it's one of the fastest-growing etfs in financial history, with assets under management now over $26 billion. that's no small feat. bitcoin's decentralized nature, capped supply and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive asset in times of uncertainty. like gold, it's a hedge against inflation, but it also offers the potential for significant upside as more investors and institutions recognize its value. now, i know you may be wondering: ""what about the election? what if trump wins? what if harris wins?"" here's a news flash for you: over the long run, it may not matter as much as you think.",2

""i'm having conversations where people tell me they can't see gold trading below $2300 again,"" said one panel member, noting how this year's steep rise and high levels mean gold is ""losing part of the retail market."" but while gold has become ""volatile, it's a buy and hold investment,"" said another speaker.

""why's that?"" you ask? first because of those portfolio benefits. second because, well, just read the news. global politics are a bloody mess, and while november's us election might at least resolve the direction and engagement of the world's dominant power (possibly not all for the bad if trump wins, according to the geopolitical discussion which kicked off the lbma conference today), it won't solve that.",2
2024-10-14,"silver, unlike gold, doesn't enjoy central-bank reserves demand. (russia recently said it's maybe adding non-gold precious metals to its non-central bank holdings; one of today's central-bank panellists said they looked at silver but the price is too volatile to act as a diversifier). yet the price has still risen by 35% since the lbma conference met in barcelona in october 2024. and even more than in gold, the bulk of private investment action has been to sit tight, rather than take profit. maybe, as the silver table i joined at this evening's roundtable discussions agreed, that's because silver still looks 'cheap' relative both to gold ( via the gold/silver ratio) and to its historical highs of the past 50 years. silver's big top at $50 in january 1980 would now equate to $200 per troy ounce in real inflation-adjusted dollars, and april 2011's re-touch of that level would cost $70. whereas silver today is trading at $31. more on the industrially useful precious metal coming tomorrow morning at the lbma conference's formal silver session. follow bullionvault on x.com for live updates – and watch x and goldnews to see where conference attendees put their gold and silver price forecasts for the coming 12 months after last year's big miss. from all the conversations i've had so far, everyone here thinks we'll see both precious metals trading higher (and higher) for longer (and longer).",2

2024-10-08,"and as our chart shows, that's because... ...like with any survey of price forecasts... ...people tend to report what they have just seen, projecting either a flat price or the same kind of move into the future, rather than offering any insight into how upcoming events might impact the gold market. (just shift the forecast's red dots by 1 year back to see that at work.) on top of this, however, you would hope that the lbma's industry players do also add a few bucks (or subtract them) to their forecasts to account for what they learn by attending the conference. most importantly, they will also add (or subtract) a couple of hundred bucks based on how busy their own business has been, plus how that activity squares with what friends, competitors, suppliers and customers say they are seeing over a beer or two. ""tumbleweed!"" for instance was the summary from most attendees at lbma 2023 in barcelona when asked ""how's business?"" hence the very gently bullish outlook for gold given by the average attendee. the price of gold was trading at $1910 per troy ounce this time last year. that marked a record high for october, just pipping autumn 2020's covid lockdown price of $1900 when the conference met online. but the vast bulk of attendees couldn't understand it, because they serve consumers and physical investors, not central banks or hot-money traders in comex or shanghai futures and options.",0

2024-10-08,"third, silver gets a starring role at next week's conference too (the pgms get a 'reasons to be cheerful' session all to themselves as well) thanks not only to silver's fast-growing use in 'green' energy, military and ai technology but also thanks to its fast-slowing mine output growth. so might deficits of supply vs. demand send the silver price soaring? fourth and leading the debate, however, we clearly live in ""turbulent times""...the title of next monday's investment panel discussion. like i say, conference last year missed the impact and importance (if not the horror) of hamas attacking israel. but while gold and silver prices have soared since then as israel's bombardment of gaza and now its war with hezbollah in lebanon threatens to become outright confrontation with iran, crude oil has not risen ( well, not yet) while global stock markets have like gold jumped to new all-time highs. is gold really the most ghoulish investment? might its price sink if peace breaks out? turbulence, in other words, isn't hitting gold, silver, equity and energy prices like you might have expected. here's hoping it doesn't hit flights to miami too badly and that the awful forecasts for hurricane milton hitting florida prove as wide of the mark as last year's gold and silver conference price outlook. watch out for lbma 2024 news and updates at bullionvault on x and here on gold news.",0

2024-10-02,"it's also important to note that we don't have great data on russia or china, which could both be buying substantially more bullion than reported. there's rich irony in the fact that the primary gold bulls today aren't individual investors, it's the guys running the fiat printers. this is an insider buy signal at a global scale. and these aren't fickle day traders in for a quick flip. these central banks have a new reserve policy, and it appears to heavily favor gold. over the past 75 years, the us dollar emerged as the world's leading international reserve asset. it eclipsed gold in the early 1990s and remains dominant to this day. but the trend has finally flipped. today, gold as a percent of international reserves is climbing, and the dollar is falling. this is a monumentally important trend. de-dollarization is actually beginning to happen. but central banks aren't switching to the chinese renminbi or the euro, they're reverting to classic hard currency: gold. it's re-goldification on a massive scale. the era of fiat dominance may well be in its twilight years. and good riddance. being home to the world's reserve currency has hollowed out the us manufacturing base and caused spending to spiral out of control. all of this helps confirm my view that we are still very early on precious metals. fed printing operations are just now about to start back up. qe will eventually reignite, and the scale will likely dwarf previous episodes within a few years.",2

2024-10-01,"by weight, investors using bullionvault cut their combined gold holdings by 353 kilograms last month – the heaviest net liquidation since april's record 992kg outflow – down to a new 50-month low beneath 44.5 tonnes. but by value, those holdings – all securely stored and insured in specialist vaults in each client's choice of london, new york, singapore, toronto or most popular zurich – grew 3.8% to a new record above $3.7 billion (+2.0% to £2.8bn, +3.0% to €3.3bn, both also a new record). september's count of new users worldwide at bullionvault slipped 6.5% from august's 4-month high, but it came in 118.4% above the same month last year and rose 29.0% from its prior 12-month average. within those numbers, first-time investors in the us and uk rose to the highest monthly count since april, up 20.0% and 5.5% respectively from august's figure and coming 75.6% and 44.6% above their prior 12-month average. new users in the eurozone in contrast fell 25.6% month-on-month, led by a 36.0% drop in france and a 45.5% fall in italy, with continued weakness in germany seeing the 20-nation currency union as a whole bring only 2.5% more new users in september than the prior 12-month average. so like with this spring's brief rally in italy and then france, the current jump in us and uk first-time bullion buyers looks specific to short-term domestic uncertainty.",0
2024-10-01,"november's us election could go either way, while the uk budget due at the end of this month is raising anxiety among consumers, business and investors over the new labour government's tax and spending plans. silver prices have also tended to drop in september, falling in 8 of the 10 years to 2023. but like gold, the more industrially-useful precious metal leapt in price last month gaining 8.3% in dollars – and hitting its highest since christmas 2012 – while rising 6.5% in uk pounds and 7.4% in euro terms. in response, the silver investor index fell hard, down 4.2 points to a 4-month low of 48.9 and signalling more sellers than buyers for the first time since may. that was when the dollar price had risen through $32 per troy ounce for the first time in over 11 years, a level it re-took but then lost again last month. seizing on silver's latest spike, investors sold 12.0 tonnes more of the precious metal than they bought across september as the price hit new 12-year highs. that marked the first net liquidation since may, and it cut client holdings to 1,167 tonnes. worth 4.3% more by dollar value from august however, that set a new record for bullionvault users' silver holdings at $1.1bn in terms of the us currency, but it missed a new record in sterling or euros, rising 2.4% to £865m and 3.3% to €1.0bn, both below may's peak value.",0
2024-10-01,"still, with prices rising faster than the pace of investor selling, the total value of bullionvault's client holdings overall rose to a new record in all 3 currencies in september, reaching $5.0 billion (£3.7bn, €4.4bn) when counting the gold, silver, platinum and palladium, all securely stored and insured in specialist vaults, belonging to more than 100,000 users from 175 countries. what comes next? looking ahead, it's hard to believe that last week's gold tops above $2680 and £2000 and €2400 per troy ounce will mark a long-term peak like new year 1980, summer 2011 or even summer 2020 did. that's because, contrary to all the talk about 'safe haven demand', western investors have been selling or ignoring precious metals, not buying the stuff. imagine what happens when they get involved again. the next $5 billion might arrive a lot faster than the first.",0
2024-09-30,"chips, rice and protectionism: a big success? article:trade tariff lessons from ww2 and modern japan... the basic concept of economic nationalism is that a policy is good if it benefits members of the nation, which basically means the members of commonwealth, or state, writes nathan lewis on his new world economics blog. if it doesn't benefit the members of the nation, then what makes it good? for example: let's say that there's an automobile factory in detroit. but ford decides that it would like to build its newest factory in georgia, not detroit, for whatever reason. this might be bad for workers in detroit. but it would be good for workers in georgia. we calculate that, since both georgia and detroit are part of the nation, then it is something of a zero-sum, at worst. workers in detroit can even just move to georgia and work in the new factory. but competition between michigan and georgia is also good, because it tends to lead to better outcomes overall. in terms of economic nationalism, it is a positive. but let's say that ford wants to build a factory in mexico. now mexicans benefit, from more good-paying jobs, and americans do not benefit, although you could argue that they benefit a little bit from perhaps lower selling prices of ford automobiles. unemployed factory workers in michigan cannot easily migrate to mexico; nor would they want to, given the low wages in mexico.",2
2024-09-30,"however, all economists agree that wealth comes from production and productivity, and we have just made americans less productive, because they no longer have a factory to make cars, and are instead standing around unemployed. basically, capital is leaving the us, resulting in a poorer capital/labor ratio. thus, if we look at the actual history of the united states, we find that it is based on absolute free trade within the nation (among states), and generally a long history of protectionism, or tariffs, with the rest of the world – ie, other nations. this makes sense, from the standpoint of economic nationalism. there is nothing in economic theory, of the ""general economic principles"" variety, that can make sense of the national difference between a factory in georgia and a factory in mexico. they just assume that – since free trade is very good between the states of the united states, then the same principle applies also for the whole world, because we are too lazy to think if this is actually true or not. during the 1960s, there was a fairly strong movement toward economic independence, or the idea that a country should try to make goods and services domestically, rather than being dependent on imports. this had a political aspect. if you were completely dependent on fossil fuel imports, and had no domestic sources of energy, then you would be at the total mercy of others exporting fossil fuels to you.",2
2024-09-30,"this might seem fanciful, but it is exactly what happened to japan, which was almost totally dependent on imports of petroleum. when imports from indonesia and elsewhere in asia were cut off in june 1941, it left japan completely dependent on imports from the united states. when the us cut off oil exports to japan in september 1941, japan had basically been served a death sentence. the reaction was to gain control of the oilfields of indonesia. indonesia was then known as the netherlands east indies, since it was ruled by the netherlands. but ""the netherlands"" no longer existed. it was under german military occupation since 1940, and germany was a defensive ally in the anti-communist anti-comintern pact of 1936. it made sense for japan to grab the oilfields of the undefended netherlands east indies. but this was blocked by the us fleet at subic bay, in the philippines, and also hawaii; and the british outpost at singapore, which controlled the strait of malacca. to secure the shipping lanes between indonesia and japan, the japanese military attacked both the us naval bases in the philippines and hawaii, and singapore. it is not very well remembered today that the japanese government actually promoted self-rule for the former european colonies in asia, including the netherlands east indies. of course it would be something of a ""puppet government"", and a friendly posture toward the occupiers was basically mandatory – the same as japan itself after ww2.",2
2024-09-30,"but, it nevertheless would have had a lot of control over domestic conditions. so we see that securing natural resources, and not being dependent on (potentially unfriendly) foreign sources for key items, has actually been a big deal in the past. since that time, we've learned that most countries really cannot hope for any meaningful form of economic self-reliance. most countries have no meaningful fossil fuels, and are dependent on imports. attempts to create domestic manufacturing industries, or ""import substitution"" as it was called, have mostly been a failure. people in honduras, vietnam, or morocco are much better off buying an iphone from apple than trying to make their own domestic smartphones. people in mozambique, portugal or the philippines are much better off buying an automobile from ford or toyota than trying to make their own automobiles. actually, there has been a trend for international manufacturers to establish domestic factories, such as a honda plant in brazil, but even these are commonly dependent on long supply chains from around the world. since countries have to pay for these imports somehow, they also have to sell something to the rest of the world. thus, we get a tendency toward specialization and trade, at the national level as well.",2
2024-09-30,"while this is almost unavoidable for most countries in the world, which are not very big and cannot have any meaningful hope of ""economic self-reliance"" in a state of contemporary industrialization, the larger countries, which basically have ""superpower"" militaries, see things differently. mostly, this is the us, russia, china, and europe taken as a whole – the eu. while fossil fuel or automobile or electronics ""independence"" is hardly realistic for most countries, nearly any country can aspire to generate most or all of its own food. this is, of course, perhaps even more important than fossil fuels, when it comes to avoiding potential means of aggression by foreign governments. also, although cars and iphones are modern features, nearly every locality has a centuries-old tradition of local farming. we don't feel this in the united states so much, but what does it mean for france or japan to see its domestic agriculture tradition basically disappear, because it is cheaper to import food from brazil? to see the fields that have been cultivated literally for centuries, become abandoned or built over? what if the japanese no longer grew rice, not because rice fields don't exist – they do – but because thai or california rice was cheaper? this leads to a natural effort to ""protect"" local agriculture. japan has long had a policy that all rice would be domestically grown, with prices rising to the point to make this possible. no rice imports.",2
2024-09-30,"this of course infuriates california rice growers, but it makes a lot of sense for japan. japan imports more than half of all its food anyway. however, the rice policy both preserves an ancient tradition, and core component of culture and national identity, and also at least preserves a substantial and meaningful level of food independence, even if japan falls far short of becoming a net food exporter like the united states. (if you are wondering, the high inherent cost of growing rice in japan has led to a tendency toward quality. japanese rice is very, very good. there are farms in california that attempt to grow rice that is as good as the rice from japan. as a rice enthusiast, i can say that japanese rice, and also these super-premium california brands, are far better than the cheaper options, and well worth the extra price, even though they can cost five or ten times as much – about $3 a pound, or $4 for organic – than the 50lb bag at costco. the super-premium california brands like our personal favorite, kagayaki, cost the same as japanese rice.) today the united states, which is not very concerned about food (it is a huge food producer), or fossil fuels, is instead concerned about semiconductor chip supply. ""specialization and trade"" has led to most us chips coming from taiwan and elsewhere – all of which could be potentially cut off, much as japan's oil supply was cut off by the united states in september 1941.",2
2024-09-30,"this extends not only to chips, but electronics components throughout the supply chain, and also the very sophisticated robotic machines that today assemble these components into final products. even if ""electronics self-reliance"" is perhaps difficult at this time, at least there should be a substantial local industrial base. this not only insures at least some supply, but also the engineering and managerial knowledge that could ramp up this local supply quickly if necessary. the economic nationalists see these needs clearly, while the ""general economics principles"" people have really nothing to go on to make a decision one way or another on this. it would mean violating their ""general economics principles"", leaving them often with nothing. like most real-world situations, these things also change with time. taiwan semiconductor supply was not that much of a concern in 2005; and now it is a big concern. recently: there are a number of things potentially wrong with this, but also a number of things potentially right. it certainly would prompt a move toward economic self-reliance, since local industries would have a substantial advantage selling in the local market. note also that this avoids the terrible item-by-item approach for broad flat tariffs, 20% on everything, and an (additional?) 60% on china. of course it is not quite so simple.",2
2024-09-30,"it would make sense for chinese products to pass through the philippines, for instance, and be sprinkled with magic fairy dust making them ""philippine products"" for export to the us. but, nevertheless, it could be the start of a good policy – especially combined with tax cuts elsewhere, as patrick buchanan argued. he suggested eliminating the corporate income tax, making the overall economic effect (higher tariffs, lower other taxes) a strong positive. during the entire 19th century, the united states had very high tariffs, and no income taxes at all. it was a big success.",2
2024-09-27,"mortgage refi booms for goldilocks article:but ask why rates are falling... some media, along with anecdotal sources witnessed on x, are trumpeting how strong the economy will be in 2025, using a mortgage refinance boom as a rationale, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. while that will put some tailwind to the economy, my view is that it is simply one factor extending the goldilocks economic phase – characterized by fading inflation signals/expectations and a still intact (but not as intact as portrayed) economy – conveniently, in alignment with nftrh's favored ""to or through the election"" projection for the economy and by association, markets. this article simply notes the ""boom"" in refinancing, without really extrapolating it further to a ""strong economy"" view. but the public is well aware that rates are coming down (our target is 3.2% or so on the 30-year treasury yield) and certain entities are going to promote that as ""inflation is easing"" and ""the economy is improving"" to serve agenda. and i'm not only talking politics, as the massive financial services industry has skin in the game of keeping the public docile and obedient (ie, not trying to pull its capital out of the markets and out of its advisors' pockets). for effect, here is the 30yr yield once again, as it is now and has long been one of my favorite pictures into the macro. you can see the basis for the 3.2% yield projection.",2
2024-09-27,"it's the former backbone (now broken) that had held yields in check for decades. now it will act as support. market participants are celebrating the decline in yields and the softening fed. but they are weakening and softening for a reason. if that reason (a weakening economy) persists, and policymakers (fiscal and/or monetary) react as they have historically, the future inflation problem could be severe...and the continuum would factor that by holding the 3.2% area and turning up into the next phase. but that's all future projection. for now, why don't we just turn off our brains like the legions of fomo-driven momos entering markets from stocks to (now) commodities to – sorry my buggish friends – precious metals. in discussing future negatives, i am not talking my book because my book includes all of the things listed just above, and no short positions. my book has been ""to or through the election"" all year. my book projected goldilocks over 1.5 years ago. it's probably important to note who was saying what, when. i am not a perma-bear. i am a guy telling what i see.",2
2024-09-26,"hey gary, why no 'imminent' concern? article:sec slip-up hints at fresh financial fears... oops, says adam sharp in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. last week the sec accidentally published internal commentary along with a speech by chair gary gensler. here's one of the comments which was mistakenly included. ""i strongly recommend that a sentence be placed here (or somewhere in the first part of the speech) to reassure markets that you are not making the speech because you think there is an imminent crisis."" these internal comms were quickly deleted from sec.gov, but not before the page was archived for posterity. the slip-up reveals anxiety among regulators over messaging. mr.gensler's speech addressed financial crises, bank restructurings, and the importance of public disclosures. in it, the sec chair rightly argued that depositors need transparency to make good decisions. ""if a large financial institution is restructured, the market's need for disclosure doesn't go away. indeed, i believe the market's need for robust disclosure becomes all the more critical. first, it is the best way to ensure that investors, counterparties, and depositors will have sufficient confidence to remain with the firm."" it's a solid point, transparency does need to improve. but there's something else missing here that we need to discuss.",0
2024-09-26,"back in june, daily reckoning's jim rickards warned that the banking crisis may still have legs. ""investors are relaxed because they believe the banking crisis is over. that's a huge mistake. history shows that major financial crises unfold in stages and have a quiet period between the initial stage and the critical stage."" in the article, mr.rickards pointed out a key flaw with mr.gensler's argument that transparency should allow depositors to make wise decisions. that flaw is the speed at which money moves in today's world. ""on the other hand, this crisis could reach the acute stage faster. that's because of technology that makes a bank run move at the speed of light. with an iphone, you can initiate a $1 billion wire transfer from a failing bank while you're waiting in line at mcdonald's. no need to line up around the block in the rain waiting your turn. ""when a crisis hits, rational analysis is often the first casualty. in this world where money moves in a blink, if you hear about potential issues at your bank, most of us aren't going to pull up its financial filings, spend hours analyzing them, and then make a decision. we're going to move it to a safer bank (or a mattress, or into gold) asap."" so while it is good to hear that the sec chair favors more transparency, it doesn't do much to allay our concerns. more disclosure could actually accelerate a crisis due to the velocity of information and money today. if a crisis hits, things can happen fast.",0
2024-09-26,"let's get back to those accidentally-published internal comments. an sec staffer was concerned that mr.gensler's speech might give the impression of an ""imminent crisis"". whenever regulators discuss the solvency of financial institutions there's a risk that it is interpreted negatively by markets. it's a valid worry. unfortunately, in this market, there are some excellent reasons to interpret the remarks in a cautious light. let's start with the latest data on unrealized losses at banks. remember when this chart was making the rounds in 2022 and 2023? the updated fdic data continues to show an unprecedented and sustained rise in unrealized losses at banks. notice how small the losses during the global financial crisis appear in comparison. these are unrealized losses on banks' bond portfolios, primarily caused by the fed's rapid interest rate hikes. when rates rise, the value of existing bonds (with lower yields than new bonds) falls. this is what caused the failure of silicon valley bank. unrealized losses stand at $512 billion as reported by the fdic, down from a peak of around $655 billion. the data has improved a bit, but bank balance sheets remain stressed at historic levels. ongoing interest rate cuts should help stem the unrealized bleeding at banks. as rates fall, the price of bonds will rise. but lower rates should also mean lower profitability for the lending side of the business, so it's somewhat of a double-edged sword for banks.",0
2024-09-26,"even if the unrealized loss situation gets resolved, there are other potential black swans to monitor. after all, why is the fed planning to cut rates, apparently with haste? are they simply trying to get ahead of bank losses and soaring debt servicing costs? or do they potentially see a recession or financial crisis in the near future? let's review our situation. the fed is preparing for economic turbulence. gold is trying to tell us something as it powers to new all-time highs. job growth for the year was recently revised sharply downward. and now regulators are making speeches about restructuring large financial institutions. it sure feels like something's brewing. if you want to be proactive and check your bank's unrealized loss ratio, you can use a free tool by florida atlantic university. this screener isn't perfect and doesn't tell you everything about a bank's health, but it's a start. besides moving to a better bank, gold and silver remain an excellent way to prepare for potential calamities.",0
2024-09-25,"putting the tin foil hat aside article:but still asking: why cut now? why so deep...? the september 22 edition of notes from the rabbit hole (#828) had some things to say about the fomc action last week, before putting its tin foil hat back in the closet, getting down to the business of managing markets the fed held off, held off, held off some more, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. it held rates at a high level for meeting after meeting, despite the fade in inflation signals that we've expected (and now seen) since q1 2023 (goldilocks), unemployment that has long-since based and turned up, and despite the fact that it has been government itself – along with embedded and lagging services industries – that have kept the employment numbers afloat. this is leaving aside the fact that bls has revised these headline numbers down. this begs the question, why even pay attention to payrolls as initially reported? it begs another question. why cut now, and why cut by an attention grabbing 50 basis points? why did a president barely in possession of his faculties weigh in and protesteth too much, only to be caught in a lie (or a mental lapse) about having sat with the fed chief? why? maybe because new highs for the s&p 500 at a strategic pre-election juncture supports our long-held bull view of ""to or through the election"". chart of the s&p500 index. source: nftrh putting the tin foil hat aside, let's be clear on a couple things.",2

2024-09-23,"the 'big idea' of cigar butt investing article:how to get rich slowly and surely with value... there is a great deal of redundancy, me-tooism and superfluity in the provision of fund management, writes tim price at price value partners. there are too many funds out there versus legitimate investor demand. ('many are launched, but few are chosen.') more fund managers should be asked, 'what's your big idea?' this is an easy question to ask, but a tough question to answer briefly. the great value investor, benjamin graham, did a pretty good job of answering briefly when he wrote, in the very last chapter of 'the intelligent investor': ""confronted with a challenge to distil the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto: margin of safety."" those three words contain an entire universe of wisdom. safety, of course, means different things to different people. and these days, real safety is a tough thing to come by – it may even be impossible. nevertheless, here's our preferred definition. if we first define risk as the likelihood of incurring a permanent loss of capital – the complete and irreversible destruction of your pension fund, for example – then safety has to be the polar opposite. a 'safe' investment, or one approaching the characteristic of safety, is one that offers the least foreseeable likelihood of incurring a permanent loss of capital.",2
2024-09-23,"to go one stage further in the cause of total clarity, a 'safe' investment is one that also accords the investor a meaningful likelihood of retaining his or her purchasing power over the medium and longer term. a lot of things flow from these simple concepts. before we discovered benjamin graham, we stumbled upon daniel bernoulli. he popped up within the text of peter l.bernstein's 1998 book 'against the gods': a history of risk that we would recommend to any investment market 'completist'. bernoulli, an 18th century dutch mathematician and physicist, once remarked: ""the utility resulting from any small increase in wealth will be inversely proportionate to the quantity of goods previously possessed."" it's a rather dry-sounding statement, couched in very scientific, if not economist-like, language. but when we came across it in 1998 or 1999, while working for merrill lynch, it struck us like a lightning bolt. bear in mind that, at the time, the world and his wife were stampeding over themselves in their efforts to make obscene profits in internet stocks. our almost immediate response to bernoulli was to conclude that ""everyone else"" was doing it wrong. what would most matter to our clients, being either affluent, wealthy or very wealthy, would not be how much they might make on an investment – but how much they stood to lose.",2
2024-09-23,"it was during the first dotcom boom that we also came across the wonderful quote by lord overstone: ""no warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich."" the only real problem with benjamin graham's 'margin of safety' observation – and all that naturally flows from it – is that it's a 'get rich slow' or 'stay rich' approach. that may have limited appeal to those seeking a sudden and dramatic uptick in their fortunes. but we think every investor has to pursue an approach that sits easily with their own mental furniture. and we're happy to take a patient view of things. patience favours the 'margin of safety' investor. bernoulli's observation is probably a little closer to conventional wisdom now. it's difficult for us to say, because we've been living with a focus on absolute return investing for so long now it's difficult to remember having ever invested any other way. but we maintain that bernoulli still has a claim – among all his other achievements – to be one of the world's first behavioural economists. the likes of kahneman and tversky have more recently confirmed through extensive research the essential truth of what bernoulli said three centuries ago: human beings, and especially wealthy human beings, hate losing money far more than they enjoy making it. hence our focus, ever since discovering bernoulli, on absolute – as opposed to market-relative – investing. so this 'big idea' isn't just good for your portfolio, it's good for your psychological health, too.",2
2024-09-23,"like we say, this is genuinely a 'big idea' in every sense, because its implications are far-reaching and profound. let's drill a little deeper into some of the implications of 'margin of safety'. one of them is that equity investments, for example, can possess certain 'safe-ish' characteristics almost entirely independently of the sector they represent or the type of businesses they are. this is what warren buffett described as 'cigar butt' investments – shares of businesses that had perhaps one last puff in them but which were being given away for free. if you buy shares of any company when those shares are trading at a meaningful discount to that company's inherent worth / liquidation value / book value, then you don't even need to worry about the longer term prospects for that company; if it gets wound up, you still expect to make a profit. but 'cigar butt' (aka 'deep value') investing doesn't interest us so much, just as buffett himself moved on from it over the course of his career. value traps are still traps. instead, we're more interested in sustainable businesses with a history of superior shareholder returns and highly competent management – but only when the shares of those businesses happen to be on sale, for whatever reason. those last three words – ""for whatever reason"" – are also important.",2
2024-09-23,"because one thing that flows from the 'margin of safety' approach, at least from our perspective, is that price is far more important than any other subjective characteristic in an investment. price is in many respects the only thing that matters. a case in point. when we were buying certain mining and commodity company shares within our fund several years ago, a number of highly respected analysts at a data and news company that shall remain nameless (though it rhymes with 'roomberg') told us that we were mad. ""iron ore? oh, that sector's had it. the commodity boom is over."" if we had allowed ourselves to fall victim to a (wholly subjective) narrative about the commodities market at the time, we would never have made the investments in question, and we and our investors would have missed out on the double- and in some cases triple-digit returns that we subsequently enjoyed. in other words, so long as any company's underlying operations are sound, and ideally improving, and that company is making money whilst carrying little or no debt, a) it doesn't matter what the crowd thinks about that company or the sector it's in and b) it doesn't matter that its share price is temporarily under pressure. there may even be technical reasons for the share price to be lagging the rest of the market that have absolutely nothing to do with that company's underlying profitability or revenue growth.",2
2024-09-23,"it might be, for example, that a large fund just got hit with some heavy redemptions by clients, and is liquidating part of its portfolio, and shares of that company just happen to be among those being sold because they're more liquid than the fund's other holdings. the recent history of any company's share price tells you almost nothing about its underlying health – only about sentiment toward that company in the stock market. ben graham tended to focus on book value as the metric par excellence, but it's worth noting that book value today is somewhat less relevant than it was in a pre-internet, less technological age, when so many more businesses were involved in things like extractive industry or manufacturing. in a more services-driven world, book value struggles to give a fair reflection of the underlying worth of a business when the intangible value of so many companies, comprised of things like brand value and intellectual property, is so high. but there are plenty of other 'margin of safety' metrics we can use. here are a few others that we use in screening for stock selection: a minimum 10% cashflow from operations (cfo) yield cashflow from operations is the purest form of cash that a company can generate, because it isn't ""tainted"" by cashflow that can come about from either investment or financing – both of which can swing about wildly and be manipulated by management.",2
2024-09-23,"the cfo yield is calculated by dividing cash from operations by the total value of the company's debt and equity. a price / earnings (p/e) ratio of less than 15 times this is a classic ben graham metric. this can be calculated by dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share. clearly a number of companies will be excluded from any list selected by limiting the target p/e ratio, but who said you needed to own the whole market anyway? the 'margin of safety' investor is more focused, remember, on capital preservation – and owning growth stocks trading on high multiples is also risky, especially when a bull market goes into reverse. the fundamental beauty of a 'margin of safety' approach is that any investor who practises it never has to worry too much about the market turning, since he's primarily defensively positioned in the first place. a price / book ratio of less than 1.5x and, ideally, less than 1x. clearly, this can mean that one sometimes has to be patient. and in some cases, some companies may never trade below book value. but the important thing is that a focus on a low price / book ratio means that the cautious investor never wildly overpays for anything. a debt / total assets ratio of less than 30% one of the killers of any company is being overly indebted. consider poor old thomas cook.",2
2024-09-23,"here is what seasoned japan equity analyst john seagrim wrote as the company crashed some time ago: ""for twelve years now thomas cook has not only been blithely sending holiday makers abroad with absolutely no tangible balance sheet protection at all, but with an ever growing tangible black hole in its fuselage – in the last 12 years that tangible black hole has widened 8 fold from minus £413ml to minus £3.3bn! ""i suppose thomas cook's thinking was, who needs tangible book when all we do is flog european package holidays to those who don't appear to much like the europeans, which was sort of fine as long as long as the weather wasn't – last year thomas cook cited a 'prolonged period of hot weather' (it's called 'summer') as the reason for their dire 2018 performance. ""one could feel sorry for this (in)famous package holiday pedlar, but all sympathy evaporates when one sees the returns package that accompanied their performance.‎ despite generating a cumulative 12 year net loss of £2.685bn – thomas cook generously dished out £366ml in dividends and fished out £300ml in buy backs (but then had to ask for most of it back again with a £400ml rights issue 6 years ago), not to mention ceo fankhauser's generous 'return package' of £8.3ml over the last five years. ""the upshot or downshot of this improvidence is that 150,000 stranded brits now have to be rescued and brought back to borisland – an evacuation, the scale of which has not been seen since what was left of the british expeditionary force found themselves on the beaches of dunkirk in may 1940. ""call me old fashioned but i don't much care for this capitalism without capital thing, i prefer balance sheets stuffed full of tangible equity not ethereal intangibles like illwill (thomas cook has £2.6bn of so called goodwill (in reality 'illwill') on its balance sheet, which until this year gave it an illusorily positive book value).",2

2024-09-20,"tariff stupidity: lessons from history article:stupid us history specifically... most aspects of bad economic nationalism have to do with tariffs, writes nathan lewis on his new world economics blog. tariffs were a core component of tax systems in the past, whether the federal government of the 19th century, or the british government of centuries prior to that. their important revenue role was largely surpassed by the development of alternative taxes, in particular the income tax (1842 in britain), the retail sales tax, and the vat. you might also include the payroll tax, although that is typically conceived as a direct funding mechanism for socialistic programs such as social security, rather than as some funding alternative to tariffs. tariffs have been part of some pretty big disasters over the years, so let's look at what they were. in us history, the biggest disasters were the civil war and great depression, both of which had tariffs as a core component. these days, there is a certain group of southern intellectuals that perhaps want to overstate the importance of tariffs in the outbreak of the civil war. let's be clear: i think the main reason for the secession of the southern states, and consequently the civil war, was not tariffs, but of course slavery, in particular the question of the expansion of slavery in new states beyond the original 13 colonies, that took place in 1789-1860.",2
2024-09-20,"in the original constitution, a compromise was enacted where importation of new slaves would be eliminated in twenty years, or 1808. at the time of the signing of the constitution, it was thought that this would lead to the eventual elimination of slavery entirely. however, it didn't work out that way. slavery continued after 1808, and actually expanded in the original southern states. from 1.2 million slaves in 1810, there were 4.0 million in 1860. then, the addition of new states also brought with it the expansion of slavery beyond the original southern colonies. this was a disaster. it led to the creation of the republican party to stop it, and abraham lincoln as president, who came to prominence in the lincoln/douglas debates, regarding slavery in the new states. not tariffs. you can read about it in any decent volume of american history. since most general books of american history these days are pretty suspect, or are outright garbage, i recommend only two: a history of the american people, by paul johnson; and a patriot's history of the united states, by schweikart and allen. most histories from before 1910 will be good too. but tariffs nevertheless played a part in the civil war. lincoln's electoral victory was not only a major step forward for blocking the expansion of slavery in the new states, it also made certain the passage of the morrill tariff, an increase on tariffs, which was passed in march 1861, immediately upon lincoln's inauguration.",2
2024-09-20,"lincoln passed two more tariff increases during his term, largely to finance the war. after the southern states seceded and declared themselves independent, there was a sort of standoff. the southern states naturally didn't want war with the union if they could avoid it. peaceful secession worked for them. the union didn't recognize the secession, but they didn't do much about it, at first. the flashpoint, as we know, was an attack at fort sumter, in south carolina. why south carolina? this was nowhere near the north/south border. why fort sumter? fort sumter was a fort built on an artificial island, in the harbor of charleston. it was a federal military post, and controlled ship travel through charleston. one of its purposes was to enforce the collection of federal tariffs, on trade through charleston. since the federal government didn't recognize southern secession, naturally it continued to oversee ship trade, including the collection of federal tariffs. tariffs on manufactured goods mostly advantaged northern manufacturing interests. they were able to charge higher prices on customers in the south, being protected from lower-cost foreign competition. southern businesses were mostly engaged in agricultural production (chiefly cotton), which they exported to other countries via harbors such as charleston. the federal government of course did not charge tariffs on exports.",2
2024-09-20,"but, other countries, facing federal tariffs on exports of their goods to the united states, naturally reacted with tariffs on us imports, primarily cotton. a southern exporter might naturally see a european cotton tariff as a consequence of us import tariffs – especially since the european governments probably stated explicitly this was so. it is an exaggeration to say that the great depression was caused by the smoot-hawley tariff of 1930, which gained a majority in congress in september 1929, thus facilitating its passage. by itself, it would have probably led to a recession, but not a great depression. but it inspired a worldwide burst of retaliatory tariffs, inflaming a worldwide trade war. in the economic downturn that followed, mostly conservative governments worldwide, facing a falloff in tax revenue, reacted with a burst of domestic spending combined with a burst of higher domestic taxes to pay for it. this in turn led to an explosion of monetary chaos with the british devaluation of september 1931, and destructive socialistic attempts to deal with the disaster, such as roosevelt's national industrial recovery act of 1933. what a catastrophe. and, the initial error, that brought to an end the amazing 1920s technological expansion, was tariff stupidity. one reason for the republicans' embrace of the smoot-hawley tariff was the notion that a higher tariff was good for business.",2
2024-09-20,"it obviously worked as a protection for us businesses; although customers of those business would likely face higher prices. but, the retaliatory tariffs worldwide were certainly bad for us exporters. with tariffs involved in two of the biggest disasters in us history, and indeed the whole world regretting its tariff warfare and endeavoring, in the world economic conference of 1933, to reduce tariffs worldwide and return to something like a pre-1929 status quo, tariffs became the third rail of us economic policy and even worldwide economic policy. a trend toward free trade began at the bretton woods conference in 1944 (which included a plan for an international trade organization to prevent the kind of retaliatory trade war that everyone then knew had caused all kinds of problems), and which continued in various forms afterwards. to these historic disasters, we can add the day-to-day complexity and difficulty of administering hundreds of tariffs, at different rates. each tariff, and each rate, became a topic of political contention, not only involving congress, but also foreign governments and the diplomatic service. it was tolerable – arguably – when, in the primitive state of mid-19th century taxation, there didn't seem to be much alternative. but in the 20th century, as tariffs became a negligible revenue source, all this excess complexity and contention became a needless burden, a swamp of difficulty to be avoided via broad free trade agreements, and the like.",2

2024-09-18,"gold miners 'cheap' vs. gold prices article:record bullion prices leave mining stocks behind... for seasoned gold mining investors, the precious metal's move above $2500 should be a moment of validation, says frank holmes at us global investors. after all, the yellow metal has long been seen as the ultimate hedge against economic uncertainty. and yet, despite the bull run, gold stocks – those companies that mine, process and sell the metal – are trading at historically low valuations relative to the market. this apparent disconnect offers contrarian investors an extraordinary opportunity. but first, why is this happening? the primary culprit for this disparity, i believe, lies in the impact of interest rates and central banks' gold-buying spree. the real, inflation-protected 10-year treasury yield rose from a low of around -1.2% in august 2021 to nearly 2.5% in october 2023, and for many investors, particularly those in western countries, rising yields are a signal to sell non-interest-bearing gold. that's exactly what happened. from the end of 2020 to may 2024, exchange-traded funds (etfs) backed by physical gold shed approximately 30 million ounces, over a quarter of their total holdings, as yield-seeking investors pared back their positions. what some investors may have overlooked, i'm afraid, is the long-term potential of the very assets they were letting go of.",2
2024-09-18,"gold stocks, unlike the physical metal, offer not just a hedge but also a means of participating in the upside of gold prices. put another way, when gold prices have gone up, gold stocks have historically tended to rise even more. right now, i believe these stocks are offering an unprecedented combination of low valuations and high potential returns. as contrarians, we understand that the best time to invest is often when sentiment is at its lowest. and sentiment around gold equities is pretty low right now. but history tells us that this could be the perfect time to buy. as you may be able to tell in the chart above, we're seeing a reversal of the gold etf selloff. since mid-may, investors have added about 2.3 million ounces of gold, according to bloomberg data; holdings now stand at their highest level since february of this year. this could be just the beginning. if real interest fall substantially, the tide could turn in favor of gold and gold equities. historically, gold's biggest gains have occurred when the federal reserve cuts interest rates amid economic uncertainty. although there's no obvious crisis on the horizon, markets are pricing in a cut at each of the next three fed meetings in september, november and december. if the fed follows through, we could see gold prices not only maintain their current levels but soar to new heights. ubs is calling for $2700 gold by mid-2025; citigroup, goldman sachs and bank of america all see the metal hitting $3000.",2

2024-09-17,"those bullish bets that gold is going to continue going up will force banks and brokerages to buy gld shares, covering their exposure from taking the other side of their clients' wagers. that will lead the gld to issue more shares, needing more bullion to back them. and since the start of july – as bullion and gold etf prices have accelerated amid a surge of bullish betting on gold-related derivatives – the gld has accounted for 84% of net inflows to north american gold etfs. that's sharply greater than the fund's underlying position within that group, where it accounts for 54% by size. gld inflows are also running sharply ahead of their global weighting, accounting for a massive 42% of gold etf growth worldwide over the past 11 weeks while accounting for only 27% of the sector's size overall. as for bullionvault... ...the world's largest marketplace for private investors to trade and own securely stored precious metals... ...users continue to take profit net-net, seizing on gold's latest record-high prices to bank some or more of their gains and edge down the quantity of gold they own in specialist vaults in london, new york, singapore, toronto and zurich. and why not? the value of those holdings, after all, keeps going up to new records, now rising above $3.6 billion thanks to gold's bull market. this isn't new however. gold buying across the world often retreats in the face of rising gold prices.",0

2024-09-16,"for several reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, i expect a tragic ending to the stock market arm of the ""everything bubble"" instigated by hyper-easy policy. anything correlated positively with it is likely to be vulnerable when the machines, quants and multitudes of wise guys start selling in unison, just as they buy in unison today. oh, and don't forget the margin man. he will want his due, and he won't care what you have to liquidate to get it. but on the big picture, the much bemoaned hui/gold ratio (hgr) as been a righteous indicator of a generally poor gold mining fundamental backdrop. its 20-year decline was logical, and you should not let belly aching and excuse making influence you otherwise. but thus far the gold mining rally is valid by this important internal indicator. i expect the hgr to continue leading into whatever top is out ahead. longer-term, after a deflationary liquidation clears the macro, a new bull market in this internal indicator may even ensue. consider joining nftrh, which has been right on the mark since effectively managing the 2020 crash, the inflationary recovery from that crash, and most recently managing the ""new macro"" picture and the current goldilocks/disinflation situation within it. actually, on the big picture we've been in step with the markets analytically, since inception right into the jaws of the oncoming market crash in q4 2008. one thing is for sure.",0
2024-09-16,"we need to manage modern markets with an independent mindset and not follow stale and debunked theories about why the gold stock sector ""should have been"" bullish. the hui/gold ratio was not wrong. it was very right. if your assumptions are wrong, then your entire analytical framework is built on an error. and the assumption that cyclical inflation was going to bull gold stocks was a pervasive, destructive and ongoing error. the current trade is already quite profitable, but when it ends it will likely end in rude fashion, if current trends and market correlations remain intact. then, amid deflationary fears upon the macro, the average gold stock trader will not be buying the destruction. but that will be the time to position for a longer-term bull phase. that could be years out from here. meanwhile, let's enjoy the current trade, but also understand it for what it is, a cyclical bull phase against improving fundamentals with one nagging issue, a currently positive correlation to high risk cyclical markets (again, to talk my book, i have several positions in those markets as well, as we manage the perhaps final stages of the broad bull).",0
2024-09-14,"us recession warnings multiply article:fed rate cuts can't start soon enough... the u.s. economy could be heading into choppy waters, and investors may be wise to buckle up, says frank holmes at us global investors. recent data suggest that storm clouds could be gathering, with declines in us manufacturing, a softening labor market and worrisome signs from the bond market all pointing to possible trouble ahead. manufacturing production signaled a significant weakening in demand in august. the s&p global us manufacturing pmi posted a reading of 47.9, its lowest level in 2024 so far. any pmi below 50 indicates contraction, and this is now the second consecutive month of declines. weakness in manufacturing isn't just a concern for the stock market. the industry is contracting at a time when kamala harris, the incumbent-party presidential candidate, is hoping to run on the administration's economic success. if harris takes office at a time when the business cycle is faltering, she'll face an uphill battle with a slowing jobs market, lagging home sales and a federal reserve caught between a rock and a hard place on interest rates. geopolitical risks also continue to swirl in the background, creating even more uncertainty. but the us isn't alone in this struggle. in august, the j.p.morgan global manufacturing pmi fell to 49.5, an eight-month low. out of 31 countries surveyed, 18 showed deterioration in manufacturing conditions, including those in the euro area and japan.",0
2024-09-14,"the slowdown isn't confined to our shores – it's a global issue that could have ripple effects on trade, jobs and investment opportunities. the us labor market has long been a source of strength for the economy, but it, too, is starting to send worrying signals. august's jobs report was underwhelming, and while the unemployment rate is still relatively low, the trend is going in the wrong direction. in july, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, which triggered what's known as the sahm rule, a little-known but highly accurate recession indicator named after former fed economist claudia sahm. the rule has successfully predicted every us recession since 1970, so when it's activated, people take notice. payroll gains have also slowed over the past several months, and many economists expect that we'll see downward revisions in the number of jobs added. all of this is happening as inflation remains a persistent thorn in the side of policymakers, complicating the fed's job as it tries to balance controlling prices with avoiding a deeper slowdown in the economy.",0
2024-09-14,"sahm herself has expressed concern that the fed might not be acting quickly enough to avoid a recession. ""the fed can no longer afford to move gradually,"" she said recently in an interview with goldman sachs. ""twenty-five basis point cuts would probably suffice to avoid the worst possible economic outcomes, but these cuts have to be delivered decisively, not gradually."" one of the most reliable recession indicators over the last 50 years has been the yield curve, and last week, it turned positive again for the first time in over two years. an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, has preceded every us recession since the 1970s. this occurs because market participants, anticipating future rate cuts to combat a downturn, drive long-term rates lower. typically, the spread between the 10-year and two-year treasury notes is used to gauge this inversion. before last week, the yield curve had been inverted for a staggering 783 consecutive days, the longest such period in us history. although the inversion has recently ""uninverted"", meaning long-term rates are no longer lower than short-term rates, the damage may already be done. historically, there's been about a 12-month lag on average between the first inversion and the onset of a recession. but this can vary. for instance, the curve first inverted in january 2006, roughly two years before the financial crisis began in 2008.",0
2024-09-14,"if history is any guide, the prolonged inversion we just experienced could be setting the stage for another economic downturn. what does all this mean for investors? according to peter berezin, director of research at bca, it may be time to rethink your portfolio strategy. writing in the financial times, berezin says that now may be the moment to rotate out of stocks and into bonds. for the last two years, stocks have been the place to be, but with a recession potentially on its way, berezin believes bonds will soon offer a better risk-reward balance. in a recessionary scenario, berezin expects the s&p 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio to fall from 21 to 16, with earnings estimates dropping by 10%. this would bring the s&p down to 3,800 – an almost 30% decline from current levels. it's a sobering prediction, but one that can't be ignored, especially given the headwinds facing the global economy. the federal reserve has been in a rate-hiking cycle for over two years now, but with economic data weakening, many expect that rate cuts are on the horizon. the first cut is anticipated to come at the september 17-18 fomc meeting, with a reduction of 0.25% to 0.50%. while some might hope that this will stave off a recession, it's important to remember that rate cuts take time to filter through the economy. there's also the risk that the fed could be too slow in its actions. sahm, berezin and others argue that decisive cuts may be necessary to avoid the worst outcomes.",0
2024-09-14,"the longer the fed waits, the harder it will be to reverse the course of a slowing economy. as always, i remain optimistic about the long-term potential of the us economy, but the short-term outlook is uncertain. now may be the time to reexamine your portfolio and prepare for the possibility of a slowdown. history shows that recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle, but they can also present opportunities for savvy investors who are prepared. stay focused, stay informed and as always, happy investing!",0

2024-09-10,"joined at the hip? gold's correlation with s&p500 hits 4-decade high article:price of gold and us stocks set new all-time highs ahead of the fed... the price of gold is famously uncorrelated with the stock market, offering investors a simple way to diversify an equity portfolio by adding a little bullion to help spread their risk, writes adrian ash at bullionvault. but that non-correlation – meaning that gold shows no relationship with the stock market, moving neither together with nor against the direction of equity prices over longer time frames – only works as an average. at any point in time, gold tends to be either negatively correlated against the direction of equity prices – a negative gold correlation often seen when the stock market slumps – or positively correlated with it. and at the start of september, the price of gold in us dollars was more positively correlated with the us stock market than almost any time in 4 decades on a 1-month basis, and more closely connected on a 1-year basis than any time since spring 2011. here comes the science...! measured on the 'r' coefficient of day-to-day movements over a 1-month period, gold began september with a correlation of +0.945 against the s&p500 index. this was the most positive 1-month relationship since february 2010 (when it read +0.947) and close to the strongest link since september 1982 (+0.966).",0
2024-09-10,"that number would read +1.000 if gold and the stock market were moving absolutely in lock-step with each other, or minus 1.000 if they moved exactly opposite day by day. over the past half-a-century, the 1-month correlation has averaged +0.004. gold has also become extremely correlated with us stocks on a 12-month basis, with that 'r' coefficient reaching +0.897. that's close to the top 1% of all 365-day readings over the past half-a-century, and it's the most positive connection since mid-may 2011. again, this longer-term relationship averages near to zero (+0.020 since 1969). so gold and the stock market will need to diverge at some point, to help the long-term average remain close to zero. this is already happening on the 1-month correlation of gold and the stock market, and it fell to +0.693 at the start of this week. but the 1-year relationship is less volatile, and correlations as extreme or stronger than today have a tendency to run for extended periods of time... ...34 trading days in a row in spring 2010, for instance, or 25 days in spring 2004 and 67 days in mid-1971. so far in autumn 2024, it has run this high for only 9 trading days in a row so far. so for better or for worse, next week's federal reserve decision and forecast for us interest rates will very likely see the underlying direction of gold and the stock market remain joined at the hip for a few more days if not months to come.",0
2024-09-10,"of course, both equities and the price of gold have since last summer shrugged off the highest interest rates in two decades. they have now jumped to new all-time highs in anticipation of the fed finally joining new zealand, canada, the ecb and bank of england in starting to cut the cost of borrowing from next week. but while a quarter-point cut is now the consensus prediction for the fed's september decision, both assets could suffer a pullback if the us central bank's new forecasts for how deeply it will cut rates by christmas and in 2025 then disappoint market expectations. those expectations currently foresee the fed's key interest rate standing at 4.3% by the end of 2024 and just 2.9% by end-2025. but the central bank's policy team itself forecast 5.1% and 4.1% in their june 'dot plots', raising both predictions from the outlook they gave in march at 4.6% and 3.9%. so there's scope for disappointment in both the stock market and gold around next wednesday's new fed forecasts. not least because everyone – and i mean everyone in gold-market analysis and punditry – is now shout-out-loud bullish gold because of the fed rate cut now guaranteed to arrive on 18 september. but beyond that? any pullback is likely to find a warm welcome among private investors, offsetting the caution in gold demand caused by the past year's mix of high prices and high interest rates.",0

""the drive for profits by wall street and the mutual fund industry overwhelms the concept of fiduciary responsibility, leading to an all too predictable outcome: except in an inconsequential number of cases where individuals succeed through unusual skill or unreliable luck, the powerful financial services industry exploits vulnerable individual investors."" the nature of ownership is crucial to the likely end return. to swensen, ""the ownership structure of a fund management company plays a role in determining the likelihood of investor success. mutual fund investors face the greatest challenge with investment management companies that provide returns to public shareholders or that funnel profits to a corporate parent – situations that place the conflict between profit generation and fiduciary responsibility in high relief.

2024-09-05,"peak nvidia? article:how all bubbles end in the end... remember the stock market's mini-crash of 5th august? asks jim rickards in the daily reckoning, writing shortly before last week's quarterly earnings report from ai chip giant nvidia. well, investors apparently don't. that plunge seems like a distant memory at this point, as the ""buy the dip"" theme is a deeply entrenched force in today's market. well, i'm afraid they could be about to get a stark reminder. only this time, it'll be far worse. first off, why are stocks going up? the simple answer is that the market's in a bubble. there are a couple of things to consider. the s&p 500 is really the s&p four, meaning it's a cap-weighted index. that means that the impact of a stock's price on the index is a function of its market capitalization. the bigger its market cap, the greater its impact on the index. right now, the top 10 stocks in the s&p account for about 30% of the index. and it's just a small handful of stocks like apple, microsoft, nvidia, google (alphabet) and a couple of others that account for most of the market's gains this year. if you actually take the 500 stocks in the s&p 500 (503 to be precise), more of them are down this year than are up. so when you say the s&p is up 18% on the year, it presents a very distorted picture. nvidia has been the market's leading performer, partly because of the latest market fad concerning artificial intelligence (ai) and gpt (generative pre-trained transformers).",2
2024-09-05,"the ai boom has created hand-over-fist demand for nvidia's chips. do the people buying these stocks actually know what gpt is? no, most don't. but they don't want to miss the nvidia gravy train. people buy into the hype because they don't want to miss out on the next big thing. and so they buy the stock. that drives the stock higher, which attracts more buyers, which drives the price even higher, which attracts even more buyers. it's a positive feedback loop. we're now in that feedback loop. it's amplified by institutional investors. large index funds like vanguard, state street, fidelity and some others have loaded up on nvidia stock. what happens when they buy nvidia? the stock price goes up. then what happens? they buy more nvidia stock because it has an even larger place in the index. so it's a process that feeds on itself. and it can go on for a long time. that's how bubbles form. how does it end? well, it ends with a crash eventually. the music can't keep playing forever. the question then becomes when exactly is the music going to stop playing? it can be a difficult question to answer. you know it's a bubble, even if you don't know when it'll pop. you know it will, but you usually don't know the specific catalyst that will set the crash in motion. often, the catalyst is only obvious in retrospect. the first factor to consider about nvidia is that its valuation is absolutely sky-high.",2

2024-09-05,"meanwhile, nivida's chips are very expensive, and they require a lot of energy which also costs a lot. so by shifting to building their own in-house chips, these big tech companies are reducing their costs, and becoming independent of nvidia. but nvidia stock is basically ""priced for perfection"". the problem is when people expect perfection, anything less than perfect is bad news. disappointment could trigger a massive market chain reaction, potentially leading to losses of 30%, 50% and even 80% among some of the biggest tech stocks that have been driving the market. if it happens, the major stock market indexes are going to get clobbered. it won't be the end of the world, i want to be clear about that. but the market could take a long time to recover. which snowflake will trigger this avalanche? a massive amount of snow can accumulate before that one final snowflake comes along to start the chain reaction. the way to think about it is that the triggering snowflake might not look much different from the harmless snowflake that preceded it. it's just that it hit the system at the wrong time, at the wrong place. there's a lot of snow built up on this mountain. nvidia could potentially be the snowflake that triggers an avalanche. i'm not telling you to panic, but i do want you to be prepared for a possible avalanche. if it doesn't happen, that's great, you can get on the ski lift and take another run down the mountain.",2

2024-09-04,"most economists agree that price controls are not the answer. according to regular surveys conducted by the chicago booth school, a majority of economists do not believe that price controls could effectively limit us inflation over the course of a year. in a july survey, three quarters of economists either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that capping rent hikes at 5% annually would help americans over the long run. similarly, an overwhelming 62% either agreed or strongly agreed that controlling price increases would lead to ""substantial"" supply shortages. we don't have to look very far back in us history to see the dangers of price controls. in august 1971, president richard nixon imposed a 90-day freeze on all prices and wages in the united states. at first, the move was popular, giving nixon a boost in his re-election bid the following year. but the initial success was short-lived. nixon's plan contributed to a decade of stagflation – a toxic mix of high inflation and slow growth that eroded living standards for millions of americans. it wasn't until 1983, midway through ronald reagan's first term as president, that the economy finally began to recover. in a radio address in october of that year, reagan pointed to ""solid evidence that america has turned the corner toward long-term economic expansion."" the lesson is clear: price controls are not a sustainable solution. they distort market signals, leading to inefficiencies and economic stagnation.",2
2024-09-04,"remember, prices serve as marketplace indicators. high prices might be frustrating for consumers, but they send an important message to producers: there's profit to be made here, so invest more. for consumers, high prices signal scarcity, which encourages them to use resources more wisely. take gasoline as an example. if gas were to soar to $5 a gallon, people would probably cut back on non-essential driving. meanwhile, the high price would encourage oil companies to ramp up production, which would eventually lead to lower prices. but what if the government artificially capped gas at, say, $2 a gallon? it would send the wrong signals to both consumers and producers. consumers would drive just as much as before, if not more, exacerbating the scarcity, while producers would have less incentive to increase supply. this could lead to even higher prices down the road or, worse, 1970s-style gas shortages. harris's support for a tax on unrealized gains would also have far-reaching consequences for the us economy. as i've said before, taxing gains on assets you haven't sold yet is not just absurd, it's dangerous. it's a policy that would drive capital out of the country at an unprecedented rate, leading to a loss of tax revenue and a weakening of our financial system. we're already seeing a mass exodus of wealth from high-tax states like new york and california to more tax-friendly states like florida and texas. but this trend is not limited to the usa.",2
2024-09-04,"globally, the movement of millionaires from countries with burdensome tax policies to more welcoming environments is accelerating. according to the henley private wealth migration report, an estimated 128,000 millionaires are expected to relocate this year, surpassing the previous record set in 2023. the united arab emirates (uae) ranks first in attracting this wealth by offering a business-friendly environment and luxurious living conditions. conversely, countries like china and the united kingdom are facing significant outflows of high-net-worth individuals (hnwis) due to slowing growth, geopolitical tensions and unfavorable tax regimes. the implications of this ""great millionaire migration"" are profound. wealthy individuals contribute significantly to the tax base, and their departure can cripple a nation's finances. the economic policies vice president harris supports – price controls and the taxation of unrealized gains – are misguided at best and catastrophic at worst. as history has shown us, these measures disrupt market forces, stifle economic growth and can lead to financial crises. if we want to preserve america's prosperity, we must resist these flawed policies and instead embrace the principles of free markets and limited government intervention. the stakes are too high to do otherwise.",2

2024-08-21,"get ready for a real recession article:how to survive the great unwinding...? let's start with three stipulations, writes charles hugh smith on his oftwominds blog, reposting at addison wiggin's daily reckoning. first, this is not investment advice; everything here is an observation based on history or my personal experiences after previous bubbles have popped second, there are no easy answers – none. third, my last three books can be viewed as a trilogy describing macro and individual responses to the great unwinding. do i have all the answers? no. nobody does. all we can assemble is a coherent response based on the lessons of history and system dynamics: what's fragile, risky and undependable and what's lower risk and more resilient. since no response is easy, we're talking about degrees of difficulty and what's within reach for each of us. we all have limits of experience, location, skills, capital, networks and so on. therefore there's no ""one size fits all"" template that's going to work for everyone. the whole point of my book on self-reliance is that we each have to plan our own responses; we can't just follow somebody else's plan. there's a great divide between what americans want/expect and what's realistic. the average american feels they need to earn over $180,000 to live comfortably, according to a recent survey. the survey also found that only 6% of us adults make $186,000 or more, while the median family income is between $51,500 and $86,000.",0
2024-08-21,"in other words, everyone feels they'd be ok if they joined the top 6%, meanwhile those households earning $180,000 are feeling that they need to earn $300,000 to be comfortable. if you and your spouse/partner can skim off $300,000 or more annually, go for it. in terms of risk management, it might be prudent to assume one of you loses your job at some point, so figuring out how to live on $100,000 now rather than later makes sense. many readers report that they've already fashioned a low-cost, resilient lifestyle, generally by living in a lower cost rural locale with cheaper housing, paying off debt, doing their own repairs and maintenance on homes and vehicles, growing some of their own food and finding like-minded people in the community to share/work with. establishing a low-cost lifestyle demands sacrifices, many of which are ""impossible"" or out of reach in the current zeitgeist: the jobs and excitement are in cities and suburbs that are unaffordable. learning how to repair, maintain, grow, cook, bake and build also takes time, effort and sacrifice. the transition from consumer to producer is not easy. it's been a long time since americans experienced a ""real recession."" the last ""real recession"" was in 1981-82, over 40 years ago. since then, recessions have been brief due to unprecedented bailouts and stimulus. the returns on bailouts and stimulus have diminished, and expecting the same tricks to work like magic again is, well, magical thinking.",0

2024-08-19,"things to know about gold article:4 key takeaways on natural resources... i recently attended the annual rick rule resource conference in boca raton, florida, writes byron king in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. who doesn't want to swelter in 95-degree temps in the shade and 95% humidity? then again, and as an old friend – a rompin', stompin' retired navy seal – says, ""there's no bad weather, only inappropriate clothing and poor preparation."" no need to fret, though. it was all okay because the heat and humidity were outside, while we were inside a superb venue with excellent air conditioning and many other great amenities. and c'mon; hot weather or no, i was there to learn, and learn i did. because rick puts on one of the best resource-focused conferences you'll find anywhere. this recent event was four solid days of deep dives into junior and intermediate-scale resource companies, particularly gold and silver, royalty ideas and the fast-evolving world of copper. let's look at four key takeaways. day one began with an insightful talk about gold by dana samuelson, president of the american gold exchange of austin, texas. he runs a sizable operation, and when you sell hundreds of millions of dollars in gold and silver coins and bullion, you tend to know things.",0
2024-08-19,"first, per dana, ""beware of fake gold."" that is, dana is a certified numismatist who has served for many years as an expert witness in litigation over quality and purity disputes, as well as for the us government in fraud and other criminal prosecutions. dana's point was that with rising gold prices, the market has attracted fraudsters. incidents are rising of coins and metal bars that are not what they purport to be. with ingots and even some coins, gold and silver may be alloyed down in purity. you can only tell with sensitive measuring techniques. in extreme cases, a so-called ""gold"" bar may be nothing more than a gold veneer over a mass of far less valuable tungsten. and more than a few coins for sale on websites may also be counterfeit, even ones inside those impressive-looking plastic slabs. this is not a reason not to buy physical coins and ingots, etc. but it is a caution to be careful and judicious with whom you deal. dana's advice is to buy from established, reputable dealers. you should ask about the background of the people on staff, particularly what's their expertise in the field, as well as what testing equipment and method they utilize to ensure the fineness of the metal offered for sale. and one final point: if or when the time comes to sell a coin or metal ingot, it helps to go to the dealer from whom you bought it in the first place. good dealers ought to be willing to buy back what they sold you, allowing for price changes.",0
2024-08-19,"and it's not hard to understand that many dealers don't want to buy products that they never carried or sold in the first place, like many specialty coins. dana also offered solid insights into the current worldwide demand for gold. in essence, central bank gold buying has soared in the past two years, while investment demand for gold from asia is way up as well. as for central banks, the historical trend is that about 15% of total annual global gold output from mines has gone into central bank vaults; but in the past two years, since mid-2022, that number has more than doubled. in fact, right now about a third of the annual global gold mine output is being purchased by central banks. this alone is a major change in the supply-demand dynamics of the metal. it's not hard to understand why central banks have increased their gold buying. it's directly traceable to western sanctions on russia over the ukraine military operation which commenced in february 2022. shortly thereafter, the us and western allies froze about $350 billion in russian-owned us treasury securities; that is, state assets of the russian federation. another way to say it is that the us and western partners confiscated russian state funds, and this sent shock waves across the world. if the us can freeze the assets of a nuclear power like russia, what chance does anyone else have if politicians and bureaucrats in washington decide to pull a money grab?",0
2024-08-19,"the immediate and most effective means to protect assets is to de-dollarize by selling off us treasuries and use the proceeds to buy physical gold. at least then central banks can control their own fate via hard assets and avoid counterparty risk. meanwhile in asia – mostly china, but many other nations as well – investors are buying more and more physical gold and silver. the idea is to transfer funds out of depreciating local currencies, and at the same time avoid the traceability that comes with something like buying us treasuries. meanwhile, gold is a hedge against inflation both in local currency as well as with us dollars. up and down the line, asian gold buying is strong. purchasers range from individual investors to family offices, banks, businesses and even governments, plus the above-noted central banks. right now, considering the current world situation, people and institutions in many places wish to avoid local currencies and even dollars and accumulate an immutable asset with the capability to protect wealth across years and even generations. hence the trend toward gold buying. with rising gold prices, one part of the sector has done quite well, namely royalty companies. these are not mining plays, though; they're more like specialized bankers to the mining industry. and when gold prices rise, shares in royalty plays tend to move early and fast. here's how it works.",0
2024-08-19,"let's say that an exploration or development project is proceeding apace out in the field, but the company needs cash. management can issue new shares, but that dilutes existing shareholders. and most commercial banks won't lend at decent terms to a project that isn't producing gold or cash flow. so along come royalty companies with a business model designed to advance funds into a project in return for a future payout, or even a stream of actual metal, when the project goes into production. there's much geological thinking, engineering and solid banking involved in the business, and every deal is different. but the idea is that the royalty company puts money into a project in the early days, and then benefits long afterward from its foresight and patience. one great advantage of the royalty model is that the company avoids most day-to-day issues of running a mine. royalty companies generally don't worry too much about the price of diesel fuel, or labor issues, or the logistics of operations or much more. they put their funds into play with the project operator, and then after a while collect a payout on the backend. anyway, it's a potentially lucrative option you might want to consider if you want exposure to the precious metals market.",0

""there are multiple reasons why beginners should consider investing in the metal as soon as this week,"" we are informed. cbs news proceeds to cite the three central reasons. reasons one: ""with many experts predicting a price of $3000 per ounce shortly, now is the time to buy in while it's still affordable. if you wait, you could miss out on the portfolio protection a gold investment can provide. and the price could rise within days."" reasons two: ""while a reduction in the federal funds rate [didn't occur last month], the fed [gave] greater insight into their decision-making process and the chances of a rate cut to come in september when they meet again... ""in this scenario, more investors may turn to gold for protection, causing the price to rise."" more investors have evidently turned to gold for protection, causing the price to rise. its price skyshot higher after the fed's 'no change' decision at its most recent meeting. the betting market presently gives 100% odds of a september rate reduction.",0
2024-08-14,"reasons three: ""a changing inflation rate and what many expect to soon be a lower interest rate climate may soon combine to affect your portfolio, perhaps significantly...a diversified portfolio can help take advantage of some volatility, such as those offered by stocks and bonds, while still offering some protection against larger economic concerns. ""gold can adequately perform the latter function, especially if it's done in the form of 10% or less of your overall portfolio."" perhaps cbs news is at last heeding the counsel of jim rickards. it is unlikely – yet we must consider the possibility. jim believes gold is destined not merely for $3000 or $5,000 or even $10,000. jim believes gold is destined ultimately for $15,000. here is why 'bond king' jeffrey gundlach believes investors are herding into gold: ""i think there is just growing awareness that developed country governments are completely out of control. ""i feel like the average person is starting to realize the gravity of this problem...that we are running on a debt-based scheme with no end in sight. and i just think that people are starting to think that 'maybe i should own...real money'."" we hazard there is justice here. what stands behind the dollar? ultimately, the word of the united states government. that is, nothing stands behind the dollar. if you seek a substance behind it you will not find one. it is not there. and it is increasingly evident to those with eyes to see it. hence the hunger for ""real money"".",0

2024-08-01,"that '70s show, again article:stagflation, political violence, wealth inequality... are we going to be reliving the 1970s? asks charles hugh smith of the oftwominds blog writing for addison wiggin's daily reckoning. perhaps we will experience the stagflation of the 1970s in this decade, as financial excesses are worked out and monumental investments to retool our industrial base and infrastructure place a drag on productivity and profits. there is substantial logic in that scenario. stagflation also crushed the stock market's speculative dynamic. in the financial realm, that '70s show was characterized by a massive devaluation of the purchasing power of stocks as a result of elevated inflation and an equally massive decay in the speculative impulse to play the stock market, as the percentage of household assets in the stock market fell from 38% to 14%. but what we might experience in addition to stagflation is something few seem to recall about the 1970s: the extraordinary unpredictability of events and crises. consider the situation in april 1973, at the start of president nixon's second term. inflation had flared up, a currency crisis loomed and nixon had issued sweeping policy changes in august 1971 ending the convertibility of the us dollar to gold in international markets and imposing wage and price controls. the general outlook in early 1973 was positive, and the dow jones industrial average (djia) topped 1,000 again, reaching a new nominal high.",1
2024-08-01,"if any seer predicted the oil embargo/gas crisis that pushed americans into long lines around gas stations in october 1973, or the watergate cover-up leading to nixon's resignation in august 1974 or the attempt on president ford's life in september 1975, they're unknown to the world. if anyone predicted a decade of anti-establishment domestic terrorism, their prediction is lost to history. the hundreds of bombings of corporate america buildings, banks and other symbolic fortresses of the establishment have been ably documented in the book days of rage: america's radical underground, the fbi and the forgotten age of revolutionary violence. if anyone predicted that the us dollar would lose two-thirds of its purchasing power from 1966 to december 1981, their prediction isn't well known. what $1 bought at the market peak in 1966 cost $3 by december 1981, in the throes of the deepest recession since the great depression, a recession triggered by soaring interest rates and monetary tightening to crush the wage price spiral inflation that had become embedded in the economy by 1980. note that dow 1,000 in october 1982 was only dow 330 when adjusted for inflation since the peak in 1966 – $1 in february 1966 equaled $3.07 in october 1982. from the dow's top in january 1973 at 1,051.70 to the point when the dow reached 1,012 in october 1982, $1 in january 1973 was $2.31 in october 1982. so dow 1,000 in january 1973 meant dow 435 in october 1982.",1
2024-08-01,"these data points are from the cpi inflation calculator (bls.gov). few predicted the demise of the belief that ""stocks only go up"" and the market was a moneymaking machine available to all gamblers, oops, i mean ""investors"". if we propose that the 2020s will mirror the 1970s not in the precise dynamics but in the unpredictability of crises and reversals of all that is stable, known and reliable, then we cannot possibly predict what lies ahead. we can only anticipate twisters on the horizon that will be completely unexpected and potentially disruptive on a scale that stretches across culture, society, politics and the economy. if we're in a remake of that '70s show, the plot twists – and twisters heading our way – may be far wilder than we can currently imagine. and frankly, i fear for our nation. that's right – i fear for our nation, and i am not alone. the echoes of the past are becoming louder, and i recall the decades between 1961 and 1981 with trepidation, for that era was marked by crisis, tumult, discord, civil violence, war, a near miss of nuclear war, extreme polarization and assassinations. many americans sense the country never really recovered from the assassination of president john f. kennedy in 1963, or from the assassinations of presidential candidate bobby kennedy and civil rights leader martin luther king jr. five years later in 1968.",1
2024-08-01,"an attempt on the life of president gerald ford was narrowly thwarted in 1975, and an attempted assassination of president ronald reagan very nearly succeeded in 1981. a terrible madness swept the land, as dozens of bombings and the bizarre kidnapping of media heiress patty hearst by a domestic terror cell pockmarked the 1970s, a decade marked by a failed presidency, revelations of domestic spying by federal security agencies and runaway inflation. it was a very long night before morning dawned in america again. from the longer view, the 20 years of tumult can be understood as the political and social reaction to what changed in america in the previous 20 years of 1941-1960. america had been roused from isolationism to fight a world war, forced to protect allies in europe and asia from the threat posed by an expansionist totalitarian soviet union and deal with a century-old reckoning with the racial divide that made a mockery of our nation's principle that ""all men are created equal"" and should be treated equally before the law. the promises made by the founding documents of the nation had yet to be fulfilled. the very success of our protection of war-devastated allies created an economic crisis of our own, as the old, less-efficient industrial plant of america was outpaced by the new industries that arose in germany and japan with modern technologies, industries aided by america's open door to exports and the strong dollar.",1
2024-08-01,"the 1970s was a decade of economic adjustment with high costs to both capital and labor as the energy crisis and the need to tackle industrial pollution drove a multitrillion-dollar (in today's dollars) rebuilding of american industry, a process punctuated by recessions that caused great misery for those laid off and struggling with high inflation. these sacrifices and conflicts eventually paid dividends. inequality eased, high interest rates crushed the inflationary spiral and the investments in higher efficiencies and new technologies started paying off. my fear is that we've entered another 20 years of tumult, chaotic conflict, infectious madness and discord, but without the resilience we possessed in the 1960s and 1970s, the resilience generated by low debt, strong domestic industries and supply chains, low levels of regulation, low-cost health care and education and much higher levels of civic virtue, community, national purpose, moral legitimacy and self-reliance than are visible today. whether we admit it or not, we are riven by rising inequality in wealth and opportunity, high debt loads and little consensus on how to get through the night in one piece and emerge better from facing the challenges head on. i fear the siren-song appeal of denial and magical thinking, as if a rocket to mars or a new phone app or another ai chatbot will fix what's broken in america. i fear our buffers have been thinned, and our ability to make sacrifices for the future has been lost.",1

2024-07-30,"gold coins and bars: germany sells, china and india buy article:western gold investment sinks, asia jumps on new data... gold investment trends have diverged between asian and western households on 2024's fresh record prices, new data says today, with germany – the coin-and-small-bar industry's former darling – becoming a net seller overall in april to june while retail gold investing jumped in china and india. that's according to figures compiled by specialist analysts metals focus and released tuesday by the mining industry's world gold council. the no.1 gold consumer nation china saw net demand to buy bullion coins and retail investment bars jump by more than 3/5ths year-on-year in the second quarter, setting a series record for q2 demand outside of 2013's price crash surge. no.2 consumer india also saw a surge of gold coin and small bullion-bar buying, with its net total rising by almost one-half from spring 2023. on a rolling 4-quarter basis, that means indian households – now enjoying a marked drop in prices after the bjp-led government slashed gold import duty last week – haven't chosen to buy this much gold in the form of bullion coins and small bars since the 12 months ending september 2014. china's 4-quarter total meantime comes only 5 tonnes shy of its past decade's peak, with coin-and-bar demand reaching nearly 355 tonnes in the 12 months to june after q2 saw mainland chinese retail gold investing hit 80 tonnes.",0
2024-07-30,"that was barely 6 tonnes behind china's gross demand for gold jewellery between april and june, the tightest gap since at least 2010 on the world gold council's gold demand trends data. separate figures from the china gold association say coin-and-small-bar demand outstripped jewellery purchases this spring, reaching 107 tonnes versus 86 and marking a flip from adornment to investment not seen before on modern data as the world's 2nd largest economy and 2nd most populous nation faces a real estate slump, a bear-market in equities, and a sharp slowdown in gdp growth. in contrast to asia's 2 giant consumer markets, rich western economies all saw gold coin-and-small-bar demand drop in q2 from the same period last year on today's world gold council figures, with households in two european markets choosing to sell and take profit overall on the precious metal's fresh all-time price highs. australia fell 19% by weight, japan 26%, north america 48%, and western europe 65%, led by a 3rd consecutive calendar quarter of net selling in france and the first such liquidation by german households since at least 2010. between 2010 and 2022, germany was the 3rd largest national consumer of gold coins and retail-investment bullion bars in all but 2 years, when it came second only to world no.1 china in 2020 and 2022.",0

2024-07-30,"trump's bitcoin watershed article:remember when btc was only for crooks...? donald trump spoke at the bitcoin 2024 conference in nashville this weekend, making history as the first former us president to attend the conference and make a full-throated endorsement of bitcoin, writes frank holmes at us global investors. my team and i had the pleasure of joining some 8,000 other bitcoiners to listen to trump's speech, which i believe will be remembered as a watershed moment in the history of the digital asset. i'll share more details from trump's speech below, but for now, i want you to consider how far bitcoin has come in just the first 15 years of its existence. you may remember a time not so long ago when the prevailing perception of bitcoin was that only criminals and terrorists used it. it wasn't on any institutional investor's radar. warren buffett famously called it ""rat poison squared"". how things have changed! post-bitcoin etfs, the world is gradually moving toward mass adoption. major tech companies, from microstrategy to tesla, keep it on their balance sheet. in two countries so far, it's used as legal tender. and now a former us president is throwing his full weight behind it. bitcoin's price could be ""going to the moon,"" president trump said, and if that's the case, he ""want[s] america to be the nation that leads the way."" i don't think it's hyperbole to say that this year's presidential race is unlike any in modern us history – maybe ever.",2
2024-07-30,"president joe biden's withdrawal and endorsement of vice president kamala harris has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, and while former president donald trump remains the frontrunner, the wind has certainly shifted in harris's favor. she's managed to secure a majority of democratic delegates, and she now has the endorsement of all top party leaders, including barack obama. harris's campaign said it raised a jaw-dropping $200 million in the first week of her campaign, which, if true, has to be a record. users on the online betting platform polymarket now believe the vice president has a 38% probability of winning in november, up from just 1% just a month earlier. as a bit of trivia, biden isn't the first sitting president to choose not to seek reelection, but he's the first to make the announcement so close to election day. not including richard nixon, who quit the office outright in 1974, the last two presidents to forgo reelection were lyndon johnson, in 1968, and harry truman, in 1952. this political upheaval comes at a time when the us economy is sending mixed signals. on the one hand, gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the second quarter hit an impressive 2.8%, beating expectations and more than doubling the growth in the first quarter. the s&p 500 is up about 14% this year, despite recent pullbacks as investors rotate out of high-flying tech stocks into smaller, undervalued companies.",2
2024-07-30,"the shift appears to be partly driven by expectations of lower interest rates from the federal reserve. in any case, these positive indicators – a solid economy and stock market – typically bode well for the incumbent party, giving harris an edge. however, we can't ignore the economic anxiety that many americans are feeling right now. a recent survey by buy-now-pay-later company affirm found that three in five americans believe we're in a recession, even though we're not officially in one. credit card payment delinquencies are also rising at a concerning rate right now as americans' pandemic-era savings have run dry. the percentage of cardholders who are more than 30 days delinquent is at a 12-year high, while the percentage of those who are 60 days or more past due hit a new series high of around 2.6%. recently, i discussed j.d.vance, a former venture capitalist and trump's running mate. i indicated that vance is likely to serve as the trump campaign's bridge to silicon valley's deep pockets. but harris, 59, has similar connections as well. she served as california's attorney general from 2011 to 2017 and then as senator from 2017 to 2021. as a result, she reportedly has long-term connections to silicon valley. the new york times reports that, in past campaigns, the vice president has relied on silicon valley's tech elites for donations.",2

2024-07-29,"india gold demand 'up 15-40%' on shock cut to import duty article:surprise after gold-smuggling surge, record price discounts... the government of india has slashed import duty on gold and silver, more than halving the incentive offered to smugglers in the precious metals' no.2 consumer market and boosting industry forecasts for this autumn's festive and wedding demand as rupee prices drop from record highs. last week's surprise move – announced by finance minister nirmala sitharaman as part a new tax simplification drive – came after a decade of lobbying by india's bullion and jewelry industry was repeatedly spurned by the bjp government led by narendra modi and re-elected but without an outright majority in june. now slashed from a modern-era record of 15% to just 6% for gold and silver bullion, india's heavy rate of import duty has been blamed for a surge in smuggling as well as growing exploitation of loopholes, trade agreements and tax differentials for unrefined doré and gold-plated platinum. such 'unofficial' inflows meant that, compared to gold prices in london – heart of the precious metal's global trading and storage network – plus general sales tax rates of 3% and the 15% import duty, gold in india traded at a discount to the 'official' quote almost without pause since 2015 according to figures gathered and published by the mining industry's world gold council.",0

2024-07-26,"but instead, the chaumet designed 529-gram mix of silver (95.5%), wrought iron (3.4%) and a little gold (1.1%, some 6 grams) would set you back £1,183 ($1,528 or €1408) in the wholesale metal markets right now. indeed, when it comes to gold medals, only two of the 30 summer sporting events since the ancient greek games were revived have given each winner a prize of that most precious metal. the first modern games, held in athens in 1896, didn't give gold at all to first place, but awarded a silver medal instead (plus an olive wreath), with second-place runners up receiving a copper-based bronze medallion. the next games, paris 1900, set the trend for gilding silver with gold to award as first prize. only the next two games, st.louis 1904 and london 1908, awarded a true gold medal to olympic winners. since then, olympic gold medals have in fact been mostly silver – gilded with a layer of gold – while silver medals also typically contain a small quantity of copper to help harden them, too. and while the metallic composition has changed a little across the years, the size and shape of olympic medals has varied widely. typically round, medals at paris 1900 were instead rectangular, and stockholm 1912 prizes were oval. the thinnest medals were awarded in stockholm in 1956 (where just the equestrian events took place, while the other games were hosted on the other side of the world in melbourne), measuring only 2.5 millimetres in depth.",1

2024-07-24,"the china myth debunked article:middle-income trap springs for ageing giant... myths die hard, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. among these is the great myth that china is poised to take over the world. today i'll debunk that myth. no one seriously disputes the importance of china to the global economy. it's the world's second-largest economy after the us and accounts for 17% of global gdp (or an even larger per centage if one uses an alternative accounting method called purchasing power parity). it has the world's second-largest population at 1.41 billion people, just slightly behind india. it has the third-largest landmass in the world behind russia and canada. china also has the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal after russia and the us but size can be deceptive. most observers translate china's large economy into the status of global superpower soon to surpass the us in economic and military strength. that extrapolation has been a chimera for some time. in reality, china's economy is fragile and weakening by the day. china may soon find itself in economic turmoil including a credit crisis, currency crisis and economic recession all at the same time. following is a close look at china's inherent weakness. unfortunately for us investors, china's problems threaten to drag the global economy down with it. china's economic problems exist at two levels – the long-term macro level and the short-term technical level.",2
2024-07-24,"let's consider these in order: at the long-term level, china is confronting three material obstacles – the middle-income trap, declining demographics and wasted investment. the middle-income trap afflicts developing economies that have reached the middle-income level of about $10,000 per capita annually. moving from low-income (about $5,000 per capita annually) is straightforward. countries move populations from rural to urban environments, build suitable housing and infrastructure, attract direct foreign investment with cheap labor and low operating costs, engage in assembly-type manufacturing and run significant trade surpluses by exporting the manufactured goods. the difficulty is in moving from middle-income to high-income ($20,000 per capita annually or higher). for that, low value-added manufacturing isn't enough. it's necessary to move to high-tech, high value-added manufacturing, which requires original research and development and access to high-tech tools such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment. china has acquired some of these tools through theft of intellectual property, but not enough. china also faces fierce competition from those already engaged in high-tech manufacturing including taiwan, south korea, singapore and japan. only a handful of countries have ever made the move from middle-income to high-income, including those just mentioned.",2
2024-07-24,"many more including turkey, malaysia, indonesia, india and south africa are stuck in the same middle-income trap as china. the prospects of china breaking out of the middle-income bracket are slim, especially now that foreign direct investment is moving toward india and vietnam and away from china. this conundrum alone is enough to put the brakes on chinese growth. china is also confronted with what will become the greatest demographic disaster since the black death in the 14th century. this is the bitter fruit of china's one-child policy from 1980-2015 combined with mass infanticide of girls. the demographic challenge is increased by greater educational and career opportunities for women, which impacts family formation, and an historic shift in the role of the family. china's population may decline from 1.41 billion to 750 million over the next 50 years. that's a loss of over 650 million people. considering that one definition of gdp is working-age population x productivity, it follows that china's gdp will suffer a spectacular decline over the remainder of this century. (note: the total gdp will decline but per capita gdp may be maintained because the population itself is shrinking.) finally, china has wasted much of the wealth it did earn during the past 30 years with bad investments in unneeded infrastructure.",2
2024-07-24,"a mature economy devotes about 25% of gdp to new investment (plant, equipment, homes, transportation, etc.) and about 65% to consumption. (the remaining 10% is split between trade surpluses or deficits and government spending.) in china, that split is reversed. about 45% of gdp goes to investment and only about 25% goes to consumption. that amount of investment can lead to high productivity gains in the future if it is spent intelligently on essential infrastructure, transportation, high-tech plants and equipment as well as research and development. instead, china wasted the money on ""ghost cities"" (ample infrastructure with no residents or business tenants) and extravagant white elephants such as the nanjing south train station, which has marble walls and 128 escalators but very few train passengers. such show projects do produce short-term jobs and demand for copper, glass, steel and aluminum. but when the project is finished, the jobs disappear (unless diverted to another wasteful project) and the infrastructure is nonproductive with high maintenance costs. if chinese gdp were adjusted for losses due to wasted investment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the reported growth figures of the past 30 years would have been reduced 20% or more. those losses are real whether the figures are adjusted or not.",2
2024-07-24,"based on these three factors – the middle-income trap, declining demographics and wasted investment – the so-called chinese miracle has turned into a dead end. china's failing growth engine is not due solely to these long-term factors. among the short-term headwinds to growth are an excessive debt-to-gdp ratio, a drying up of direct foreign investment, a dollar shortage and a rapidly declining currency. harvard economists carmen reinhart and ken rogoff have demonstrated that debt-to-gdp ratios in excess of 90% will reduce the keynesian multiplier of additional debt-financed government spending below 1.0. this means that for economies in that condition, if they borrow a dollar and spend a dollar, they receive less than a dollar of added gdp. of course, this process drives the ratio even higher (since the gdp denominator grows more slowly than the debt numerator), which slows growth even further. in plain language, you can't borrow your way out of a debt crisis. china has one of the highest debt-to-gdp ratios in the world, well over 300%. (much of this debt is buried at the provincial level or in state-controlled banks rather than sovereign bonds, but the debt/growth dynamic is the same.) this debt overhang will retard chinese growth independent of the other factors mentioned in this article. because of trade wars, tariff wars and deteriorating chinese-us relations, direct foreign investment is being diverted from china to other high-growth centers, including india.",2
2024-07-24,"china's ample (but declining) labor force cannot be productive without foreign direct investment to fund state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and new technology. china is doomed to stagnate along the lines of the former soviet union without a continual supply of new capital and technology. china's dollar-denominated trade surpluses cannot fill the gap because those reserves are needed to service dollar-denominated debt of chinese state-owned enterprises and to prop up chinese bank balance sheets. that's the real reason why chinese holdings of us treasury securities are declining. it's not because china is ""dumping"" treasuries. it's because china must sell the treasuries to obtain dollars to prop up its debts and to deal with a global dollar shortage. all of these negative trends are expressed in the rapid decline of the usd/cny exchange rate. after hitting an interim peak of 7.10 to $1.00 on jan. 31, 2024, the chinese yuan broke through a central bank target of 7.25 in mid-june and is now trading at 7.27. cny will continue this decline, perhaps hitting 7.30 to $1.00 in the weeks ahead. a crashing currency is not as advantageous for exports as many imagine since china's value added on exports is only about 5%. it has to import most of the inputs it uses to manufacture exports from japan, south korea, germany and taiwan. a declining currency increases the cost of those imports and reduces china's competitiveness.",2
2024-07-24,"it also makes foreign direct investment less attractive and hurts china's efforts to move to a consumer economy by causing inflation on imported goods. it would be a serious matter if china were slowing rapidly and the problems were confined to china. they're not. slower growth in china hurts japanese banks, which are heavily invested there. it hurts south korean, taiwanese and australian exporters that rely on chinese markets. it also contributes to a global slowdown that's already affected germany, france, japan and the uk and it hurts us investors who are facing a wave of company failures and bond defaults. the us won't be insulated from this global slowdown that threatens to become a global recession and financial crisis. i believe us investors should dump chinese stocks and etfs and reduce equity holdings generally. we're entering another ""cash is king"" stage with china leading the way.",2
2024-07-23,"william blake's 'birmingham' article:mind-forged manacles in the midlands... if you're not familiar with the name anthony daniels, you might know him by his nom de plume theodore dalrymple, says tim price at price value partners. under that name he writes for, among other titles, the uk's daily telegraph and the spectator. daniels is a now a retired prison doctor and psychiatrist, but also a profoundly gifted writer and thinker. he recently asked whether our society is broken, and his argument would tend to conclude in the affirmative. one example he cites is of a single mother in birmingham, living on welfare in a house with her three small children. outside, is a garden littered with domestic rubbish. daniels asks the mother whether it might not be a good idea to clear the rubbish so that her children can play freely in the garden without risk of injury or disease. she replies that she's called the council but, as yet, nobody has bothered to come round. daniels goes on to cite a phrase from a poem by the great english writer william blake. the poem in question is 'london': ""in every cry of every man, in every infants cry of fear, in every voice: in every ban, the mind-forg'd manacles i hear..."" those ""mind-forg'd manacles"" are iron chains of our own casting.",0
2024-07-23,"john milton makes a similar point in 'paradise lost' when he has the devil, having been cast down to hell, suggesting (perhaps somewhat disingenuously, as his intent is to goad on the other fallen angels to resume battle with god): ""the mind is its own place, and in it self can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n."" in any event, as both these quotations strongly suggest, the overwhelming thing that can make the difference in our lives is not so much our circumstances but our attitude. to put it another way, mental toughness counts for a lot. it's not the dog in the fight, so much as the fight in the dog. this is the point made by morgan housel in his excellent presentation 'what other industries teach us about investing'. the story of grace grahner is instructive (emphasis ours): ""grace grahner was born in 1909, just right outside of chicago nearby. and she had kind of a hard life. she was orphaned as a child, she began her career in the bottom of the great depression. finally found a career as a secretary, where she worked her entire life. never married, never had kids, never learned how to drive a car. lived almost her entire life in a one room house, not far from here. ""by all accounts, she was a lovely lady, but lived kind of a sad life. and grace grahner died in 2010, she was 100 years old.",0
2024-07-23,"and everyone who knew her was completely shocked to learn, when she died, that she had seven million dollars to her name, that she left all of it to charity, and that began kind of a search among the people who knew her, that said, 'how does this humble secretary accumulate seven million dollars?' and her secret was, she really had no secret at all. she saved what little she could, she put it in the stock market, she let it compound for 80 years and that was it, end of story. ""the second investor i want to talk about today is a guy named richard. save his last name, because you're not supposed to criticize people in public. although i do a lot. richard had almost the exact opposite background of grace grahner. born into a wealthy family, went to the university of chicago, got his mba at harvard business school, went to work on wall street, worked his way up at some of the biggest investment firms, became the vice chairman of one of the largest investment banks and without exaggerating was one of the most powerful people in global finance. ""the day after grace grahner died, richard filed for personal bankruptcy. he told the bankruptcy judge that the financial crisis completely wiped him out, he had no more assets, no more income and he was fighting to save foreclosure on his house. and what's interesting about these stories, i think, is that in no other industry except finance are those stories possible.",0
2024-07-23,"there's no other industry in which someone with no education, no background and no experience can vastly outperform someone with the best background, the best education, the best experience. ""it's unthinkable that grace grahner could have performed heart surgery better than a harvard-educated cardiologist, or built a skyscraper better than the best construction company. it's completely unthinkable that that could ever happen, but it happens in investing. and what i think it shows is that investing is not necessarily about what you know, it's about how you behave."" for avid consumers of news, it's difficult not to get wholly disillusioned by the headlines at present. conflict in ukraine and gaza rumbles on; politics globally is a chaotic hot mess; many financial markets remain horribly expensive, and the us debt dynamic looks downright dreadful. the ability to remain calm, patient and, we might say, somewhat ""stoical"" is not evenly distributed among investors. what morgan housel might well have said is that successful long-term investing is really about a straightforward binary decision between maths and magic. you can believe in maths (ie, that the underlying profits of a successful business, over time, will broadly be matched by subsequent shareholder returns), or you can believe in the magic that goes with any number of plausible-sounding narratives involving growth stocks which absolves them of having to justify any remotely sensible investing metric whatsoever.",0

2024-07-23,"even though we know from the vantage point of the 21st century how the history of the second world war plays out, 'the last lion' is so well-written, so grippingly ""in the moment"" with a wealth of sourced material, that it almost manages to persuade you, as you read it, that our country's fate could yet be in the balance. the best history is always fascinating. 'the last lion' provokes some intriguing counterfactuals. if britain had had a more informed and aggressive government during the 1930s appeasement crisis, could war have been averted? if churchill had not been installed in 1939, could we have won the war without him? (we happen to think not, but the question bears asking.) bear in mind that britain fought essentially alone for two years, haemorrhaging blood and treasure, while we waited desperately for the us to come in on our side. if the japanese had not invaded pearl harbour, franklin d. roosevelt, fighting his own domestic pacifists and isolationists, might not have joined the fight when he did, and the course of the war might have been very different. or if hitler had not pursued the grotesque folly of invading russia. as an alumnus, churchill gave a speech at harrow school in october 1941. within it, this extract is particularly important (emphasis added): ""you cannot tell from appearances how things will go. sometimes imagination makes things out far worse than they are; yet without imagination not much can be done.",0

2024-07-23,"here, for example, is manchester and reid's account of those german raids on our air fields: ""churchill followed the day's fighting from no.11 group headquarters at uxbridge, and he left clearly affected. climbing into his limousine with ismay, he said, 'don't speak to me. i'm too moved.' his lips were trembling. they rode in silence for a few minutes. then churchill turned to ismay and said something that 'burned into' ismay's mind, so much so that he went home that night and repeated the words to his wife. ""five days later, when the most difficult and dangerous period in the battle was about to begin, churchill paused during a long address to the house of commons on the overall war situation, and delivered his tribute to the raf: ""the gratitude of every home in our island, in our empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the british airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge of mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and their devotion."" ""then, he spoke the words that had so moved ismay: ""never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."" two final suggestions. per dalrymple, blake and milton, the biggest threat facing us – in the worlds of the real as well as the narrowly financial – is the threat we create within our own minds.",0

""growth, growth, growth!"" is their eternal mandate. thus the economic apparatus must hum perpetually at a very high pitch. if it slackens, if it sheds steam, if it wobbles, the economic engineers leap immediately to action. they will not permit the thing to go along on its own. thus their skulls are scenes of dizzying and delirious neurological activity. they whir with prescriptions to elevate the economic level, to elevate consumption, to elevate investment. to this end they suppress interest rates. they fabricate oceans of credit – that is, debt – from the great abysm of nothingness.",1
2024-07-22,"they seek to bend economic law to their defiant and hubristic will. that is, they do not simply observe the economic laws at work upon the human subject. thus they are not scientists. they are engineers. and their engineering is nearly always botchwork. imagine converting a heavenly observer – an astronomer – to a heavenly engineer. that is, stuff his head with the economist's aspirations. here is what he will tell you: ""we have established that the gravitational constant is inadequate to our economic needs. if we can simply alter this so-called constant through wise, applied intervention, we could expect a 10% annual increase to gdp. we must therefore rearrange the gravitational constant to produce the desired economic result."" here you have the psychology of an economist. it is not the psychology of a scientist. now imagine that the astronomer acquires the tools of manipulation in his sphere...that the economist has acquired in his. he can distort gravity, he can alter the planetary orbits and the like. within no time the planets would be veering from their courses, the stars would go plummeting, entire galaxies would be set upon collision courses. after all: look what his economist counterpart has inflicted upon this world. because of his counsel it is a world deluged by debt, financial fragility and related evils. we are infinitely fortunate that the means of astronomical manipulation remain beyond human reach. here is a point the economist must consider...",1

2024-07-17,"back in january, the silver institute forecasted that global silver demand will reach a near-record 1.2 billion ounces in 2024, up 1% from last year. this growth is primarily fueled by industrial applications, particularly in the booming solar energy sector. we're looking at the fourth consecutive year of a structural market deficit in silver. the deficit is expected to widen by 17%, reaching 215.3 million ounces. loyal readers should be aware of what happens when demand outstrips supply – prices tend to rise. oil, our second top performer with a gain of 13.8%, continues to demonstrate its staying power in the global economy. despite the push for electrification, oil demand remains robust. according to a new report by the international energy agency (iea), we're approaching a significant turning point. global oil demand, which averaged just over 102 million barrels per day in 2023, is expected to level off near 106 million barrels per day toward the end of this decade. this plateau in demand coincides with a projected surge in global oil production, particularly from non-opec+ producers. the implications of this forecast are profound. we're looking at a future where oil supplies could reach levels of abundance unseen outside of the pandemic. this potential oversupply situation could exert downward pressure on oil prices. it's worth noting that the iea's outlook contrasts with some other forecasts.",0
2024-07-17,"goldman sachs research, for instance, expects oil demand to continue growing until 2034, potentially reaching 110 million barrels a day. they cite increasing demand from emerging asian markets and the petrochemical industry as key drivers. last but certainly not least is gold. the yellow metal has shone brightly in 2024, rising 12.8% year-to-date and outperforming many major asset classes. this performance is particularly impressive given the high interest rates and strong us dollar – conditions that ordinarily create a challenging environment for gold. what's behind the metal's resilience? it's a perfect storm of factors: continued central bank buying, strong asian investment flows, steady consumer demand and persistent geopolitical uncertainties. in its midyear outlook, the world gold council (wgc) estimates that central bank demand alone contributed at least 10% to gold's performance in 2023 and potentially around 5% so far this year. looking ahead, goldman has set a bullish target of $2700 per troy ounce for gold by year-end. that's an increase of about 16% from current levels. they cite solid demand from emerging market central banks and asian households as key drivers. many investors, myself included, appreciate gold's potential as a hedge against both inflation and geopolitical risks. it could provide a buffer against potential stock market volatility, especially if trade tensions escalate.",0
2024-07-17,"additionally, gold might see further upside if concerns about the us debt load increase or if there's a shift in federal reserve policy under a new administration. as we move into the second half of 2024, the commodities market continues to offer intriguing opportunities. silver's industrial demand, particularly in the green energy sector, presents a compelling growth story. oil remains a critical resource, especially for emerging economies, despite the global push towards renewables. and gold, the eternal safe haven, continues to prove its worth in uncertain times.",0
2024-07-16,"a whisker away from civil war article:what trump's assassination attempt means next... all americans should be relieved and grateful that donald trump survived an attempted assassination at a political rally in butler, pennsylvania, on saturday, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. elections should be decided at the ballot box, not through violence. of course, there are many on the political left who celebrated the assassination attempt. their only regret is that it failed. but most americans are happy that the attempt failed. we can only speculate about what might have happened if trump were killed. it would be a very different america today. we could have seen outrage, riots and threats of reprisal. it's frightening to contemplate. let's break it all down... trump was grazed by a bullet fired by the shooter thomas crooks. the shooter was killed seconds after shooting trump, but not before firing multiple rounds at trump and the crowd. our prayers go out to corey comperatore, a rally participant who was shot and killed by crooks while trying to shield his family from the killer's bullets. we also pray for comperatore's family and others critically wounded by the shooting. we know some of the pertinent facts, but there's far more we don't know. the shooter used an ar-15-style rifle with 5.56 mm rounds and fired from an adjacent rooftop at a distance of about 150 yards.",2
2024-07-16,"the ar-15 is a highly accurate rifle, the 5.56 mm is a high-pressure bullet, and 150 yards is a relatively short distance for any experienced shooter. i've fired the same weapon with the same ammo at that distance. the rifle is accurate with low recoil. a longer-barrel sniper-type weapon is not needed to hit a target at that relatively short distance. trump was grazed in the ear by one bullet, which led to bleeding but miraculously was not worse. still, the bullet came within a few millimeters of being a fatal headshot. trump turned his head away from the shooter's aim a split second before the bullet hit. if trump turned his head a split second earlier, the shooter could have adjusted his aim. if he turned his head a split second later, it would have been too late and the bullet would have penetrated his skull. the resulting overpressure inside his skull would have likely resulted in a mortal wound, similar to the wound that killed jfk, which was put on graphic display in the famous zapruder film. sadly, others were killed and critically wounded as crooks continued to fire. finally, a police sniper on a rooftop close to trump shot crooks in the head and he died on the scene with his murder weapon at hand. trump's reflexes after being shot were remarkable. he ducked beneath the bulletproof podium for cover as secret service officers piled on top of him as human shields.",2
2024-07-16,"once the shooting stopped and the area was deemed clear, trump got back on his feet looking disheveled and slightly dazed but still focused. as he was being escorted off the stage by the secret service, trump pumped his fist in the air and shouted, ""fight,"" to the crowd. this was an amazing display of strength, courage and presence of mind and gave encouragement both to the rally attendees and a global tv audience. the image of trump raising his fist and addressing the crowd, with blood splashed across his face, will go down as one of the most iconic images in american political history. trump was rushed to a hospital, treated and then released. he was back at his bedminster, new jersey, estate saturday evening and was actually on the golf course by sunday morning. he's now on his way to milwaukee, wisconsin, to attend the republican national convention. the convention itself is proceeding as planned, including the announcement of trump's choice for vice president, j.d.vance. that's what we know. the list of things we don't know is much longer. it's critical not to jump to conclusions, but it's not too soon to ask some hard questions. here's the list: why on earth was the shooter's position not occupied by the secret service? it's an obvious vantage point and potential sniper nest. even an amateur knows that, let alone the secret service. this was a security failure of the utmost magnitude that can't be overstated. it was that bad.",2
2024-07-16,"a number of witnesses have said they saw the shooter climbing up the roof with his rifle. they warned the local police and secret service with minutes to spare. nothing was done. why not? the police snipers on the roof closest to trump spotted the shooter in their scopes. they kept him in sight but did not kill him as should have been required under the circumstances. once the shooter opened fire, the police snipers killed him but not before five or six shots were fired including the one that hit trump. why the delay? some unverified reports say that the secret service refused to permit the police snipers to kill the assassin before the shooting began. that's possible, but we don't know at this point. it's also possible that the snipers were awaiting word on the shooter's identity before firing. there were several agencies with law enforcement personnel on site that day, and they may have been trying to contact the different agencies to determine if they had someone manning that position. the snipers didn't want to kill a police officer. meanwhile, some of the secret service detail closest to trump acted heroically and shielded his body with their own while the area was being secured. but not all. in particular, three female secret service officers with trump looked like the keystone cops. one cowered behind the podium for cover instead of putting her body in harm's way as required.",2
2024-07-16,"one officer was so short that trump towered over her, which means she offered no body protection at all. donald trump is 6'3"". officers protecting him should be 6'4"" or taller. it's not rocket science. the woman protecting him appeared about 5'7"", was chubby and seemed out of shape. she could not holster her pistol and instead waved it around as trump was being pushed into his car. the three female secret service officers ran in circles near trump's car instead of forming a solid security perimeter. one appeared more concerned with getting her sunglasses on than protecting the former president. it was a clownish performance. was this the result of dei policies at the secret service implemented by kimberly cheatle, the new secret service head who publicly stated that dei was one of her priorities? there will be congressional hearings on this topic beginning monday. hopefully, there will be some accountability before copycat assassination attempts begin. but people are rarely held accountable in washington these days. just look at the afghanistan debacle. the impact of the attempted assassination on trump will be straightforward. not previously considered battlegrounds such as new hampshire, minnesota, virginia and new mexico are suddenly in play. biden's leads in reliably democrat states such as new york and new jersey are now down to single digits and could fall lower.",2
2024-07-16,"another political plus for trump is that the democrats have had to cancel a despicable advertising campaign they had planned referring to trump as a ""rapist,"" ""convicted felon"" and more. the budget for this ad campaign was $50 million and it was timed to run during the republican convention this week. those plans are on hold and may have to be scrapped completely as sympathy for trump grows. democrat politicians in down-ballot races for governor, senator and house member are in full panic mode. we could be looking at an electoral college landslide for trump of perhaps 340-195, which would be one of the largest electoral college wins in us history. the republicans could top that off by winning the senate 55-45 or better and expanding their majority in the house to 230 republicans-205 democrats. numerous governorships and state legislatures could fall the republicans' way as well. this brings us to the most widely discussed political topic prior to the assassination attempt – biden's collapse into senility, his physical infirmity, and the conflicting democrat attempts to cover up the reality of biden's health and to push him aside in favor of kamala harris. let's be blunt about biden's mental and physical health. biden is in the late stages of cognitive decline. he refuses to take any cognitive tests (or, if he has, to release the results) and to receive a proper diagnosis.",2
2024-07-16,"biden's personal physician is an old crony who has been in on biden family rackets, so he's hardly an objective source. jill biden is more of an acting president than a caring spouse and she's lousy at both jobs. a number of competent physicians have said that, in their view, biden has advanced parkinson's disease as evidenced by immobility in his right arm and shaking in his left hand in addition to the mental lapses. biden's recent public appearances are either totally scripted right down to flash cards with reporters' names and prearranged questions and answers, read from a teleprompter, or prerecorded (and who knows how many flubs were left on the cutting-room floor?). it's all a facade. historian victor davis hanson has compared biden's condition to the last days of leonid brezhnev, the soviet communist leader who died in 1982. long before brezhnev died, he was physically and mentally disabled and propped up by continual lies and propaganda about how he was in good health and in command. that artifice and wall of lies are exactly what we are encountering in the case of biden today. late sunday night, biden gave an oval office speech in reaction to the trump shooting and referred to the last president as ""former trump"" and made repeated references to the ""battle box"" instead of the ballot box. biden topped this off by almost saying, ""make america great again,"" before catching himself in mid-sentence and pivoting away from the maga republican mantra.",2
2024-07-16,"it was a pathetic performance in tightly controlled circumstances. biden is beyond functioning capably in the real world of politics, foreign crises and ongoing wars, let alone a political campaign. who's really in charge at the white house? it depends on the issue. when it comes to high-level policy, it's the obama team including holdovers like antony blinken and jake sullivan and obama flunkies on the sidelines like susan rice and victoria nuland. when it comes to technical matters that are part of the progressive agenda, the deep-state swamp creatures in the bureaucracy are in charge. but where the presidential campaign and biden's determination to remain a candidate are concerned, power rests with a small cabal. the members of this inner circle are ""taco"" jill biden, the convicted felon hunter biden, joe's sister valerie biden owens, and a few close aides including mike donilon, steve ricchetti, bruce reed, anthony bernal and annie tomasini. donilon is the brother of obama's national security adviser tom donilon. bruce reed is an old hand from the clinton administration. bernal and tomasini are close aides to jill biden and are practically an extension of the biden crime family. ricchetti is a lawyer and one of joe biden's longest-serving aides. that gang of eight are the only people with regular access to joe biden. they are the ones insisting that he's staying in the race and issuing the propaganda that says everything is fine with biden.",2
2024-07-16,"even regular white house staff such as chief of staff jeff zients, former chief of staff ron klain, adviser anita dunn, and biden's lawyer bob bauer cannot get close to biden anymore given the encasement established by the gang of eight. their posture can well be likened to a coup d'etat in america. it's not violent, but it is real. the gang of eight are running the country. biden is a zombie. at the same time, another gang of so-called super friends of biden including house minority leader hakeem jeffries, senate majority leader chuck schumer and former speaker nancy pelosi are preparing to tell biden he must withdraw from the presidential race for the good of the party and endorse kamala harris for the democratic presidential nomination. the shoot-out between the gang of eight and the super friends will happen by next weekend. you can think of it as the 1881 gunfight at the o.k. corral between the outlaw clanton and mclaury brothers on one side and wyatt, virgil and morgan earp and doc holliday on the other. the difference is that the o.k. corral featured bad guys versus good guys whereas the battle between the gang and the super friends has bad guys on both sides. they're all looking out for themselves. nothing public on the democratic side will happen this week because the news will be dominated by the trump shooting and the republican convention. by friday, the knives will be out for biden.",2
2024-07-16,"the democrats' plan is to nominate biden and harris in an all-virtual digital roll call vote in late july ahead of their scheduled aug. 19 convention in chicago. this means there will only be 10 days at most between the end of the republican convention and the democrats' virtual roll call. that's a short window for the super friends. biden's gang of eight may have successfully run out the clock. we'll know more next week, but for now it appears the dems may be going with the zombie candidate for better or worse. the biden family may emerge the winner. the american people are most certainly the losers.",2
2024-07-13,"things fall apart. big things article:geopolitical and financial risks are proliferating... the era of global integration and accord has ended and the era of global disintegration and discord is heating up, writes oftwomind's charles hugh smith in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. in historian peter turchin's terminology, when everyone finds reasons to cooperate, the result is an era of accord; when everyone finds reasons not to cooperate, the result is an era of discord. beneath the chaotic swirl of complex dynamics and risk, two core drivers emerge: de-globalization and de-financialization. the 30-year era of increasing globalization has reversed, reducing the influence of markets and increasing the influence of national security. where the globalization era led to global trade agreements which served at least a few of every participants' core interests, the de-globalization era will be characterized by fragmentation and deals being cut between nations outside of traditional alliances and ideological camps. in the neoliberal worldview, markets are solutions to virtually every problem: open up markets and let price discovery and innovations solve all problems. this construct is ideologically appealing, but in the real world, markets generated extremely risky supply-chain dependencies on unreliable offshore sources.",2
2024-07-13,"yes, these dependencies were efficient and profitable, but when things fall apart, they cause dominoes to fall far beyond what ""markets"" anticipated or could hedge. the 50-year era of increasing financialization has also reversed. in a nutshell, financialization optimized capital at the expense of labor/wage earners, and optimized speculation via the vast expansion of credit and leverage, enabling finance to commoditize virtually everything in the global economy – labor, capital, goods, services and yes, even risk. but commoditized risk that can be hedged only includes the risks that are visible and known. when extremes become more extreme, the potential for risk to escape the neatly fenced corral of hedged risk increases in ways that cannot be quantified and hedged. i tend to think many observers focus too narrowly on risks arising from financial crises, for example, a crisis in the multitrillion-dollar shadowy derivatives market that could cascade as holders of derivative contracts with claims on underlying collateral (for example, the homes underlying mortgages in a mortgage-backed security) start seizing the collateralized assets embedded in the derivatives chain. the basic idea is well-established: derivatives (such as clos and cdos as well as many even more exotic concoctions) can include claims on the underlying collateral of debt-based assets such as homes or vehicles.",2
2024-07-13,"the public has tolerated a stinking mass of self-serving bailouts and insider dealings under the threat of ""if we don't do this, the entire system collapses in a heap"" for the past 15 years, but their patience with financier strip-mining may run out more quickly than the political elites imagine. history suggests that social revolutions often start spontaneously from an apparently trivial event: the deadwood of a corrupt system rigged to funnel asymmetric rewards to the few at the expense of the many finally catches fire, and quickly becomes a conflagration. us elites seem to have no recognition of that dynamic. and they wonder why donald trump is so popular with working-class americans. elites want to decry trump's appeal to these ""deplorables"" without looking themselves in the mirror as to why trump appeals to them. if the traditional party system worked so well for this large swath of americans, trump never would have gotten so far. he would have been laughed off the stage in the 2016 primaries, and never would have won the republican nomination, let alone the general election. but trump won the election. and elites have refused to recognize their failure that resulted in his election. but the story is bigger. now let's consider the world – and the dollar. significant portions of the world are looking to ""de-dollarize."" this trend has greatly increased since the us has sought to ""weaponize"" the dollar to punish its geopolitical opponents.",2
2024-07-13,"more specifically, i'd characterize this vast reshuffling of global capital flows as a direct consequence of two factors: the ascendance of national security over market incentives (i.e. profits, mercantilist exports, etc.) the fragmentation of broad trade agreements in favor of special deals with trading partners that include not just tariffs but access to strategically significant commodities and investment capital flows. in other words, trade is no longer about opening new markets for mercantilist exports and parking surplus dollars in treasuries. it's about securing essential commodities and capital flows in exchange for access to supply chains and financial markets. the mercantilist era has ended. so-called free trade (there is no such thing) that created critical national security-related dependencies on frenemies is now something to avoid and reverse at all costs. mercantilist nations that have depended on increasing exports as the source of their economic growth will find markets restricted as relocalization and glocalization become priorities. (this includes china, germany, japan and other export-dependent economies). we can foresee deals that include access to commodities, guarantees to buy sovereign bonds, opening previously closed sectors of mercantilist economies and access to direct investment, not just trade and tariffs.",2
2024-07-13,"in other words, the fragmentation of global trade opens the door to deals brokered between individual nations, tailored to their own interests, that cover not just interests in trade per se but in securing commodities, essentials and capital flows. globalization is not dead, but it is fading. ""glocalization"" is becoming the new mantra. risk also rises when established processes break down as multiple crises emerge and reinforce each other – what's known as polycrisis. when established mechanisms no longer resolve crises or conflicts, then leaders will naturally be tempted to try ever more extreme measures to regain control (or the illusion of control). every leader is prone to miscalculation, but authoritarian regimes with highly concentrated nodes of decision-making are more prone to making catastrophically bad decisions because they've suppressed dissent and open debate as threats to the regime's political and narrative control. the global trend toward authoritarianism concentrates decision-making in the hands of the few, increasing the risks of fatal misjudgments or miscalculations. amidst a disconcertingly expanding universe of risks, here are 10 of note (hat tip to richard bonugli for assistance). it can be understood as a risk matrix.

2024-07-03,"so while much of the media appears surprised by the direction of democratic politics, the fact is that financial markets – and most notably safe-haven gold – have been little moved by the 'shock' events above... ...just like bullion prices didn't move on donald trump's clear win over joe biden in last week's us presidential debate. all this contrasts with the uk's 2016 brexit referendum result, when gold leapt 22% in british pound terms inside 6 hours and the msci world index of major-economy stock markets sank 4.9% against the dollar. it also marks a clear break from the news of trump's first white house victory that november, when gold spiked by 6% against the dollar only to fall hard by the time he took office the following january as the s&p500 rose by more than 6%, on its way to rising in all but one of the 12 months in 2017, something never achieved before or since (so far). the difference? shock, in a word. brexit and trump 1 weren't the consensus forecasts in 2016. (hell, they weren't even consensus among the uk or us electorates either.) whereas in 2024, national rally has been growing its share of french votes for well over a decade, and melania trump has no doubt kept the measurements for new carpets and drapes from her first stint as first lady. what's more, the odds of a political 'shock' today are vanishingly small, thanks to the genuine and relentless geopolitical shocks which the 2020s keep delivering.",0

2024-07-03,"monster bad breadth hits stocks article:but so what...? a subscriber sent me analysis calling for a 'monster [bullish] reversion trade for the ages' writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. it's based on the extreme under-performance of the equal weight spx (rsp) to the headline spx. the writer's conclusion is that after such an extreme divergence the spring back in rsp vs. spy/spx is strong and the broader market is the place to be for out-performance. can't argue with that. here is the daily chart of equal weight/headline comparison we often review along with its bearish implications (divergence) prior to the last two bear cycles. i have added the nominal view of rsp for context. true enough, after the market corrections equal weight sprang back to out-performance mode. the lesson is, you want to buy the broader market after a previous cycle has thinned out to the headliners and then finally the whole mess tanked. but the key here is 'after' market corrections. the analyst projects 'monster' gains for the broader market because the ratio at top has tanked to the degree of previous extremes that preceded 'monster reversion trades'.",0
2024-07-03,"i have a distaste for terms like 'monster', 'rocket', 'a train leaving the station', or the media's 'investors cheered' [insert here whatever eyeball harvesting news of the day triggers the cheer]; not to mention others like the 'got gold?' jingle and the commodity 'super cycle' that has been coming any day now for the last 16 years, the 'great rotation', the brics ""de-dollarization' pitch... ...and a whole host of other nicknames, jingles and promos that instigate greed and emotion in investors. so let's throw away the word 'monster' and simply review the situation. the analyst is correct, bottoms in the ratio have indeed preceded periods of broader market out-performance as the market seeks equilibrium after a negative divergence like today's has already tanked the markets, broad and equal weight alike. so it would appear that an important qualifier was omitted. indeed, the article's view is that it can keep going. here's the bottom line: the stock market rally can keep going. better yet, all stocks should begin to participate in the coming months...and years. market breadth readings indicate an undeniable truth: most stocks in the s&p 500 are vastly underperforming a handful of mega-cap behemoths. since 2007, this trend has rarely lasted long. more importantly, the setup is incredibly bullish for the under-loved stocks in the market.",0
2024-07-03,"if history is a guide, we will be looking at a monster reversion trade where the equal weighted s&p will play catch up to the market bellwethers. well of course, it ""can"" keep going. this market with its crossed signals and failed (or at least delayed historical quants) has been a challenge. like riding a bucking bronco or worse, a nasty and pissed off bull. but the fact is that when coloring the above analysis with actual historical facts, the rsp/spy ratio negatively diverged during phases where the nominal spy, and rsp for that matter, were rising. just like today. the big bullish ""monster"" trade [even there, i see no monster, just healthy broad breadth leadership] did not materialize until after widespread price damage was done to most markets. the writer uses 2007 as the historical 'look back' period, so lets widen our view. never in the history of this view has the ""monster"" bullish signal come about while the nominal stock market was still rising, let alone making new highs. that seems to me to be an important qualifier. the big reversion trade in 2009 came after a pervasive market crash. the big reversion trade in 2020 also came after a market crash, of sorts. now, let's take it a step further. you may recall that the fact that rsp/spy was rising during the supposed bear market of 2022 aided our view that it was not a real bear market but rather, an extended correction. rsp/spy was a positive breadth underpinning.",0

2024-07-01,"sterling's post-imperial warning for the dollar article:brics currency forecast redux... you've probably heard that the us economy is heavily 'financialized' writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. what does that really mean? what is financialization? it's a big topic and not very well defined. it can refer to the dominance of financial activity over traditional business activity in goods and services. it can refer to market bubbles. it can refer to the use of financial instruments in non-traditional arenas such as warfare or political witch hunts. in fact, it refers to all the above and more. investors need to understand financialization in order not to be blindsided by market activity that defies fundamental analysis. we can begin our review of financialization with a look at the role of the us dollar in global transactions. this is not a technical article detailing the plumbing of the financial system. but in considering the role of currencies in global finance, it's important to distinguish between reserves (basically a nation's savings account) and payments (transactions, trade, etc.). the denomination of global reserves today is approximately 58% us dollars and 20% euros. the remaining 22% is divided among yen (6%), sterling (5%), canadian dollars (2.5%) and other currencies are each less than 2% (aud, cny, chf).",2
2024-07-01,"in payments (measured in swift message traffic), the us dollar is about 59% of payments, with the euro at 13%, yen at 6%, sterling at 5% and yuan and cad at about 3% each. all other currencies are less than 3% each. the relatively larger role of the dollar in payments is due to higher oil prices and oil being denominated in dollars. swift message traffic is almost exclusively interbank payments among large banks. there are many bilateral payments (for example, russian payments to india in local currencies) that do not go via swift. there is no immediate threat to the role of the us dollar in either reserves or payments. i recently debunked the fake news that saudi arabia has just ended the petro-dollar deal that's been in place since 1974. instead there's a slow, steady erosion in the role of the dollar that could accelerate in the future. a good case study is the decline of sterling. in 1914, it was the dominant reserve and trade currency. by 1944, it had largely been displaced by the us dollar as a result of bretton woods. today, sterling is barely a footnote in global reserves and payments. still, that decline took 30 years (1914-1944) and continued for another 80 years (1944-2024). major currencies don't simply disappear overnight, but they are subject to these types of declines and gradual displacement by alternatives. contrary to what you hear from a lot of fringe analysts, the russian ruble and chinese yuan will not displace the us dollar.",2
2024-07-01,"neither currency is widely accepted outside its home country. those currencies have limited uses and lack large liquid bond markets, and their source countries lack a rule of law. notions of a 'gold-backed yuan' are nonsense. china simply doesn't have enough gold. a brics currency is a more likely alternative to the dollar for global payments. it won't be issued for several more years. the brics are currently expanding their membership and will expand it further at their summit in kazan, russia in october. that's critical because a larger membership increases the trading zone where the currency can be used. non-brics members can also agree to accept the new brics currency if they wish. if you receive the brics currency in trade, it's more useful if you can spend it or invest it in 20 or 30 other countries rather than just one trading partner as is the case with rubles, yuan and rupees. this process of expanding the currency zone with new members will take a few more years, but the infrastructure is being put in place now. the development of the euro (which took eight years from the 1992 maastricht treaty to launch in 2000) is a good model for this. while a brics currency will be used in trade in a few years, it will take longer to develop as a reserve currency. that requires the creation of a large, liquid bond market, which takes a legal code, issuers, dealers, settlement channels, hedging tools and much more. that process can take 10 years or longer.",2
2024-07-01,"what we should expect is not a sudden collapse of the us dollar and the us treasury market in payments and reserves, but rather a slow, steady diminution in the role of the dollar similar to what happened with sterling after world war i. in the short run, the main alternative to the us dollar in reserve positions is not another currency, but gold. central banks have been net purchasers of gold since 2010, reversing their status as net sellers that had prevailed since 1970. these net purchases of gold are reflected in increases in gold as a percentage of total reserves. gold now represents over 70% of us reserves, 25% of russian reserves and 8% of chinese reserves. curiously, gold isn't even reported in the imf's official reserve asset reports, despite the fact that the imf itself owns over 1,000 metric tonnes of gold. gold has the added attraction of being a physical, non-digital asset that cannot be frozen or seized by the united states. the most conspicuous example of financialization is the use of financial sanctions in warfare. this might better be called the weaponization of the dollar. us sanctions against russia have failed badly (as i predicted in 2022) to the point that the russian economy is now outperforming the us economy by every important metric. the us hasn't learned its lesson and is moving to more dangerous methods. the us froze russian assets (about $300 billion in us treasury securities) at the start of the war in ukraine.",2

2024-06-28,"golden nugget article:so much smarter than the other gold bugs... gold is misunderstood, but the misunderstanding extends to those critical of others for misunderstanding it, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. because in wonderland what is, it wouldn't be. the subject of this post has been made anonymous, as i've decided to release it to a wider audience. said subject anonymized those he was critical of and so, turnabout is fair play. elliott wave technical analyst mr.anonymous (mr.a) has an article explaining his view of why gold is misunderstood by analysts that claim it is a hedge against inflation and a hedge against stock market weakness. on the surface, he is correct. you cannot argue with facts and the facts are that gold has been a less than stellar inflation hedge (under certain inflationary circumstances) and it did go down significantly during armageddon '08 and the 2020 pandemic crash. as noted more times than i care to remember, there are far better hedges against inflation than gold when the inflation manufactured by policymakers is working, albeit temporarily, in support of the economy. mr.a is also correct in noting that gold went down in the market crash of 2008 and the lesser crash in 2020. so what is my beef here?",2
2024-06-28,"well, we have yet another analyst discussing gold as if it were simply an asset among other assets, focusing on its nominal performance rather than its long-term value and importantly, its relative value when marked up or marked down, as the anti-bubble to most other asset markets, which have been sustained for decades now by a bubble in aggressive and inflationary policy-making. it is a bubble that i believe has ended, although it doesn't consciously know it yet, with policy-propped asset markets now little more dead men walking. that assertion is based on several macro indicators i use, but none are more visually striking than the decades long trend break in the 30-year treasury yield continuum. among other things, that trend break implies that the ease with which policymakers were able to inflate the system at every crisis or even hint of crisis is a thing of the past. the sedate bond market signaling gentle disinflation gave license to inflationary policy at every sharp downward turn of the continuum. that ease and simplicity is history now, and hence the odds have increased that the bubble is done (although still stumbling forward trying to make its way to or through the us presidential election with several fiscal initiatives beyond the scope of this article in play). but here is the key point: gold is the anti-bubble.",2
2024-06-28,"its positive correlation with bubble beneficiary markets since it ended its post-2020 corrective phase in q4 2022 is one of two things: cause for concern about the nominal gold price when stock markets take the next bear, or the beginning of the new macro as gold looks ahead to the obvious end of the policy-induced bubble. when stock markets take the bear, i would not bet on gold merrily going up. so there again, on the surface mr.a is correct. however, it sure as shootin' will outperform. let's take a few quotes and rebut, shall we? ""i do not have to go back terribly far in history to prove this premise as being an outright falsehood. first, let's start with early 2020. as the spx proceeded to crash during the covid outbreak, did gold rally? nope. did gold at least remain stagnant? nope. in fact, gold proceeded to drop by 15% during that time. silver was even worse as it lost almost 40% of its value during that same timeframe."" gold is not supposed to rally in nominal terms during crises. it is supposed to retain relative value. this is what gold did in relative terms to spx during that crisis. after its relatively moderate nominal decline, gold led most markets out of the abyss before the inflationary bailout operations of central banks and governments set it up for a long correction as cyclical markets regained footing. that was as it should be for the anti-bubble. as for silver, it is not gold. i don't know why it is even included in this conversation.",2
2024-06-28,"silver is even further from an effective disaster hedge than gold, as it has more cyclical industrial qualities than gold (although it can be a better inflation hedge). now, if you are still not convinced, well, let's go back a bit further to the great financial crisis of 2008. again, did gold rally during this financial upheaval during which the perceived ""safety"" of gold was sorely needed? nope. did gold at least remain stagnant? nope. gold lost 30% of its value, which clearly outlined that you cannot rely upon gold as a hedge against stock market upheaval. and, again, silver was much worse as it lost 60% of its value during this time. gold got hammered during armageddon '08 (which for stocks, actually extended to q1 2009) but in relative terms it rose strongly vs. spx and rocketed higher vs. cyclical commodities like oil and base metals. it then went on to out and under perform periodically as cyclical inflation manifested out of the 2008 policy panic and subsequent years of zero interest rate policy (the financial blight known as zirp). but, clearly, history did not teach this lesson to everyone, as many completely ignored what occurred during this timeframe, and again expected gold to save them during the covid crisis. and the many that have still not learned this lesson now come back to prognosticate that gold will provide safety in the event the stock market turns down.",2
2024-06-28,"what is most interesting is that most of these same folks also maintain a world view that gold will not rally alongside the equity market. in fact, i just read another article which outlined this erroneous commonly held view, and claim surprise when it does rally alongside the equity market. the point with gold is its relative performance. nominally, it is going to go up or down as the prevailing winds and varied macro inputs (economic, policy both monetary and fiscal, inflation/deflation, disinflation, psychological/sentiment, etc) dictate. but the big picture macro is what is important. where has it been? where is it going? what is it indicating? as for the ""surprise"" of gold being correlated with asset markets lately, it is already noted above that gold is either being set up for price pressure when a broad bear market ensues or it is diverging to indicate the new macro. mr.a goes on to discuss what i have harped upon for many years, that gold is not usually an effective inflation hedge, at least during the pro-cyclical previous several decades. let's not dig that up again. anyone who bothered to look beyond the standard gold bug dogma already knows that. let's however, rebut one final point. ""my friends, at some point, one has to open their eyes and look at markets objectively. gold is not driven by inflation. nor is it driven by deflation. nor is it driven by the dollar. nor does it fall when the equity market rallies or vice versa. gold is driven by market sentiment.",2
2024-06-28,"and it is the only constant in the gold market which allows one to maintain an objective perspective on the price trend in gold, and be able to prognosticate that trend in any reliable and consistent manner."" gold's case should not be simplified to only sentiment unless we are discussing the very big macro picture. while sentiment is an important tool in managing an inherently emotional sector like the precious metals, it is far from the only consideration. mr.a is writing in linear fashion, as if the decades of the continuum's downtrend were still intact. the gold market going forward will respond to policy initiatives and constraints, economic acceleration or more likely in the few years ahead, deceleration. gold market sentiment is a knock-on effect of what is already happening. that is what sentiment is, a tail chasing the dog. the dog being macro fundamentals and technicals. notice i did not mention war, pestilence (the hard post-pandemic correction for gold was in the bag by mid-2020 due to damaging hype), china/india buying or any of the other common themes put forth as fundamentals for gold. boiling it down, gold is about policy and sentiment. aside from being a very long-term holder of real monetary value, gold is a barometer of mass confidence or lack thereof in policymakers in government and finance trying to regulate the economy and associated markets to desired and by definition, manipulated ends. so yes, gold is about sentiment.",2

2024-06-26,"no one else we know has done it for 8 years or so, not in public. and chen's findings now confound what we thought was going on at this spring's new all-time record high gold prices. our guess was that this year's rush into gold by its no.1 private-sector buyers must surely have included a surge in banking products backed by gold. first, that's because china is the most advanced nation on earth for everyone doing everything on mobile apps everywhere, including running their savings and investments. second, china's commercial banks reported huge growth in their customers' gold-linked account holdings when the no.1 consumer market really took off in 2010-2016. so this year's surge in gold coins, bars and even etf demand would have seen gold-linked banking products surge in size as well. third, and with bank-account holdings not covered by the data specialists who produce supply and demand figures for the gold market, how else can we explain the gap between china's visible inflows and offtake? no, this table doesn't include gold demand from the chinese central bank. and rightly not. on the official data, the people's bank of china bought 27 tonnes between january and march. but the pboc doesn't buy gold in china's domestic market (or so it says) and its purchases in, say, london don't show up in the import figures either, because 'monetary gold' is excluded from those numbers. so the chinese central bank doesn't show up on the demand side of our imbalanced balance above.",0
2024-06-26,"nor does our table have a line for china's scrap gold supply... ...not from old jewellery or micro-chips... ...because no one we know publishes data on that. so if anything, the supply-side of our table is too light. that only widens the gap between how much gold flows into private-sector circulation and how much the private sector actually buys. and that gap, according to chen long, wasn't filled by commercial banks selling gold-linked accounts to their customers. or rather, not a certain kind of gold-linked product at least. ""the recent reductions were triggered by the commercial banks cutting commodity-linked derivatives services for retail customers...the regulators and banks have been much more cautious...the then-chairman of the banking regulator publicly warned in 2021 that 'people who speculate on foreign exchange or gold will have a hard time getting rich.' the same year, several large banks moved to tighten services for retail investors to buy gold. some banks have completely suspended these services."" such caution and clampdowns aren't news. china, let's remember, is run by an unelected dictatorship which sees its own survival as vital to the long-term safety and security of the nation. that requires tight military, police and political controls.",0
2024-06-26,"it also means avoiding a financial crisis... ...such as the western world got in 2007-2012... ...because wiping out people's savings is never a good look, and...longer-term...an uncontrolled crash would most likely hurt long-term economic growth for the world's 2nd biggest population. that would, for starters, deprive younger chinese citizens of work... ...including, for instance, the 11 million people graduating from university this year now needing a job. cue the stern warnings from beijing this month about chinese government bonds. its central government debt isn't big. by value, the outstanding total equals less than a quarter of china's annual economic output, in fact. that contrasts with uk government debt-to-gdp of 101%, or italy at 140%, or the usa at 122%. but with gdp growth slowing as the real-estate sector slumps, that small pool of sovereign chinese debt has found ever-more eager buyers in china's massive financial sector.",0
2024-06-26,"and that has driven the price sharply higher... ...as shown by the yield which those bonds offer sinking ever lower as a percentage of the price which people are paying to buy. ""from a macro-prudential perspective,"" said people's bank boss pan gongsheng last week, ""we need to correct and block the accumulation of financial market risks in a timely manner."" most urgently, he warned, people buying bonds at these high prices risk a nasty crash...repeating last spring's silicon valley bank crash in the united states...when interest rates eventually go up and the price of those bonds comes down as a result. it's telling that pan fears an svb-style crisis. most banking crashes come when borrowers cannot service their debts, often because interest rates have risen since they took out their loans. but silicon valley blew up because it had struggled to find any borrowers... ...just like chinese lenders are currently struggling to find new borrowers... ...and so svb was sitting instead on a pile of customer deposits which it had to park somewhere. svb chose us government bonds, among other stuff, buying uncle sam's debt at what proved to be the very top of the covid catastrophe, back when yields were low and prices were high. by early 2023, the federal reserve had hiked interest rates from 0% to two-decade highs at 5% per annum. that meant bond yields also rose sharply. meaning that bond prices sank. making svb unable to pay its customers the cash they had put on deposit.",0
2024-06-26,"gold of course pays no yield. but its price, like china's government bonds, has jumped in 2024. so too has china's household and investor gold buying. maybe that's why the people's bank says it bought no gold in may, snapping an 18-month run of publicly-reported purchases at ever-higher prices. central-bank buying clearly encourages private investment. so if the pboc thinks gold has got too hot, too fast, maybe holding off for a month might take some of the heat out of household demand? either way, the clampdown on derivatives accounts linked to gold... ...where the investor is in fact betting on gold prices... ...or perhaps simply on 'unallocated' gold accounts, where the customer gets price exposure but no actual ownership... ...means that china's commercial banks need to own less gold to cover their lower exposure to lower customer participation. that is, of course, very different to what you enjoy by using bullionvault. here you are nobody's creditor and no-one owes you anything. instead, you own your gold (or silver, platinum or palladium) and nobody's financial troubles could deprive you of it. that's why, when you study our balance sheet, you will find only $46 million of gold, silver, platinum and palladium on our books ( page 40 of the 49-page pdf of 'group of companies' accounts' at companies house here) rather than the $4.5 billion in client holdings proven on the daily audit.",0
2024-06-26,"only a small chunk of the total belongs to bullionvault (and only so we can ensure there's an offer for you to buy whenever you wish 24/7). the vast bulk of the metal belongs to customers, not to bullionvault. so it doesn't appear on our balance sheet. maybe a switch to 'allocated' gold might help explain a little of china's deepening gold mystery? on chen's maths, comparing supply against demand, ""a total of 2,700 tonnes of gold has gone missing in china in the past two years...more than half of annual global gold production."" that is a lot. it's worth about us$200 billion... ""...so much that it is unlikely that one mysterious buyer holds all of it. there are several possibilities that could explain where it has gone."" chen's possibilities include the people's bank buying gold in the domestic market but not reporting it. or maybe china's sovereign wealth fund, china investment corporation, has been buying gold and not reporting it either. another possibility ""is that there are other buyers we do not see,"" he adds...again suggesting state-run demand. or maybe some investors have switched from domestic to foreign banks ""who also have gold import licenses [and] may have increased their [chinese] gold holdings without making disclosures."" or maybe, chen suggests, china's own commercial banks haven't cut their holdings as much as their quarterly reports suggest?",0
2024-06-26,"and maybe, we think here at bullionvault, that might be because their customers now want allocated gold, securely stored and insured in a vault in their name, rather than a credit risk or even derivatives product. look, china has, over the past couple of years, been living through a protracted real estate slump, something akin to a 'lehmans moment' of fear, doubt and mistrust, with the stock market almost halving in value from new year 2021 to february this year. the web of who owes what to whom remains impossible to untangle, right up until someone goes bust and their creditors have to tell their own creditors that the whole thing is unravelling. and just as the western world's 'global' financial crisis saw a surge in allocated gold investing after the lehmans' crisis had hit, so china is now facing the very real problem of who to stick with the losses from the past two decades of over-development and the 'ghost cities' it has left behind. who would want to 'buy' gold just to underwrite a bank's balance-sheet?",0

2024-06-21,"reaching the highest prices since 2011, silver has also beaten this year's other stellar investments to date, outpacing copper (up 14.5%) and even the nasdaq index of us tech stocks (up 19.1%) but lagging bitcoin (up 50.3%). making winners of investors choosing to buy silver ahead of this surge, these big 2024 gains come as silver's critical role in industry and new technologies – especially green energy – sees global demand for the precious metal outstrip new mining supply for the second year running. vital to solar energy panels as the conductive layer in photovoltaic cells, silver is also crucial in electrical networks and in electronics, too. analysts predict that demand for silver jewellery is also rising in 2024, along with demand for silver ornaments, cutlery and other silverware. the current henri delaunay trophy – named after the first general secretary of uefa – was made by london jewellers asprey in 2008. made from 8 kilograms of sterling silver, the cup contains £5,468 of bullion at today's prices. while it represents one of the world's most coveted trophies, it is lighter than the premier league trophy (9.5kg without its base) but slightly heavier than the uefa champions league trophy (7.5kg) or fa cup (6.3kg). altogether, users of bullionvault today own 1,164 tonnes of silver – worth £866 million today, and enough to make 157,380 euro trophies – all stored and insured inside high-security vaults.",0

2024-06-18,"annual price patterns in gold, silver, platinum article:20 years' precious metal prices changes by month as h2 2024 begins... precious metals analysts often speak about a seasonal shape in the gold market. that's because, over recent decades, gold prices have sometimes seen a rise in the new year and spring, followed by a summer drop or lull, and then a further rise into year-end. some analysts link that pattern to seasonal changes in global demand for gold. they see those price changes leading what happens to silver and platinum prices between january and december, too. after surging to new all-time us dollar highs in march, april and may this year, might the second half of 2024 repeat the more seasonally typical pattern? the infographics below show you how gold prices have moved across the calendar year over the last two decades. the first chart lets you count how many times, over the last 20 years, each month showed a gain for gold in either us dollar terms, or euros, british pounds or japanese yen. the second infographic then shows you the last 20 years' average monthly price change for gold in those 4 major currencies, too. whatever pattern you might or might not see in the chart, consumer gold demand does have a clear seasonal pattern. demand in china – now the world's heaviest gold consumer nation, outpacing former no.1 india 15% by weight each year – peaks with chinese new year.",0
2024-06-18,"that's followed by valentine's day, and then the festive season of akshaya tritiya in southern india. the summer brings a lack of festivals or weddings on india's hindu calendars, before household demand in the no.2 consumer nation jumps in the run-up to diwali. followed by christmas – the peak gifting season across europe and the americas – that then runs into retailer stockpiling for the chinese new year again. consumer demand is not the only factor which can affect gold prices however. rising assets tend to require inflows of investor cash, both driving and chasing prices higher. with that in mind, check out january's track record for rising precious metal prices. because, as our interactive chart shows, gold has risen 14 times at new year in us dollar terms since 2004. silver rose 13 times and platinum has risen more repeatedly still, up 17 times in the last 20 januarys. so the new year clearly invites strong investing into precious metals. here at bullionvault, in fact – the world's largest online investment service for physical precious metals – january has repeatedly seen more new bullion investors than the following year's monthly average, and it was the very best month of the year for new account openings 3 times in the last decade. why this repeated surge of interest at new year? gold may benefit because investors use the start of january to review their portfolio and rebalance their holdings of bullion, equities and bonds.",0
2024-06-18,"january may also bring heavy demand to invest in gold because – looking at the 12 months ahead – wealth managers and private savers alike focus on potential risks to their money. so they choose to buy a little investment insurance for protection. that would help explain why january is the best single month for gold gains over the last 20 years for us dollar investors, matched only by november's strike rate between 2004 and 2023. but november doesn't come close to january's average monthly gain, lagging the new year's figure of 2.9% with an average 1.6% rise. even so, note also that december is catching up. over the last decade in fact, it now matches january's strike rate, with the gold price in dollar terms rising 7 times. maybe that reflects wholesalers buying in china, preparing for lunar new year demand by stockpiling metal sooner than later. perhaps it also reflects short-term traders spotting the january bump and buying early, effectively betting on a repeat of the seasonal pattern. past performance is no guarantee of future performance, of course. and what drives this new year pop in bullion prices isn't 100% clear either. but history says that, over the last 2 decades on average, early summer made a good time to buy gold, as well as silver or platinum, ahead of solid gains later in the year and then that repeated rise in january.",0

2024-06-13,"the $12,000 ev vs. tesla article:what biden's tariffs on china mean... the biden administration announced significant tariff increases on china, writes frank holmes at us global investors. targeting roughly $18 billion in strategic industries, there's a sharp focus on electric vehicles (evs). these tariffs, which quadruple to 100% on chinese-made evs, are designed to counter china's unfair trade practices and overcapacity while boosting us industries. the move also aims to strengthen president biden's lagging poll numbers heading into the november presidential election. for decades, china has moved to dominate various industries, from toys and clothing in the 1980s to semiconductors and renewable energy today. as of now, china produces a third of the world's manufactured goods, surpassing the combined output of the us, germany, japan, south korea and the uk this industrial might has given china a trade surplus in manufactured goods equal to a 10th of its entire economy. the world's second largest economy was a minor player in car exports just four years ago, shipping about 1 million low-priced vehicles annually to less affluent markets. today, china has surged past japan and germany to become the world's biggest car exporter, with shipments running at an annual pace of nearly 6 million vehicles. china's car exports, in fact, hit a record high in april, with a year-on-year increase of 38%. as for evs, domestic chinese sales have been strong and are growing.",0

2024-06-13,"through the chips and science act and the inflation reduction act, biden has already provided support to american companies in sectors like semiconductors and renewable energy. the tariff increases on china are an extension of that protection, ensuring that american businesses can compete on a more level playing field. as i said earlier, we should view biden's actions through the lens of the upcoming us presidential election. president biden is trailing former president donald trump in national polls, including in several swing states, and this move is likely aimed at rallying support among voters who are concerned about job losses and industrial decline. having said all that, tariffs are not ideal instruments, and i believe they should be used sparingly. it's important to remember that tariffs are taxes paid not by the exporting country – china in this case – but by importers, which pass the additional cost on to domestic consumers. biden's tariffs could also have unintended consequences on the nation's efforts to decarbonize its grid, warns the atlantic council, a washington, dc-based think tank. china is the largest exporter of lithium-ion batteries to the us, which are crucial for grid storage that complements solar power. depending on the details of the tariffs, us efforts to transition to renewable energy could face slowdowns if storage capacity is impacted. another factor to consider is the declining consumer demand for evs in the us according to the j.d.",0

2024-06-12,"how the bond market works article:or how it should, amid excess credit, capital shortage... the author and journalist michael lewis claims that when he wrote 'liar's poker', which was published 35 years ago, he meant it as a cautionary tale, writes tim price of price value partners. the book happens to be required reading, not just for anyone seeking an insight into the ways of wall street in the late 1980s, but simply for anyone, full stop. it's a terrific read, and it charts a period during which something approximating to 'gentlemanly capitalism' was taken over, wholesale; first by street-smart traders from the likes of the bronx and london's east end, and then by quantitative analysts (geeks, in other words, but with phds). it also details a period during which the bond market started to dominate every other facet of the investment world. ""i used to think that if there was reincarnation,"" said clinton political adviser james carville once, ""i wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. ""but now i want to come back as the bond market. you can intimidate everybody."" 'liar's poker' portrays a world in which cunning slobs stole dealing rooms from under the noses of patrician blue-bloods born on the right side of the tracks. if that implies chaos, that's exactly right. but cautionary tale? the book became 'must-read' material for an entire generation of undergraduates on both sides of the atlantic.",2
2024-06-12,"it acted like a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking up mathematicians and philosophy students and economics third-years and liberal arts graduates, and spitting them back out across dealing rooms in new york and london's square mile. for all we know, it still does. this correspondent speaks as an english graduate whose first job, courtesy of exposure to 'liar's poker', was – like michael lewis – selling bonds for an international investment bank. the bond market may be intimidating, but it shouldn't be. a bond is about the most basic financial instrument you could imagine. think of a loan that happens to be tradable, daily. that's a bond. so let's put some more meat on the bone. who issues bonds? anyone that needs to borrow money. that means governments, corporations, and supranational borrowers like the world bank. entities, especially private companies, often prefer to borrow in the bond market because they don't want to dilute existing shareholders by means of issuing equity. us companies also often prefer to issue bonds as opposed to stock because the interest on bonds is deductible on the company's income tax return. dividends on stock are not. the bond market is an almost entirely institutional market. private investors barely feature – not least because the average traded size for a bond deal in the secondary market is approximately $5 million or so. how do bonds get issued? in a way that's very similar to equity underwriting.",2
2024-06-12,"a consortium of investment banks will gauge the market's level of interest in the issue by speaking to their clients – large pension funds, insurers, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. when they've assessed the market's demand for the issue, the size of the borrowing will be agreed, and its price, and then the bonds will be free to trade. voila. bond math is pretty straightforward, too. let's take a real world example. (market professionals can skip the next few paragraphs.) a corporate issuer – let's call them 'general industrial' – decides to borrow $5 billion in the bond market at an interest rate of 5%, maturing in 10 years' time, on 3rd june 2034. let's say you're a pension fund and you decide to buy $1 million worth of the issue at launch. you will pay 100% of the bond's face value, or what's known as par. so the stream of cash flows looks as follows: launch date: you pay general industrial (or more specifically, the investment bank from whom you bought the bond) $1000,000. 3rd june 2025: general industrial pays you $50,000 (5% of your $1000,000). 3rd june 2026: general industrial pays you another $50,000. 3rd june 2027: general industrial pays you another $50,000...(you get the picture). ...and on 3rd june 2034, general industrial pays you a last coupon payment of $50,000 – and it also pays you your original principal of $1000,000 back. as you can see from this example, bond interest payments, or what are called coupons, are typically fixed.",2
2024-06-12,"and the redemption of your initial capital is fixed, too, at 100%. this means that in a high inflation environment, bonds are generally poor investments. the converse is also true. in a deflationary environment, where prices are actually falling, bonds are generally great investments, because the purchasing power of your capital is actually improving, relative to those falling prices. it's important to know that you're not locked in to holding this bond until it matures in june 2034. you can sell it any time you like. although the coupon is only paid once a year (bonds typically pay annual or semi-annual coupons), if you decide to sell it before the coupon date, you'll be compensated for any accrued interest that you've earned but not been paid. and it's also critically important to know that if general industrial is unable to pay the interest it owes you, or to repay the initial capital when the bond matures, you may lose everything. for this reason, almost all bonds carry a credit rating from a major ratings agency like moody's or standard & poor's. credit ratings range from 'aaa' (impeccable) all the way down to 'd' – meaning the company is in default. 'investment grade ratings' (the best sort) range from 'aaa' to 'bbb-'. anything below that is considered 'junk', or more politely, 'high yield'. so what influences the price of bonds?",2
2024-06-12,"the major factors are: the likely direction of future interest rates; the likely direction of inflation; supply and demand for the bonds in question; and the perceived credit quality of the issuer. one final word on bond math. there is one thing close to an iron law in economics. if interest rates go up, bond prices typically fall. (the converse is also true.) why? remember, those interest payments, or coupons, are typically fixed. the capital amount returned when the bond matures is also fixed, too. so if interest rates rise while you're holding the bond, the value of those fixed payments essentially is diminished in real terms. but because the bond trades every day, bond traders can adjust the price of the bond, which in turn will adjust the yield that the bond offers. if you buy that general industrial bond at a price of 100 when it's issued, because the coupon is fixed at 5%, your yield will be 5%, too. over its life, if the price falls below 100, your yield (what bond traders call 'yield to maturity') will rise. and clearly, if investors raise their opinion of general industrial's credit quality, then the price of the bonds is likely to rise too. but the critical point is the one we just made: if interest rates go up, bond prices typically fall. before we leave the subject of bonds altogether, it's also worth saying a few words about the nature of bond fund managers. institutional bond funds typically invest on an indexed or benchmarked basis.",2
2024-06-12,"that is to say, they will tend to own bonds in line with the make-up of an accredited bond index, such as the jp morgan government bond index. think about that one more time. a bond fund tracking a bond index is effectively obliged to have its largest positions in the largest bond markets. this is a bit like saying you can lend to one of two friends. one of your friends wants to borrow $10, and is good for the loan. the other wants to borrow $1000,000 – and is frankly unlikely to pay it back. you are obliged to make the loan to your second friend, who's clearly a credit risk. welcome to the perverse and dangerous logic of international bond investing. we think this will end in tears. a modern economy is clearly a complex structure, so rather than have to get a phd in advanced economics just to conduct credit research on any given government bond market, most investors leave the credit analysis to the likes of those ratings agencies, moody's, standard & poor's, and fitch ibca. but at the risk of appearing overly deferential to those same agencies, the subprime mortgage disaster showed that they can have feet of clay. collateralised debt obligations (packages of subprime loans) were rated 'aaa' one day and defaulted the next. so for the avoidance of any doubt, take credit ratings with more than a pinch of salt. remember that credit ratings agencies are paid by the same borrowers for whom they provide credit ratings – a larger conflict of interest would be difficult to imagine.",2
2024-06-12,"if you're in need of a further jolt of realism, visit the us debt clock. the site confirms that the us national debt now stands at just under $35 trillion. with a 't'. that equates to debt per taxpayer of roughly $267,000. that's the good news. when you factor in the unfunded liabilities of the us government (the likes of social security and medicare), the us debt comes to well over $200 trillion. also with a 't'. we humbly submit that these debts will not be paid back. they cannot be paid back. the us national debt is like a neutron star: an incalculably dense mass that crushes everything that comes towards it. but ratings agency fitch cheerfully gives the us a credit rating of 'aa+', its second highest rating. ominously, though, it downgraded the us from its highest rating of 'aaa' in august 2023. with hindsight it made absolute sense to buy us treasuries in the early 1980s, for example. the oil shocks of the 1970s had given rise to years of stagflation and it was only fed chairman paul volcker's determination to squeeze inflation out of the system through the tough love of higher interest rates that brought bond markets back under control. and how. starting in 1982, treasury yields started to drop (bond yields move inversely to bond prices – so lower yields means a bond market rally), and they fell precipitously. by mid-2020, 10 year us treasury yields were trading below 1%. but that was then.. they are now back above 4% – and we think they are heading higher.",2
2024-06-12,"the market consensus does not agree with us. but there's worse news to come. treasury yields are only as low as they are due to the federal reserve's policy of quantitative easing (qe). qe was ""designed"" as a means of boosting the economy through the provision of additional liquidity into the banking system. the fed would create 'ex nihilo' money – money out of thin air – and use it to buy bonds in the secondary market from the banks. gifted free cash through these bond sales, the banks would then lend out this newly created cash to those who wanted to borrow. that was the theory. in practice, all that's really happened is that qe has blessed a small proportion of the population – those lucky individuals fortunate or successful enough to hold large amounts of financial assets. qe has been an extraordinary boon to the asset rich. equity prices, bond prices, housing prices have all benefited from a colossal leakage of money from the banking system into the financial markets. but this leakage has now been officially ended. this doesn't mean that interest rates are immediately going to rise. but the formal cessation of the latest round of qe is equivalent to a sea change in us monetary policy. at some point, interest rates must rise. and to repeat, if interest rates go up, bond prices tend to fall. and because the west is drowning in bonds, the impact of a bear market in bonds is incalculable.",2
2024-06-12,"if you accept our argument that the investment world is beset by a type of uncertainty genuinely never seen before – one that incorporates interest rate risk, default risk and currency risk on a literally global scale – then it makes sense to hold a type of asset that is either unexposed to those risks or that offers the potential to insure your portfolio against them. that asset is gold. ""we have an abundance of money and credit..."" writes our friend tony deden, a money manager in zurich, ""...but a shortage of capital. we have sought to substitute form over substance, credit over savings, and consumption over production. we have eaten our capital...we live in dismal times and we suffer from a moral crisis, both being consequences of a [50-year old] experiment in dishonest money.

2024-06-12,"one of tony's directors once made a highly pertinent observation about what gold actually is: ""gold is not an investment. it is a conscious decision to refrain from investing until an honest monetary regime makes the rational calculation of relative asset prices possible."" suffice to say, the return of an honest monetary regime may be some time off. but precisely because we don't know what the future holds, and because the threats to our purchasing power are numerous and very real, we maintain that gold has a place in any balanced portfolio today. incrementum ag: ""one of our central theses of recent years is now being slowly but surely confirmed: (government) bonds are no longer the antifragile portfolio foundation they have been for the last 40 years. after yields reached a microscopically low level in 2020 and were even negative in some cases, 10-year us treasuries fell in value by 22.8%, while 30-year bonds even fell by 48.8% from their peak. the frontrunners in the negative sense are naturally the 100-year austrian bonds, which are down 69.1 % (maturity 2120) from their respective highs. ""it almost seems as if the bond vigilantes are back. coined by ed yardeni in 1983, the term refers to activist investors who indirectly control government policy by buying and selling government bonds. these ""financial sheriffs"" send a clear signal against excessive government debt and inflation by driving up interest rates through the sale of bonds.",2
2024-06-12,"today, in a time of financial repression and open central bank interventionism, their role may seem weakened. but the bond vigilantes are not obsolete – they are adapting to the new market realities and remain an important corrective to fiscal slippage. ""a historical example of the impact of bond vigilantes was the bond market reaction to the overexpansive fiscal policy of the reagan era in the early 1980s. higher deficits led to a rise in government bond yields, which ultimately prompted the government to tighten its budget policy. another example is the european sovereign debt crisis in the early 2010s, when investors questioned the creditworthiness of southern european countries and drastically increased the interest burden for these countries by selling piigs bonds. ""and the playbook is likely to have changed not only for gold but also for bonds. recently, us government bonds have increasingly exhibited characteristics of traditional risk-on investments. in times of financial unrest, their yields rose – a clear contrast to the previous trading pattern that dominated for decades. this new behaviour is reminiscent of the performance of emerging-market government bonds, which are traditionally more sensitive to global risk sentiment. this transformation marks a significant departure from the previous role of [us treasuries] as a safe haven, and it requires a rethink in strategic allocation."" in common with incrementum, we think much has changed.",2

2024-06-10,"the consensus holds that there is no way to stop this decay of purchasing power to near-zero – ie, hyperinflation – once it starts. as in a greek tragedy, the fatal flaw of the protagonist – in this case, fiat currency – leads inevitably to its destruction. in the real world, things having to do with money tend to occur because they benefit powerful interests. this leads us to ask of hyperinflation cui bono, to whose benefit? exactly which powerful interests benefit when a currency's purchasing power plummets to near-zero? the idea here is that there will be pushback if it doesn't benefit the wealthy and powerful. so either hyperinflation somehow benefits the wealthy and powerful, or it escapes their control and wipes them out along with the powerless commoners. that raises the question: didn't the wealthy and powerful see what was coming and couldn't they have reversed the policies generating hyperinflation? if not, why not? there are a couple of different threads to follow here. one is that capital is what matters to the wealthy and powerful because they own the vast majority of it while credit is what matters to the poor, as credit is their only way to acquire a bit of capital to invest in their own enterprise/household. the poor owe debt, the wealthy own debt: debt (such as a home mortgage) is an asset to the wealthy, who buy the loan for its income stream, while debt is a liability to the commoners that must be serviced out of their earned income.",0
2024-06-10,"if wages rise in parallel with high rates of inflation, those who owe debt find their burdens lightened as their mortgage payment remains fixed while their income rises with inflation. imagine how cheering it is when one finds a once-onerous $200,000 mortgage can now be paid off with a month's salary due to hyperinflation. on the flip side, the wealthy and powerful who own the debt are less delighted, as the purchasing power of the currency used to pay off the mortgage has diminished, effectively robbing them of most of the value of their original purchase of the mortgage. where the $200,000 they paid for the mortgage could have bought two nice luxury vehicles, the $200,000 they now receive in full payment can barely buy a used clunker. this raises an interesting question: why on earth would the wealthy and powerful let hyperinflation destroy the value of all their debt-based assets and income streams? isn't that completely counter to their interests? if so, why would they let that happen? at this juncture it's important to draw a distinction between ancient examples of hyperinflation and the present-day economy. in the declining era of the roman empire, the government drastically reduced the silver content in the coinage to generate the illusion that everyone was still being paid in full with only a fraction of the silver contained in old coinage.",0
2024-06-10,"this artifice was quickly uncovered, and old coinage disappeared from circulation due to hoarding and inflation caused prices and wages to soar. the difference is back then, the poor owned virtually nothing. today, the poor ""own"" debt service: they owe interest and principal on the vast quantities of debt owned by the wealthy, who will lose out when the values of their debt-based assets crash to near-zero in hyperinflation. hyperinflation is incredibly beneficial to debtors with earned income and incredibly destructive to those who own the debt being wiped out. this leads to a second thread: the wealthy shift their wealth overseas as inflation picks up and wait for the hyperinflationary storm to wipe out the value of literally everything in their home economy, at which point they return, foreign cash in hand, to scoop up all the best assets at fire-sale prices. this certainly works on small developing-world economies, but it doesn't work in large economies such as the us' with $156 trillion in assets to convert into other nation's currencies and assets. in large economies, the wealth of powerful elites is generated by a functioning economy that produces goods and services and maintains a stable currency. buying a castle and some gold overseas is not a replacement for productive capital that generates income and capital gains.",0
2024-06-10,"wiping out the value of the nation's currency also destroys its value as a reserve currency and in global trade, two additional disasters the wealthy and powerful would seek to avoid at all costs. if we tot up the winners and losers of hyperinflation, the commoners who owe debt win as long as wages rise with inflation, while the wealthy and powerful lose out. given the vast asymmetry of wealth and power, do you really think this is going to happen? what seems more likely because it serves the interests of the wealthy and powerful is interest rates on sovereign bonds soar, enabling the wealthy who sold off all their risk assets such as stocks and commercial real estate to earn a healthy, low-risk return in treasuries. the central bank is ordered to stop ""printing money"" and the government cuts spending across the board, leading to howls of outrage but since the interests of the wealthy and powerful are at stake, too bad, suck it up, kids, everyone takes a cut. risk assets deflate, the purchasing power of the commoners' debt service stabilizes and the ensuing deflation only hurts those who didn't bail out of speculative risk assets at the top and stash the cash in short-term treasuries. then, when rates max out, the smart money shifts capital into long-term sovereign bonds and waits for the deflation to send risk asset prices to the basement. then the long-term bonds can be liquidated for cash, and the deflated assets scooped up at fire-sale prices.",0
2024-06-10,"if we ask cui bono, which scenario is more likely: hyperinflation or a deflationary crushing of risk assets and soaring interest rates? yes, a bunch of zombie/marginal borrowers will default, and those holding the debt will be wiped out, but all that is foreseeable and can be remedied by selling when everyone is bullish on real estate and risk assets. as for the commoners, deflating prices increase the purchasing power of their wages. those with little or no debt will benefit from deflation, as their wages will go further and they'll finally be able to afford risk assets once prices return to pre-bubble levels. as for interest rates, we all paid 12% mortgages in the early 1980s and life went on because the loans were modest in size compared with today's bloated everything bubble. other than china, it doesn't appear that global money supply is going parabolic. and as this chart indicates, inflation is tolerated as long as it's stretched over a century and wages rise along with prices. when predicting the future, we're best served by following what benefits the wealthy and powerful, as that is the likeliest outcome. is hyperinflation a ""solution""? not to the wealthy and powerful.",0
2024-06-07,"barbarous gold is back article:no one wants a gold standard again. but... elites are extremely hostile to the idea that gold should have any role whatsoever in the monetary system, says jim rickards in the daily reckoning. to them, gold is truly a barbarous relic, as john maynard keynes was supposed to have said. you might as well propose bringing back the horse and buggy. except keynes never said gold was a barbarous relic. what he did say was more interesting. in his 1924 book monetary reform, keynes in fact wrote, ""the gold standard is already a barbarous relic."" keynes was discussing not gold, but the gold standard. there might not seem to be a difference, but there is. in the 1924 context, he was right. the classical gold standard ended in 1914 with the outbreak of wwi. to pay for the war, combatants printed massive amounts of money. after the war many wanted to return to the prewar gold standard. in 1925, for example, the british exchequer was winston churchill. he wanted to return to the old gold price, ignoring the fact that the wartime money printing demanded a much higher gold price. he in effect overvalued the pound. keynes told churchill this would be a deflationary disaster. if britain was to go back on a gold standard, it would have to set the gold price higher. but churchill ignored his advice. the result was massive deflation and depression in great britain, years before depression struck the rest of the world.",1
2024-06-07,"the notoriously flawed gold exchange standard that prevailed until 1939 should never have been adopted, and should have been eliminated before wwii did the job. these days, there isn't a central bank in the world that wants to go back to a gold standard (though many are hoarding gold themselves). but that's not the point. the question is whether they will have to. i've had conversations with several federal reserve bank presidents. when you ask them point-blank, ""is there a theoretical limit to the fed's balance sheet?"" they say no. they say there are policy reasons to make it higher or lower, but that there's no limit to the amount of money you can print. that's completely wrong. that's what they say; that's how they think; and that's how they act. but in their heart of hearts, some people at the fed know it's wrong. luckily, people can vote with their feet. i always tell people who say we're not on the gold standard that, in a way, we are. you can put yourself on a personal gold standard just by buying gold. in other words, if you think that the value of paper money will be in some jeopardy, or confidence in paper money may be lost, one way to protect yourself is by buying gold. and there's nothing stopping you. the typical response is, ""what's the point of owning gold? they're just going to confiscate it, like roosevelt did in 1933."" i find that extremely unlikely. in 1933, we'd just come through four years of the great depression, and roosevelt was new in office.",1

2024-06-07,"if some scenarios play out, you are going to see the price of gold rocket to the moon. and it may happen in a very short time. you shouldn't expect a steady, gradual increase. gold may to drift along sideways, going nowhere for a period. then you'll see a spike, then another spike and then a super-spike. it could happen within months. at that point, gold becomes a major force. ultimately i expect gold to reach $15,000 an ounce or more. that figure isn't made up. i didn't come up with it to be provocative. it's a product of the actual math. they're the numbers you get when you simply divide the money supply by the amount of gold in the market. under some scenarios, gold could even reach $27,000. there are many variables in play. when the super-spike happens, you're going to have two americas. you're going to have one america that was not prepared. paper savings will be wiped out; 401(k)s will be devalued; pensions, insurance and annuities will be devalued through inflation. that's because it's not just the price of gold going up. it's the dollar going down. gold is just an indicator. it's like taking the temperature of a patient with a fever and blaming it on the thermometer when it reads 104. the thermometer's not to blame for the fever; it's just telling you what's going on. likewise, the price of gold isn't an economic object or aim in itself; it's a price signal. it tells you what's going on in the economy.",1
2024-06-07,"and gold at the levels i'm talking about would mean that you've now verged into hyperinflation, or something close to it, because nothing happens in isolation. once expectations shift toward inflation, which is happening, it can be dramatic. though the rate of inflation has reduced since peaking in june 2022, inflation's not going away. people are now beginning to sense that. still, central banks will never voluntarily return to a gold standard. but if gold is such a barbarous relic, if gold has no role in the monetary system, if gold is a ""stupid"" investment, then why are the russians and chinese, among others, stockpiling gold hand over fist? are they stupid? well, i've spoken with many of them and i can assure you they're not stupid. but if there's a run on paper currencies (which is entirely possible) or borderline hyperinflation (also possible), central banks may have to go to a gold standard. not because they want to, but because they find it necessary to calm the markets. i suggest you buy your gold at current levels – around $2360 – and ride the wave up to much higher levels. it'll protect your wealth in the days ahead. like every market, it will fluctuate. nothing goes up in a straight line. but you want to focus on the longer-term picture. and it looks very bright for gold. so i invite you to go on your own personal gold standard. one day, the rest of the world may join you.",1

""six new large mines need to come online every year by 2050 to meet global copper demand,"" adds a mining mechanic, ""but the problem is it takes about 20 years between discovering a new copper mineral deposit and getting a permit to build a mine. none of this takes into consideration the upgrades to the electrical infrastructure needed to 'electrify' the world by 2050."" so in short, he concludes, ""electrifying the world by 2050 is a politician's pipe dream that will never happen."" hence the recent surge in copper prices, driven by talk of structural and unfixable market deficits between supply and demand in the decades ahead.",0

2024-05-29,"japan's big problem article:fixing this gets harder as the problems roll on... in the last twenty years, japan's government could have sallied forth and fixed a lot of the problems that have been accumulating over the years, writes nathan lewis in this update on japan penned in 2023 and published on his new world economics blog. mostly, this has been intensifying welfare/social security/healthcare burdens, on a weakening economic base. despite the tendency of governments to adopt an ""austerity"" response here, which mostly means higher taxes, the solution is rather, tax reform which results in lower tax rates, although the revenue/gdp ratio may remain unchanged. but a much healthier economy would lead to rising gdp, and thus more tax revenue. on the spending side, the main problem, just as in the us and most other developed countries, is legacy social programs, including needs-based welfare, public pensions (social security) and healthcare systems that are much too expensive and burdensome. a much better solution has been found by governments such as singapore, which relies primarily upon provident fund systems. these are basically private accounts with mandatory contributions, similar to payroll taxes but you get the money in an account owned by you. singapore has no public pension (social security) system, but relies on a provident fund system that amounts to a mandatory 401(k)-type program. over a lifetime, even people of modest income can amass quite a lot of assets.",1
2024-05-29,"there are still needs-based welfare systems for seniors who find that these private accounts prove insufficient. but, the number of such people is small. also, because there aren't a lot of spending programs, taxes are low (singapore's revenue/gdp ratio is about 14%), which means a strong economy, which means that wages are higher and it is easier to accumulate assets, such as home ownership. thus, people are wealthier, in general, upon retirement, or even can continue working at a higher wage if they prefer. also, as people die, they leave more assets to their children, including any provident fund retirement assets that they did not use. these inheritors are themselves often close to retirement, so they enjoy a quick bump-up in retirement assets from their parents. although japan's healthcare system is, i would say, not bad (compared to the disaster in the us), nevertheless singapore's market-based system is much better – accomplishing better outcomes at about half the price. this too has a provident fund system, or what amounts to health savings accounts with mandatory contributions. singapore has the same pattern of aging population and low fertility as japan, but none of the fiscal problems. its systems are much better suited for our time. japan's government could have spent the last two decades adopting a model something like this, but of course they instead played smoke-and-mirrors with government financing, while allowing all other problems to fester and worsen.",1

2024-05-23,"i get email from readers about defending the constitution, something we all support. i'm not an attorney, but my impression of constitutional law is that it is a tediously complex thicket of case law that must be carefully picked through before we can even begin to understand exactly what we're defending: every issue anyone might be concerned about has already accumulated an immense load of rulings and arguments. this is american jurisprudence: advocacy goes to trial and rulings are issued, some as rulings that will pertain to all future cases and some that will not. the law advances in new fields such as ai as positions are argued before judges/juries and then reviewed by higher courts as losers appeal judgments/rulings. a great many things we might think are novel have long been settled. isn't the selective service act a form of involuntary servitude? nope, that's been settled long ago. the government's right to draft you to fight in a war of choice is unquestionably the law of the land. ai has certain novel features that have yet to be decided by the processes of advocacy, rulings and appeals. in general, corporations selling/giving away ai tools are claiming these tools incur no liability to the issuers of the tools because they're akin to software that, for example, adds html coding to plain text: a tool that performs a process. this strikes me as incomplete.",2
2024-05-23,"it seems to me that ai, by its very name and nature, is making implicit claims of utility far beyond mere processing of data or text: ai is called ai because it is adding intellectual value to data or text. all the disclaimers in the world cannot dissolve this implicit claim of utility that adds value. since i'm not an attorney, i'm not able to put this in proper legal terms; i'm using the terminology of philosophy. but the law is a system based on philosophic principles, and so the language of philosophy plays a key role in broadly applicable legal rulings. is all this too abstract? then let's consider a real-world example. a patient receives a misdiagnosis and suffers as a direct result of the misdiagnosis. in our system of law, somebody or some entity is liable for the consequences of the error, and must pay restitution to those harmed by the error. as fact-finding proceeds, it turns out an ai tool was used in the initial scanning of the patient's data. the company that created the ai tool will naturally claim that the tool was intended only to be used under the supervision of a human professional, and there were no claims made as to the accuracy of the ai tool's output. this is a specious argument, as the clear intent of the ai tool is to replace human expertise as a means of lowering the costs of diagnosis by accelerating the process and increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis.",2
2024-05-23,"clearly, the tool was designed for exactly this purpose, and therefore deficiencies in its performance that contributed to the misdiagnosis – for example, the fact that the ai tool rated the diagnostic result with a high probability of accuracy – are the responsibility of the company that issued the ai tool. should the court find the ai company 1% liable for the misdiagnosis, the principle of joint and several liability means the monetary settlement falls on whichever parties can pay the settlement. should the other parties found liable be unable to pay a $10 million settlement, then the ai company might end up paying $9 million of the $10 million settlement, despite their apparently limited liability. off the top of my head, i can foresee dozens of similar examples in which an ai tool can be found partially liable for misrepresentations, errors of omission, unauthorized use of confidential intellectual property and so on, in what can easily become an endless profusion of liability claims. if the bloom is off the rose of big tech, the likelihood of a court assigning liability to those issuing ai tools increases proportionately. if the ruling is upheld by an appeals court, it will generally enter case law and become the basis for similar lawsuits assigning liability to those entities issuing ai tools. that real harm will result from the use of ai tools is a given.",2
2024-05-23,"the idea that those issuing these tools should be given a free pass because ""we really didn't mean that you could use the tools to reduce human labor and increase accuracy"" does not pass the sniff test, nor will it negate advocacy claiming that these tools implicitly make claims about utility that incur liability. use an ai tool, get sued. the wild west of ai's claims of zero liability will soon enter the meat grinder of jurisprudence, and implicit claims of utility will be more than enough to incur liability in a court of law – as they should. the legal spear in ai's back could prove fatal. a 1% error rate and 1% liability will add up fast.",2
2024-05-21,"trump's dollar plan: currency peace, not war article:think plaza and louvre, not the 1970s... there has been a lot reported in recent days about the return of currency wars, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. this story arises in the context of a likely trump election victory in the november presidential elections. trump badly bungled his transition after first being elected president in 2016. he wasn't ready with a long list of loyal appointees. many of his senior appointments such as rex tillerson as secretary of state, james mattis as secretary of defense and john kelly as chief of staff secretly disliked trump but accepted their roles as so-called ""adult supervision"" around the supposedly reckless trump. they thwarted his agenda. that backstabbing came on top of the large number of obama holdovers in the deep state who saw themselves as a ""resistance"" movement. trump is doing a better job of preparing for a second term as president, but the resistance isn't sitting still either. they're moving to disable a new trump administration even before the election. the currency wars stories are part of that effort. as reported by the washington post, politico, the wall street journal, yahoo finance and other outlets, trump's working on a secret plan to devalue the us dollar. the goal would be to cheapen us exports and thereby help the us balance of trade and create exported-related jobs.",2
2024-05-21,"but the critics say this will only increase us inflation as americans have to pay more for their imported goods using cheaper dollars. the critics also say that other countries will retaliate against the us by cheapening their own currencies (that's the essence of a currency war) and no country will be any further ahead. in fact, the entire world will be worse off. before looking more closely at what's actually going on, some basics about a currency war should be explained. the first rule is that the world is not always in a currency war. the periods from 1944-1971 (the original bretton woods era) and 1987-2010 (the period of the washington consensus) were times of currency peace. this contrasts with 1921-1936 (currency war i), 1967-1987 (currency war ii) and the current period since 2010 (currency war iii). the second rule is that currency wars can last for 15 years or longer. it comes as no surprise that the currency war that commenced in 2010 is still going strong 14 years later in 2024. and that points to another key aspect of this debate. the currency war being written about today by the media is not a new currency war. it's the same one that has been going on since 2010. we're simply in a new phase or a new battle. it is true that cheapening your currency can import inflation.",2
2024-05-21,"sometimes that's a legitimate policy goal if your country has been suffering from excessive deflation (gradual, moderate consumer price deflation caused by greater market efficiency and competition is economically beneficial). that's obviously not the case in the us today. it's also true that cheapening your currency can export deflation as trading partners pay less for your goods. that's what china was doing to the entire world from 1994-2010 and that's why the us launched a currency war in 2010 – to fight back against disinflation and borderline deflation caused by cheap chinese goods. currency wars can also shift jobs overseas and destroy domestic manufacturing as the terms of trade shift based on changing currency values. retaliation is always waiting right around the corner in any currency war. the us dollar hit an all-time low in august 2011, which was consistent with the us goal of trying to import inflation. but europe struck back, and the eur/usd cross-rate crashed from $1.60 to $1.04 as a result. so it is correct that no one wins a currency war, and everyone is damaged in the process due to volatility, uncertainty and the costs of conducting the war. so are the critics right that trump has a secret plan to devalue the dollar? and are they right that this new stage in the currency war will bring inflation and hurt the us economy? the critics are wrong and don't understand what trump's actually trying to do.",2
2024-05-21,"trump isn't trying to start a currency war; he's trying to end it once and for all. in the first place, no president has the power to unilaterally devalue the dollar. that might have been possible under the gold standard or some standard of fixed exchange rates, but that hasn't been the state of the world since 1973. exchange rates fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates, industrial growth, exchange controls, central bank interventions, capital flows, tax rates and many other macroeconomic variables. but the idea that the president can just wave his hand and devalue the dollar is false. far from the reckless, inflationary process the media claim, trump's actual plan is based on the highly successful model developed by james baker for ronald reagan and implemented in the plaza accord of 1985 and the louvre accord of 1987. after the severe economic recession of 1982 and paul volcker's policy of moving interest rates to 20%, inflation in the us was finally reigned in. inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 6.1% in 1982 and then 3.2% in 1983. investment in the us went on a tear. us real growth was 16% from 1983-1986. everyone wanted dollars to invest in the us and the dollar boomed reaching an all-time high in 1985. finally, the reagan administration decided the us dollar was too strong and was hurting us exports and jobs.",2
2024-05-21,"treasury secretary james baker convened a meeting of the finance ministers of france, germany, japan, the uk and the us at the plaza hotel in new york city. the purpose was not to fight a currency war. the purpose was to create order in currency markets out of the chaos that had prevailed since 1973. the parties reached a joint agreement that would devalue the us dollar in an orderly fashion versus the french franc, japanese yen, uk pound and the german deutsche mark. once the targeted level for the dollar was achieved, the parties would use their best efforts including market intervention as needed to maintain those levels within narrow bands. a separate meeting in paris at the louvre in 1987 agreed that the devaluation phase was over and the dollar would be maintained at the new parities. this was not currency war; it was currency peace achieved by agreement and implemented in a cooperative fashion. the louvre accord (this time including the us, the uk, france, germany, japan and canada) ushered in a period of global prosperity that lasted 20 years until the global financial crisis of 2008. trump's goal is to repeat the success of the plaza and louvre accords. trump's adviser on this is robert lighthizer, who is one of the most brilliant financial minds around and was trump's us trade representative (2017-2021).",2
2024-05-21,lighthizer was also ustr for ronald reagan from 1983-1985 so he's a veteran of prior currency wars and was in the administration around the time the plaza accord was being developed. lighthizer is the perfect individual to help trump achieve the kind of success that reagan and baker had in the 1980s. the media are trying to portray trump as reckless when he's proposing something highly beneficial for us jobs and us industry. don't be fooled by false claims of new currency wars. trump's plan could actually achieve a new era of currency stability and lasting prosperity.,2

2024-05-18,"call that a gold forecast? try this article:first, assume a gold standard. next... i have previously said that gold could reach $15,000 by 2026, says jim rickards in the daily reckoning. today, i'm updating that forecast. gold may actually exceed $27,000. i don't say that to get attention or to shock people. it's not a guess; it's the result of rigorous analysis. of course, there's no guarantee it'll happen. but this forecast is based on the best available tools and models that have proved accurate in many other contexts. here's how i reached that price level forecast. this analysis begins with a simple question: what's the implied non-deflationary price of gold under a new gold standard? no central banker in the world wants a gold standard. why would they? right now, they control the machinery of global currencies (also called fiat money). they have no interest in a form of money they can't control. it took about 60 years from 1914-1974 to drive gold out of the monetary system. no central banker wants to let it back in. still, what if they have no choice? what if confidence in command currencies collapses due to some combination of excessive money creation, competition from bitcoin, extreme levels of dollar debt, a new financial crisis, war or natural disaster? in that case, central bankers may return to gold not because they want to, but because they must in order to restore order to the global monetary system.",0
2024-05-18,"that scenario begs the question: what is the new dollar price of gold in a system in which dollars are freely exchangeable for gold at a fixed price? if the dollar price is too high, investors will sell gold for dollars and spend freely. central banks will have to increase the money supply to maintain equilibrium. that's an inflationary result. if the dollar price is too low, investors will line up to redeem dollars for gold and then hoard the gold. central banks will have to reduce the money supply to maintain equilibrium. that reduces velocity and is deflationary. something like the latter case happened in the uk in 1925 when it returned to a gold standard at an unrealistically low price. the result was that the uk entered the great depression several years ahead of other developed economies. something like the former case happened in the us in 1933, when fdr devalued the dollar against gold. citizens weren't allowed to own gold, so there was no mass redemption of gold. but other commodity prices rose sharply. that was the point of the devaluation. resulting inflation helped lift the us out of deflation and gave the economy a boost from 1933-1936 in the midst of the great depression. (the fed caused another severe recession in 1937-1938 with their customary incompetence.) the policy goal obviously is to get the price ""just right"" by maintaining the proper equilibrium between gold and dollars.",0
2024-05-18,"the us is in an ideal position to do this by selling gold from us treasury reserves, about 8,100 metric tonnes (261.5 million troy ounces), or buying gold in the open market using freshly printed fed money. the goal would be to maintain the dollar price of gold in a narrow range around the fixed price. what price is just right? this question is easy to answer, subject to a few assumptions. us m1 money supply is $17.9 trillion. i use m1 because it's a good proxy for everyday money. this is the supply that is the most liquid and money that is the easiest to turn into cash. it contains actual cash (bills and coins), bank reserves (what's actually kept in the vaults) and demand deposits (money in your checking account that can be turned into cash easily). one needs to make an assumption about the percentage of gold backing for the money supply needed to maintain confidence. i assume 40% coverage with gold. (this was the legal requirement for the fed from 1913-1946. later it was 25%, then zero today). applying the 40% ratio to the $17.9 trillion money supply means that $7.2 trillion of gold is required. applying the $7.2 trillion valuation to 261.5 million troy ounces yields a gold price of $27,533 per ounce. that's the implied non-deflationary equilibrium price of gold in a new global gold standard. of course, money supplies fluctuate; lately they've been going up sharply, especially in the us there's room for debate about whether a 40% backing ratio is too high or too low.",0
2024-05-18,"still, my assumptions are moderate based on monetary economics and history. a dollar price of gold of over $25,000 per ounce in a new gold standard is not a stretch. obviously, you get around $12,500 per ounce if you assume 20% coverage. there are many variables in play. this model is also straightforward. it relies on factors we learned about in our first week of intro to economics – supply and demand. the most significant development on the supply side is the decrease of new mining output. as the chart shows below, mine production of gold in the us has been decreasing steadily since 2017. these figures reveal a 28% decrease over seven years, at the same time gold prices were rising and miners were motivated to expand output. that's not to argue that the world has reached ""peak gold,"" (output could expand in future for a variety of reasons). still, my contacts in the mining community consistently report that gold is becoming more difficult to source and the quality of newly discovered ore is low-to-medium at best. flat output, all things equal, tends to put a floor under prices and to support higher prices based on other factors. the demand side is driven largely by central banks, etfs, hedge funds and individual purchases. traditional institutional investors are not large investors in gold. much of the demand from hedge funds is conducted in derivatives such as gold futures. derivatives generally don't involve physical delivery of gold.",0
2024-05-18,"they involve ""paper gold"" that far exceeds the actual, physical gold supply. it's this paper gold market that accounts for volatility in the gold market, not gold itself. meanwhile, central bank demand for gold has surged from less than 100 tonnes in 2010 to 1,100 tonnes in 2022, a 1,000% increase in 12 years. central bank gold demand remained strong in 2023. there's no sign of that demand slowing in 2024. overall, the picture is one of flat supply and increasing demand, mostly in the form of official purchases by central banks. finally, a bit of elementary math is helpful in understanding how the dollar price of gold can move past $25,000 per ounce in the next two years. for this purpose, we'll assume a baseline price of $2,000 per ounce (although gold has been in the $2,300 range lately with no signs of falling back to the $2,000 level). but for our purposes, we'll keep it simple. a move from $2,000 per ounce to $3,000 per ounce is a heavy lift. that's a 50% increase and could easily take a year or more. beyond that, a further increase from $3,000 to $4,000 is a 33% increase: another large rally. a further gain from $4,000 per ounce to $5,000 per ounce is a further gain of 25%. but notice the pattern. each gain is $1,000 per ounce, but the percentage increase drops from 50% to 33% to 25%. that's because the starting point is higher while the $1,000 gain is constant. each $1,000 jump represents a smaller (and easier) percentage gain than the one before.",0
2024-05-18,"this pattern continues. moving from $9,000 per ounce to $10,000 per ounce is only an 11% gain. moving from $14,000 per ounce to $15,000 per ounce is only a 7% gain. gold can move 1% in a single trading day, sometimes 2% or more. as an extreme example, a move from $99,000 per ounce to $100,000 per ounce is about a 1% move. those $1,000 pops get even easier as we approach my calculated gold price of $27,533. the lesson for you as an investor is to buy gold now. as prices continue to rally, you'll get more gold for your money at the outset and high-percentage returns as gold rallies from a lower base. toward the end of the long march past $25,000 per ounce, you'll have bigger dollar gains because you started with more gold. others will jump on the bandwagon, but you'll already have a comfortable seat.",0

2024-05-17,"these latter two features are of particular interest to the data centre segment which is deploying a broad range of solutions to better manage energy efficiency and storage capacity to reduce its carbon footprint. at the same time, cloud computing, ai, and machine learning are leading to rapidly growing demand for data storage capacity. indeed, it is estimated that between 2024 and 2025, 30 zettabytes (30 trillion gigabytes) of data will be generated, while only two zettabytes of storage capacity will be manufactured. earlier this year, seagate, a leading innovator of sustainable mass-capacity data storage solutions, launched a new hamr hdd equipped with a pioneering 'superlattice' platinum-alloy media, which significantly enhances disk performance, providing over three terabytes of storage density per platter and enabling its groundbreaking seagate 'exos' 30 terabyte hard drive. the hard drive areal density improvements achieved will enable its customers to store more data within the same footprint, economically and efficiently expanding the installed capacity of hard drive-based mass storage facilities, especially data centres. meanwhile, computer drive manufacturer and data storage company western digital is also pushing 30-terabyte territory with its new generation of drives built with technology specifically designed for data centre customers who are looking for the highest capacity storage to help them achieve the lowest possible total cost of ownership.",2
2024-05-17,western digital's high-capacity 28 terabyte and 24 terabyte hdds are built with 40% (by weight) recycled content and are around 10% more energy efficient per terabyte compared to its earlier generation products.,2
2024-05-15,"return of the kitty article:a short history of meme squeezes... just when you thought trading couldn't get any crazier, meme stocks have suddenly reappeared – along with some of the more prominent speculators from the covid bubble era, writes greg guenther in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. ""roaring kitty"" – the infamous trader who made a killing by starting the grassroots short-squeeze movement that gave birth to some of the wildest runs in stock market history – suddenly reappeared on twitter/x late sunday following a three-year hiatus to spark another run in his beloved gamestop corp. (gme). gme exploded higher in 24-hour trading on robinhood late sunday evening. the stock then promptly doubled monday morning before getting hit with a mid-morning volatility halt. when the dust finally settled, gme closed with a gain of 75% on the day. the kitty didn't post anything of substance to spark this furious rally – just a quick meme that made no mention of gme by name. but anyone who was even remotely in tune with the underbelly of the meme market knew exactly what he meant. for starters, gme shares were already on the move last week. the stock jumped 70% in just three trading days leading up to this week's explosive move. the fuse was lit – and roaring kitty pounced, inspiring an army of speculators to follow his lead. i opted for a longer-term view on this chart going back to 2020 to help put this recent rally into context.",1
2024-05-15,"you can clearly see the huge move that catapulted gme into early 2021 on the left edge of the chart. while we've seen some echo rallies since the roaring covid bubble, nothing has come close to that epic run more than three years ago. until now. is this the beginning of another outrageous meme stock rally? if so, can a sober trader actually make money on these stocks...without losing his mind? before we attempt to answer these questions, let's take a look at what happened to these stocks after the squeeze was over. months after the echo rallies faded into oblivion, the formerly unstoppable meme stocks that captured the market's imagination faded back into obscurity. and late last summer, we finally put them to bed. the army of ragtag names was two years removed from its brief era of market domination – and most of the names were nearly unrecognizable from the early days of 2021. amc entertainment holdings (amc) resided at the bottom of the pile, down a cool 99% from its 2021 highs (a couple of reverse splits kept the stock afloat and listed in august 2023). of course, amc wasn't the only garbage stock to parlay its pandemic fame into a couple more years of reverse splits and common stock offerings. gamestop (gme) and bed bath & beyond rounded out the ranks of the more popular trading names. and let's not forget the pandemic round-trippers. zoom video communications (zm), peloton interactive inc. (pton), and others experienced a brief yet powerful boom-bust cycle.",1
2024-05-15,"but there was a distinct lack of hype during the late summer doldrums last year. at the time, i was able to dig up some stray articles on how amc raised hundreds of millions of dollars issuing stock to the deluded masses of online stock gamblers. other than that, there was no media coverage at all – and this was a stock that was on the news every single day in early 2021. in the early days of the raging pandemic bull market, you couldn't escape these ridiculous meme stocks – and the throngs of speculators who believed they were somehow sticking it to the man by temporarily bullying the shares of a failing movie theater. but two short years later? crickets... the meme stock revolution hit the market with a bang, we noted. and it died with a whimper. no one was buying these stocks. no one wanted to talk about them. there was a time when these trades couldn't lose. but in late 2023, it seemed as though no one could remember what all the fuss was about in the first place. the biggest, wildest speculations of the early part of the decade were no longer delivering the insane gains everyone expected. traders cashed in what's left of their chips and went home. at the time, i assumed they wouldn't be back anytime soon. yet here we are less than a year later, watching the familiar story beginning to emerge... is it really happening all over again? it can be nearly impossible to maintain sanity and objectivity as these short squeezes unfold.",1
2024-05-15,"some investors become downright angry as these speculative bubbles develop, mainly because the extreme price action tends to reward bad behavior. imagine practicing sound trading techniques for years, only to watch some kid with a robinhood account book a six-figure gain yolo-ing out-of-the-money weeklies. it's enough to drive a trader completely nuts. unfortunately, most of these speculators won't keep the money they make on these trades. they'll plow the winnings into another long shot. and eventually, the market will even the score. one of the main mistakes i see when i venture onto the message boards is inexperienced traders putting way too much money into a single play – almost as a ""get rich or go broke trying"" strategy. but when you're dealing with these extreme stock moves, you don't have to risk a ton of capital to get involved and put up some impressive gains. why bet the farm on what amounts to a spin of the roulette wheel? i'm not sure that any ""advice"" like this is useful when it comes to meme trades. but if you are going to venture into these shark-infested waters, try not to get sucked into the hype. these are not long-term investments. don't sweat perfect entries. take what you can get with tiny positions. and pack your bags early. when that last plane takes off, you don't want to be left standing on the runway.",1

""inflation expectations"", ""cpi""...different flavors of the same general measure of what the public thinks of as ""inflation"". it will be important to keep these gold ratios (vs. inflation) in view going forward to continue to confirm the oncoming counter-cycle and as such, fundamentally positive era for gold miners, which will finally start to leverage gold's relative performance to the upside rather than the downside.",1
2024-05-12,"class identity vs. ghetto usa article:incomes are finally rising... consider the defining characteristics of a ghetto, says charles hugh smith in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. the residents can't afford to live elsewhere. everything is a rip-off because options are limited and retailers/service providers know residents have no other choice or must go to extraordinary effort to get better quality or a lower price. nothing works correctly or efficiently. things break down and aren't fixed properly. maintenance is poor to non-existent. any service requires standing in line or being on hold. local governance is corrupt and/or incompetent. residents are viewed as a reliable ""vote farm"" for the incumbents, even though whatever little they accomplish for the residents doesn't reduce the sources of immiseration. the locale is unsafe. cars are routinely broken into, there are security bars over windows and gates to entrances, everything not chained down is stolen – and even what is chained down is stolen. there are few viable businesses and numerous empty storefronts. the built environment is ugly: strip malls, used car lots, etc. there are few safe public spaces or parks that are well maintained and inviting. most of the commerce is corporate-owned outlets; the money doesn't stay in the community. public transport is minimal and constantly being degraded. they get you coming and going: whatever is available is double in cost, effort and time. very little is convenient or easy.",2
2024-05-12,"services are faraway. residents pay high rates of interest on debt. there are few sources of healthy real food. the residents are unhealthy and self-medicate with a panoply of addictions to alcohol, meds, painkillers, gambling, social media, gaming, celebrity worship, etc. nobody in authority really cares what the residents experience, as they know the residents are atomized and ground down, incapable of cooperating in an organized fashion, and therefore powerless. i submit that these defining characteristics of ghettos apply to wide swaths of american life. ghettos are not limited to urban zones; suburbs and rural locales can qualify as well. the defining zeitgeist of a ghetto is the residents are effectively held hostage by limited options and high costs: public and private-sector monopolies that provide poor quality at high prices. daily life is a grind of long waits/commutes, low-quality goods and services, shadow work (work we have to do that we're not paid for that was once done as part of the service we pay for) and unhealthy addictions to distractions and whatever offers a temporary escape from the grind. we've habituated to being corralled into the immiseration of limited options and high costs; the immiseration and sordid degradation have been normalized into ""everyday life"". we've lost track of what's been lost to erosion and decay. we sense what's been lost but feel powerless to reverse it. this is the essence of the ghetto-ization of daily life.",2
2024-05-12,"behind the facade of normalization, even high-income lifestyles have been ghetto-ized. but saying this is anathema: either be upbeat, optimistic and positive or remain silent. what's worse, the ghetto-ization or our inability to recognize it and discuss it openly? two primary trends may be reversing: wage earners – labor – may be finally starting to regain some of the share of gross domestic income (gdi) lost to capital over the past 54 years, and economic class identity that collapsed in favor of individual identity – enabling the siphoning of $149 trillion in gdi from labor to capital since 1970 – may be reviving. the two trends are intertwined: the cultural dominance of identity politics came at the expense of economic class identity, which effectively blinded us as a nation to the multi-decade transfer of wealth from wage earners to owners/managers of capital. if we're wondering how the bottom 90% have lost ground, we can start with the social-cultural blindness to the collapse of class identity which enabled the dominance of capital politically, economically and socially, as manifested in the rise of globalization and financialization, the tools used to transfer income from labor to capital. capital's increasing share of domestic income was not pre-ordained; it was the result of specific policy decisions, starting with globalization's downward pressure on domestic wages.",2
2024-05-12,"the fancy term for forcing american workers to compete with other workers around the world whose cost of living is a fraction of ours is global wage arbitrage: capital shifted jobs to low-wage regions at will to increase profits at the expense of domestic wages. this is the fundamental advantage capital has over labor: capital is globally mobile, labor is grounded in a particular place. yes, workers can move around the world, too, but there are restrictions, both legal and in cost/sacrifice, as the effort and expense required to move from one country to another are significant. capital doesn't care about a place or community; that's up to the residents. if capital shifts overseas to lower costs/increase profits, well, folks, make do with what's left. financialization amplified capital's dominance of the economy, for capital gained tremendous power as credit and leverage expanded capital's scale and reach at the expense of domestic workers and communities. it's equally important to note that the corporate dominance generated by globalization and financialization also gutted small business and the local enterprises that provide the bulk of the jobs and cohesion in communities. the rand study trends in income from 1975 to 2018 concluded that capital skimmed $50 trillion from labor from 1975-2018.",2

2024-05-12,"but in fact, the $50 trillion transfer of wealth the rand report documents has occurred entirely within the american economy, not between it and its trading partners. no, this upward redistribution of income, wealth and power wasn't inevitable; it was a choice – a direct result of the trickle-down policies we chose to implement since 1975. ""we chose to cut taxes on billionaires and to deregulate the financial industry. we chose to allow ceos to manipulate share prices through stock buybacks, and to lavishly reward themselves with the proceeds. we chose to permit giant corporations, through mergers and acquisitions, to accumulate the vast monopoly power necessary to dictate both prices charged and wages paid. we chose to erode the minimum wage and the overtime threshold and the bargaining power of labor. for four decades, we chose to elect political leaders who put the material interests of the rich and powerful above those of the american people."" that this level of incendiary outrage has seeped into the mainstream media tells us that the bill for america's gluttony of inequality is long overdue. the pendulum reached an extreme and is now starting to swing back, as evidenced by previously anti-union work forces (vw auto workers, for example) starting to vote in favor of unionization. trillion-dollar cartels/monopolies – the golden children of capital – are finally facing some pushback from their work forces and antitrust agencies.",2

2024-05-11,"copper, gold, demand and supply article:amid the green energy push, look for balance... two commodities have emerged as pivotal players as geopolitical tensions have escalated, influencing global financial markets: gold and copper, writes frank holmes at us global investors. these metals are not merely survivors of market volatility but are thriving, charting a course that i believe savvy investors would be wise to monitor. as i've said countless times before, gold has long been considered a store of value in turbulent times, and now is no exception. prices are near all-time highs, reflecting its enduring appeal during periods of uncertainty. central banks, particularly in emerging markets, are increasing their gold reserves. the first quarter of 2024 saw institutions purchase a record 290 tons of gold, according to the world gold council (wgc). this unprecedented amount highlights a strategic shift toward the metal as a reserve currency and away from the us dollar. while gold secures its position as a safe haven, copper is making headlines for different reasons. often referred to as ""dr. copper"" for its ability to predict economic trends due to its widespread industrial applications, copper has also seen a significant price increase in recent days. the industrial metal climbed to a two-year high, supported by strong global economic activity, particularly surging demand driven by energy transition technologies like electric vehicles (evs), wind and solar.",0
2024-05-11,"the global copper market is tightening. production challenges, such as stoppages and declining ore grades in major south american producers, are anticipated to limit supply growth this year, though rebound is expected in 2025. despite these challenges, the demand for copper continues to grow, fueled by its critical role in green energy solutions. the international copper association (ica) forecasts that copper demand will increase from 28.3 million metric tons in 2020 to 40.9 million metric tons by 2040, with a compound annual growth rate of 1.85%. the global manufacturing sector provides further insights. the jpmorgan global manufacturing pmi saw a slight decline to 50.3 in april from a 20-month high of 50.6 in march, but it remains above the neutral mark, indicating expansion. this resilience in manufacturing suggests a sustained demand for industrial metals, reinforcing the bullish outlook for copper. rising input costs and selling prices within the manufacturing sector point to building price pressures, likely contributing to inflation concerns. such economic indicators are critical for investors to consider as they assess the potential impacts on commodity prices and investment returns. the shift toward a low-carbon economy is not just a policy preference but a potential investment theme. bloombergnef reports that global investment in the energy transition reached a staggering $1.8 trillion in 2023, nearly doubling from 2020 levels.",0
2024-05-11,"such investments, particularly in regions like europe, the middle east and africa (emea), are expected to drive further demand for copper, given its essential role in electrification and renewable energy infrastructures. for investors, the implications of these trends are clear. gold remains a critical asset in any diversified portfolio, especially for those seeking to hedge against geopolitical risk and potential inflation. persistently strong demand from central banks further supports the investment case for the yellow metal. i always recommend a 10% weighting, with 5% in physical gold (bars, coins, jewelry), the other 5% in high-quality gold mining stocks, mutual funds and etfs. not to be outdone, copper presents a compelling growth story tied to the global economic recovery and the transition to green energy. with the expected increase in demand and current supply constraints, prices may continue to rise, presenting a valuable opportunity for investors. past performance does not guarantee future results. all opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice. some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor. by clicking the link(s) above, you will be directed to a third-party website(s). us global investors does not endorse all information supplied by this/these website(s) and is not.",0
2024-05-10,"like cocoa, love silver article:can 'poor man's gold' make you rich...? the silver spot price peaked above $29 on april 12, and it's pulled back a bit. but that's no big deal, writes byron king in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. like the rising gold price, which is over $2300 per ounce, it looks like there's more yet to come. in other words, precious metals are rapidly repricing. right away, this tells me that wall street and the city of london have lost control over the price for gold and silver. from all appearances, pricing power has shifted east to india, china and other brics nations that now dominate physical purchases. if you bought gold or silver during the past decade, you must feel pretty good right now. the price is up, and apparently heading higher. so today, let's discuss silver and a looming, much larger price jump than what we've already seen. but first, cocoa! like chocolate, it has recently melted up and exploded. could this also happen with silver? begin with the one-year cocoa chart: this chart covers june of last year to the present. it shows over a triple in price for cocoa, with the big move from $4,000 to $10,000 per tonne coming in the past two months. (by way of comparison, if this kind of price move happened with silver, we'd see the metal at over $80 per ounce; but this gets ahead of the story). is this situation with cocoa normal? do massive price moves occur routinely in the cocoa space? no, and this is kind of weird.",2
2024-05-10,"indeed, the current cocoa price has rapidly climbed to a historic high. it's unprecedented and here's a chart for the past 25 years to prove it: sure, over the years, cocoa has had ups and downs, but never an upward blowout like we see recently. this is definitely different, so what's going on? first, it's basic economics 101. there's a cocoa supply issue because of dry weather across equatorial regions of the world where people grow the crop. per the map below, these areas range from east asia to west africa, and to the caribbean and central/south america. there's no need to delve into meteorology or climate issues. just think in terms of not enough water or soil moisture to nurture the cocoa trees in key producing nations. then consider dry conditions and many uncontrolled wildfires. hence, a much smaller crop. the long and short is that the world's overall cocoa crop has fallen this past year. the problem cannot even begin to improve until next year and the next harvest season (with more rain along the way, growers hope). meanwhile on the demand side, people across the world love their chocolate. many people across the world enjoy the taste of chocolate, and it's no stretch to regard this kind of confection as a poor man's luxury, hence it enjoys a strong global market. in addition, market momentum has been a major factor pushing cocoa higher. this speculative component alone can exaggerate price moves.",2
2024-05-10,"and just as with gold, the cocoa phenomenon may be a signal that price discovery is moving away from western hands, towards the east. to sum up, the recent rise in cocoa price reflects a serious supply shortfall, rising demand, the need for new investment which will require time, and a sense of momentum as people watch the price levitate. all that in the face of a world where the very idea of price discovery is rebooting towards the east, away from traditional western markets and trading pits. silver isn't chocolate, but it has long been called ""the poor man's gold"". and silver is both an industrial and monetary metal. there's an ancient pedigree to silver as money. it's deep in the archaeological record. people write books about the history of silver as money (and on that point, i recommend the story of silver: how the white metal shaped america and the modern world, william silber, 2019). first, let's look at the silver price over the past 20 years: note the huge run-up and back down in price, 2011-13; at one point silver was well over $40 per ounce (nearly $50 in 2011). then, the metal traded in the mid-teens doldrums for a few years, 2014-2020. and after a jump in 2020 (related to covid panic buying), silver's price support was range-bound in the low $20s for the past few years.",2
2024-05-10,"now, over those same 20 years, let's also compare the continuous contract price for gold and silver: per the chart, silver and gold tracked closely through 2011-13; they both moved up and down pretty well in tandem. for the past decade, though, since 2014 silver has lagged gold, despite a strong run-up at one point in 2020 (the covid panic-buy). for our purposes, silver has traded in a range in the past couple of years, and shows legacy weakness relative to gold, with an expanding gap even now. but can this change? can silver pull off a ""slingshot"" effect and deliver strong gains? think like a cocoa trader for a moment. in terms of demand, silver is popular in ways that are sticky, if not inelastic. begin with the monetary angle despite the fact that silver is no longer used in the world's currencies; it's absent from us coinage, for example, since a law in 1965 that took silver out of circulation. but across the world, individuals, businesses, and governments (china and india come to mind) still buy silver, including old coins and definitely raw silver bullion. silver-stacking is a worldwide phenomenon. meanwhile, silver is a crucial industrial metal; a key to every imaginable kind of electronics and absolutely necessary in the fast-growing sector of solar power. all this, and silver has growing uses in fields ranging from water purification to medical products like antiseptic bandages. thus, its demand is solid and growing.",2
2024-05-10,"as for supply, statistics from the global silver institute show that global silver output from mines is basically flat, if not declining. countries like mexico, peru and china struggle just to maintain production at levels of previous years. large silver-producing companies like fresnillo, newmont, glencore and more show declining numbers. thus, it's not far-fetched to say that the world may be at ""peak silver"" just now. and yes, of course, we have exploration plays for silver out there, and more than a few strong developers. i follow the mining space and i've seen and visited many great, promising companies. but as with cocoa, these silver plays aren't turnkey operations. all will require time for new silver deposits to see the light of day; time plus immense levels of capital to build mines, mills and related infrastructure. oh, and to find and train a new workforce because much of the present labor pool is ""legacy,"" if you get my drift. and what about momentum? well, the price of silver has moved up in recent weeks, but it's not quite a rocket-ride like cocoa; not yet anyhow. then again, people tend not to see tipping points, nor to appreciate how rapidly they can occur. that is, you may awaken one morning, and the price of something (like cocoa or perhaps silver) will be on a tear, and to the casual observer it will make no sense. whatever the case, the question to ask yourself is if you are on the silver train right now, before it all begins to move very much?",2
2024-05-10,"or will you wait it out a while, until you're sure the train is rolling? or will you be the one running down the platform, trying to grab onto something before it all leaves the station? another point to consider is what has happened with price discovery in metals in general, and precious metals in particular. gold has definitely moved, by over $300 in just the past four months. the formerly routine daily sell-down in, say, new york just can't beat out the global army of bidders who want to move towards some semblance of monetary safety as the us government destroys its currency in an orgy of growing debt and interest payments. final takeaway: silver is moving, and i suspect it will do a slingshot to catch up with gold in terms of relative value, metal for metal. own physical, of course. own paper silver if you want to trade the space (eg: ishares silver trust: slv). and own silver producers like pan american silver (paas), mag silver (mag), hecla (hl), or silvercrest (silv). of course, there are many other smaller plays in the silver exploration, development and mining space, many with great fundamentals and assets, and massive upside. by every indication, the metal is moving, so you should buy a ticket and get on the train.",2
2024-05-09,"can you spell stagflation? article:i see no 'stag' or 'flation' says the fed... most economists don't believe we could have stagflation today, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. the prevailing view is that recessions are characterized by higher unemployment and reduced spending, and inflation is triggered by full employment and increased spending. therefore they cannot both happen at the same time. this prevailing view is wrong, yet it's a powerful narrative that blinds most analysts to situations where stagnation and inflation are both happening at the same time. that's stagflation, and it is emerging today. the first wing of the stagflation thesis is stagnant growth. this can take the form of an outright recession (two consecutive quarters of declining gdp) or simply slow growth at a rate below the potential growth of a strong economy. the us economy has grown in recent years, but growth has remained below historical averages. what growth we have had wasn't due to monetary policy. it's been the result of extreme fiscal policy including annual deficits that are now approaching $3 trillion per year. fiscal policy that involves direct government deficit spending does produce growth that monetary policy cannot. the question is: at what cost? basic keynesian economics holds that government spending at a time of recession or when consumer savings are too high can stimulate growth.",0
2024-05-09,"if the national debt is moderate, it's possible to get more than $1.00 of growth for $1.00 of government spending financed by borrowing. today, these conditions don't apply. the national debt-to-gdp ratio is 134%, the highest in us history. government spending is often directed at non-productive projects such as the green new scam and subsidizing illegal immigration. when debt rises faster than gdp, which it presently is, the debt-to-gdp ratio grows, and the keynesian multiplier shrinks. you are trying to borrow and spend your way out of a debt crisis, which can only end in default (unnecessary since the us can print dollars) or hyperinflation (likely). those extreme outcomes (default or hyperinflation) happen in the endgame, which can be years away. what happens in the meantime is not much better. any debt-to-gdp ratio above 90% will produce a keynesian multiplier of less than 100%. with a debt-to-gdp ratio of 134% the us can only expect more debt and weaker growth from fiscal policy. this may provide a short-term boost for biden in an election year, but it's a long-term drag on growth for the us in the end, the us is now japan. the japanese debt-to-gdp ratio is about 300%. japan has been in one long depression since 1990 punctuated by nine separate technical recessions. japan cannot ""stimulate"" its way to growth. they can only continue deficit spending to prop up nominal growth while making their debt ratio and slow-growth problems worse.",0
2024-05-09,"the us (and much of the world) is following the same path. stagnation in the form of weak growth and occasional recession is the future of the us economy despite recent strong quarters. as for inflation, there is no debate. inflation has been going up for three straight months. in fact, inflation has been in a persistent range centered around 3.3% for 10 months. inflation is back. in truth, it never went away. oil prices are one factor. the price of oil was $68.50 per barrel in. it peaked above $86 in early april and has since pulled back. but the trend has been higher. that oil price surge has not worked its way through the supply chain yet. it's resulted in some price increases, but more are in the pipeline. it'll keep inflation at current levels or higher in the months ahead. the fed is looking for signs that inflation is coming down but they're not going to get them. other factors driving inflation from the supply side include the key bridge collapse in baltimore, the closing of the red sea/suez canal shipping route and continued fallout from ukraine war sanctions. some of these supply side constraints may be deflationary in the long run but they are definitely inflationary in the short run. when you add it all up, the inflation hypothesis is strong and getting stronger. growth is also slowing, as i explained above, so both components of the stagflation thesis are intact. but the fed and their wall street toadies can't see that.",0
2024-05-09,"that's because the fed forecasting models are junk science. those models will always get the wrong result. if that's true (it is), and if wall street is following the fed (they are), then wall street will get the forecast wrong also. it's the blind leading the blind. we can start with the phillips curve. this model says that there is an inverse correlation between unemployment and inflation. if unemployment is low, one should expect inflation to be high, and vice versa. the rationale is that tight labor markets lead to wage demands that increase spending and feed inflation. the problem is there's no empirical data to support the model. in the early 1960s, the us had low unemployment and low inflation. as late as 1965, inflation was only 1.6%. in the late 1970s, the us had high unemployment and high inflation. inflation peaked at 13.5% in 1980. unemployment that year was 7.8%. unemployment peaked at 10.8% in november 1982. inflation that year was still 6.1%. in the 1930s, the us had high unemployment and low inflation (actually deflation). unemployment was estimated at about 24% in 1932. inflation that year was negative 10.3%. in 1973-1975, the us had low unemployment and high inflation. in october 1973 unemployment was only 4.6%. inflation that year was 6.2% on its way to 11.1% in 1974. in other words, the phillips curve is junk science. there are many causes of both unemployment and inflation, but a strict inverse relationship is not one of them.",0
2024-05-09,"the fed also takes the view that interest rate cuts offer ""stimulus"" and interest rate hikes offer ""monetary tightening"". that's also false. during times of severe economic distress (the great depression is a good example), interest rates drop to near zero. when economies are booming, interest rates rise because companies are competing for more funds to expand capacity and to make investments. things can go too far. high rates will eventually lead to overcapacity and recession. low rates will eventually lead to investment opportunities and a new expansion. but those turning points happen at the extremes as part of a normal business cycle. in the normal state of affairs, higher rates are associated with good times and low rates are associated with recessions or worse. the fed has this exactly backward. the fed doesn't lead the business cycle, it chases it. in short, the fed is persisting in tight monetary policy in order to fight inflation. but this inflation is caused by supply-side disruptions (oil and transportation bottlenecks) and a range of other factors the fed doesn't control. the fed is tightening into what may quickly become a recession. this is a recipe for stagflation.",0
2024-05-07,"western gold investing rebounds from record low article:new record high gold prices still spur profit-taking... gold investing among western households rebounded from a record low in april, jumping at the fastest pace in almost 4 years on the gold investor index as gold prices leapt to extend 2024's run of fresh all-time highs, writes adrian ash at bullionvault. the number of first-time investors in gold also rebounded, helping offset further profit-taking among existing holders and cutting the pace of net selling by more than two-thirds from the record outflow of march. but while this spring's rebound in western gold bullion investing is dramatic, our data show that it comes off a very low base. it also hasn't reversed the relentless selling out of gold-backed etf trust funds or stemmed the west's ongoing liquidation of gold coins and small bars. so with prices setting yet more all-time gold highs in april – and now holding firm at what were new records only a month ago – that shows just how strong gold demand is running among asian investors and savers, most especially in china's private-sector gold demand. emerging-market central banks also continue accumulating gold bullion as the wars in ukraine and gaza worsen geopolitical and financial tensions between the major powers. straw in the wind, perhaps. but are western investors finally about to join them?",0
2024-05-07,"the gold investor index tracks the number of people buying gold against the number of net sellers on bullionvault, the world-leading precious metals marketplace for private investors. now caring for a record $4.4 billion of securely vaulted and insured gold, silver, platinum and palladium in total (£3.5bn, €4.1bn, jpy699bn) for over 100,000 users from 175 countries worldwide, the west london fintech finds 9-in-10 of its client-base living in western europe or north america. bullionvault's gold index last month reversed march's drop to a new series low of 47.5, rebounding by 4.1 points – the steepest jump since gold prices first broke above $2000 per troy ounce in august 2020 – to read 51.6 on our unique data series. averaging 54.4 over the past decade, the gold investor index reads 50.0 if the number of net buyers equals the number of net sellers. it set a series record of 71.7 in september 2011, height of the global financial crisis, and peaked again at 65.9 as covid lockdowns swept the world in march 2020. led by new all-time highs in shanghai gold prices, the london bullion market set a record run of 8 new daily gold price records in a row at the start of april, with the precious metal then peaking above $2400 per troy ounce. on a month-average basis, gold priced in dollars rose to a new record of $2335, up 8.2% from march and 15.4% higher than february.",0
2024-05-07,"that was the strongest 2-month rise since february 2009, when western stock markets hit 12-year lows as central banks led by the us fed began qe and zero interest rates following the collapse of lehman brothers. so what began this new year as a stealth rally in gold has finally grabbed western investors' attention. indeed, this remarkable jump in gold prices echoes the precious metal's bull runs of the 1970s and 2000s. and while the heat has clearly come out of shanghai and comex derivatives gold betting for now, the underlying uptrend in gold remains in place. so do the factors driving it, with china experiencing its own 'lehman's moment' of investment and economic stress while tensions between the rich west and the rest-of-the-world continue to worsen. take note: the western world's leading gold investment marketplace flipped back to a positive balance of gold buyers over sellers last month. but investor selling continued to outweigh buying in april. net liquidation of 0.6% took bullionvault client holdings down to the lowest since september 2020 – peak of the covid crisis gold-price surge – at 45.2 tonnes. the rate of net selling slowed hard however, dropping by 70.9% compared to march's record heavy outflow of nearly 1.0 tonne. that let the rising price of gold take the value of bullionvault client gold holdings up by 3.5% at month-end to a second new record in a row at $3.3 billion (+4.4% to £2.6bn, +4.3% to €3.1bn, +7.8% to jpy529bn).",0

2024-05-04,"a tale of two mega-caps article:why bad earnings are good... we're smack in the middle of another exciting earnings season, writes greg guenther in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. it's once again that magical time of the quarter when investors become confused, angry (or both!) when stocks don't react as they expect after filing their quarterly updates. why are earnings so tough on armchair investors? it might have something to do with all the confusing numbers and analyst estimates floating around. or maybe it's because the financial media stirs the pot by quick-calling after-hours reactions, only to update their coverage when a stock abruptly changes direction following the conference call q&a. but the most frustrating part about earnings season is that stocks don't react appropriately once the numbers hit the wire – at least, not in the minds of most investors. more often than not, a stock will behave differently than one might logically expect, even when earnings perfectly adhere to analyst expectations. unfortunately, there's no quick fix that will make earnings season more palatable for the average investor. companies will continue to dish out fresh reports every three months, and investors and traders will simply have to do their best to navigate the uncertainty. as long as you're involved in markets, you'll have to deal with the occasional earnings shenanigans. so it's best if you learn to embrace the madness...",2
2024-05-04,"today, i'll show you that it is possible to ride the earnings wave without losing your mind. the secret to earnings zen doesn't involve scouring estimates, analyst reports, or insider transactions. you simply need to learn how to put the earnings announcements into context with the forces affecting a stock's price and trend. let's check out a couple of recent high-profile earnings reactions that have frustrated the investing masses. earlier this month we witnessed tesla inc. (tsla) rally off 52-week lows, closing higher by more than 12% after reporting an earnings miss. the very next day, investors were forced to watch meta platforms inc. (meta) crater more than 15% after beating both top and bottom-line estimates. moves like these are why so many people are distrustful of the stock market. they have no idea what to make of price action not matching up with top and bottom-line numbers parroted on the financial news. the tesla news alone unleashed more than its fair share of angry comments across social media. demand for evs is falling off a cliff! tesla's free cash flow flipped negative! profits are hitting 3-year lows! but none of these facts prevented tesla shares from rocketing off their lows as traders appeared blissfully unaware that anything could be wrong with the company's business prospects. meanwhile, meta has been a wall street darling since it bottomed in early 2023. shares were up 450% from their 2022 lows ahead of its earnings announcement last week.",2
2024-05-04,"the stock was also up 40% year-to-date ahead of earnings – the opposite action we had seen from tesla during the first quarter. while tesla's financials were a mess, meta actually posted some impressive numbers. the company beat earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, extending its fiscal comeback from the dark days of its metaverse pivot in late 2021 – early 2022. but slightly lower second-quarter expectations stuck out to investors despite the strong q1 showing. after a perfect start to the year, sellers came out in full force and sent the stock lower by double-digits to its worst showing in 18 months. to truly understand why the market reacted as it did, we have to zoom out and place the earnings into the context of the bigger price trends shaping these two popular stocks. on one hand, we have sputtering tsla shares that have already coughed up more than 40% year-to-date. tsla broke from its magnificent seven brethren in late december and spent most of the first quarter digging itself into a deep hole. most investors expected the worst. in fact, sentiment couldn't have been more bearish heading into last week's announcement. combine that with the strong downtrend and breakdown to fresh lows, and you have a recipe for a big bounce on mediocre results. tesla only needed a report that was slightly better than apocalyptic to spark a short covering rally. and that's exactly what happened! the opposite was true for meta.",2
2024-05-04,"the stock was on a historic run, posting one of the best-looking charts amongst the mega-caps extending back to the 2022 bear market lows. this strong uptrend plus the fact that meta shares extended to new all-time highs following its previous earnings beat left little room for error. anything less than a ""perfect"" earnings report would of course entice investors to take profits – which is exactly what happened. tesla just needed to prove the wheels weren't falling off their cars to attract buyers, while meta needed to dazzle analysts and investors to maintain its heck, even if this premarket drop holds, meta shares won't completely fill the earnings gap higher from early february (the stock jumped 20%-plus following its last quarterly earnings release). bottom line: earnings reactions are all about expectations – just not the expectations everyone talks about. you have to separate the financials from how the herd feels about a stock. the best way to do that is to analyze prices and trends.",2
2024-05-02,"those bank of england gold sales, 25 years after the 'end of history' article:how the brown bottom happened, why it matters today... tuesday next week will mark 25 years since the uk government said it would start selling off half the nation's gold reserves two months later, writes adrian ash in this note sent to bullionvault users in their latest weekly update email. gold's price sank on the news, dropping to new 2-decade lows. that was close to rock-bottom, as it turned out... ...and pretty much the lowest prices in history in real terms. news of the sales caused a lot of fuss back in may 1999. it caused more fuss on the 20th anniversary in may 2019... ...and it's already got more coverage again this spring ahead of the silver anniversary. so let's not waste time unpicking the whole saga here. because only 3 things matter today. first, everyone was to blame, not just the uk's late-1990s finance minister (and short-lived prime minister) gordon brown. yes, his ham-fisted fingerprints were all over the announcement. and yes, the timing and method seem willful. but investors were awol (piling into dotcom shares instead)... ...while the media kept saying what a dumb investment gold was... ...and even gold miners had been shorting the metal, borrowing and selling it to lock in the price of future production, and thus helping it fall still lower in price. as for sovereign nations, the uk was far from the first or largest gold holder to dump bullion from its reserves. and why not?",2
2024-05-02,"the fin de siecle, after all, marked the end of history...the inevitable triumph of ""western liberal democracy as the final form of human government"" to quote the zeitgeist's handbook. who needed gold when we had alan greenspan running the fed? canada, australia and argentina sure didn't. they had all slashed their state holdings by 1998. austria and the netherlands had both halved their gold reserves too, while belgium... ...like them, a founder of the single euro project due to launch at the turn of the millennium... ...had already sold 40%. france would then join the fun in 2004, selling a fifth of its bullion over the next five years. that left only the usa, germany and italy (still gold's top three hoarders today on the official data) as unwavering holders among rich western economies. most urgently, the uk announcement came just a month after the usa backed called for the international monetary fund to sell gold, and it was only 3 weeks after voters in switzerland had passed a referendum ending the franc's gold backing in law. that freed the swiss national bank to start cutting its massive holdings. which it did. but again, the big picture trend wasn't new. see how state control of gold peaked around ww2... ...back when private ownership of gold was illegal in the usa and nazi troops headed first to the central bank of the neighboring nations they flattened and invaded? then see where its decline slowed from a plunge to a slide around 2010...?",2
2024-05-02,"the global financial crisis put a stop to western central banks selling gold. it also spurred russia and most dramatically china to start hoarding... ...because washington, frankfurt, london and tokyo were actively devaluing the 'reserve' currencies pouring into moscow and beijing's central banks to pay for all the gas and gadgets russia and china churn out. no, none of the western central banks selling gold around the millennium have yet re-invested. but a growing number of nations on 'our side' have bought... ...including the czech republic, hungary, ireland, japan, poland, singapore... ...alongside many of the friendlier 'rest' ranging from brazil, india and mexico to saudi arabia and thailand. lesson for today? it's always darkest just before things go utterly black. but trends come and go. even if, in gold, things can take a few decades or more to turn around. second, the uk's decision really was awful. it gave the market 2 months' notice before starting to sell, a move that caused outrage at the time but only looks worse in hindsight. because little known back then, the bank of england... ...seeking a small yield from the nation's gold on behalf of its owner, the treasury... ...had already lent out half as much as bullion as it would divest, literally handing the market the metal it needed to front-run the sales between 1999's may announcement and the start of sales that july.",2
2024-05-02,"the bank then sold some 395 tonnes of bullion at a series of auctions ending may 2002, just less than 8% of the world's net official-sector sales across the three decades ending 2010. it achieved an average price of $275 per troy ounce, almost $13 below the london price on the eve of the announcement, and $900 below gold's average price since the sales ended. today the precious metal is trading above $2300, worth four times what it bought a quarter-century ago in real terms after uk inflation. and in nominal terms, selling all that bullion between july 1999 and march 2002 raised £15 billion less than if the uk had sold over the 33 months ending this april. but really, that's nothing. the bank of england is on track to lose £100 billion on its qe bond purchases according to the office for budget responsibility... ...selling now that interest rates have jumped (and bond prices sunk) after buying when bond yields were low (and prices were high). that's set to lock in a loss worth well over 4% of one year's gdp. unlike the 'missed profit' of gordon brown's gold sales, it's also a cost borne by taxpayers under a deal between the bank and treasury... ...a dreadful price after the public acted so selflessly, and without being asked, in "" maintaining financial stability across the united kingdom's banking system."" lesson for today? the uk's gold error 25 years ago was, in cash terms at least, a drop in the bucket compared to the western world's monetary meddling since then.",2
2024-05-02,"third and last, don't blame gold's 1999-2002 price lows entirely on western central banks selling off so much metal. oh sure, the 1999-2002 lows in the gold price soon became known as the brown bottom. but 3 decades earlier, central-bank sales had met such a rush from investors that they killed what remained of the gold standard in 1971. heavy sales in the late 1970s then coincided with gold prices surging to what remain all-time highs for us investors in real terms. lesson for today? every sale needs a buyer, but who those people are...and how their decisions go together to decide the direction of prices...are far from fixed. right now the rich west is selling gold yet again today, but less aggressively than 25 years ago and this time only from private investors, rather than from national reserves. today's net selling also contrasts with the western world's post-financial crisis outflows of gold in 2013-2015, even though...just like then...the eager buyers live mostly in china, whether as private households, investors or central-bank managers. the big difference, of course, is price. gold in 1999 had rarely been cheaper in real terms. whereas 25 years later it's now running at the most valuable since the wars of the roses on our rough-and-ready analysis of the best available data. does that mark the top? not even the most die-hard technical analyst would trust the lines on a chart using estimates for long-run inflation and gold prices made over 5 centuries later.",2

2024-04-19,"financialization: the hegemon's last gasp article:how the us economy switched from factory floor to trading floor... the united states is largely a ""financialized"" economy, writes brian maher at the daily reckoning. financialization: ""the increase in size and importance of a country's financial sector relative to its overall economy."" is financialization a sickness of corroding empires? do previous examples exist? these are the questions we tackle today. the financial industry represented 10% of the gross domestic product in 1970. by 2010 the financial system ballooned to 20% of the gross domestic product...inflated by the helium of artificially depressed interest rates. a financialized economy demands perpetually expanding credit – that is, debt – to keep the show going. that debt becomes a millstone set upon society's neck. it chokes off savings and investment in productive assets. speculation goes amok. meantime, wages wallow – and the middling classes with them. the great chasm began to open in the mid-1980s: does history reveal parallel examples? a finance man named johnston – henry johnston – stretched the historical canvas upon his work desk. he gave it a good looking-over.",2
2024-04-19,"his conclusion: ""an examination of history reveals recurrent instances of financialization that bear remarkable similarities, which invites the conclusion that perhaps the predicament in the american economy in recent decades is not unique and that the ever-rising power of wall street was in a sense preordained. ""it is in this context that it pays to revisit the work of the italian political economist and historian of global capitalism giovanni arrighi (1937-2009)...[he] explored the origins and evolution of capitalist systems dating back to the renaissance and showed how recurrent phases of financial expansion and collapse underpin broader geopolitical reconfigurations. ""occupying a central place in his theory is the notion that the cycle of rise and fall of each successive hegemon terminates in a crisis of financialization. it is this phase of financialization that facilitates the shift to the next hegemon."" the united states is the contemporary hegemon. it has constructed a global order that in theory butters the world's bread – but in reality butters its own parsnips: ""observers of the current american hegemony will recognize the transformation of the global system to suit american interests. the maintenance of an ideologically charged ""rules-based"" order – ostensibly for the benefit of everyone – fits neatly into the category of conflation of national and international interests... ""the period of ascendency is based on an expansion of trade and production.",2
2024-04-19,"but this phase eventually reaches maturity, at which point it becomes more difficult to profitably reinvest capital in further expansion. ""in other words, the economic endeavors that propelled the rising power to its perch become increasingly less profitable as competition intensifies and, in many cases, much of the real economy is lost to the periphery, where wages are lower. rising administrative expenses and the cost of maintaining an ever-expanding military also contribute to this."" only a dull, dull blade could fail to notice the american condition in these words. what is this ""signal crisis"" mr.johnston? ""what arrighi calls a 'signal crisis' [means] an economic crisis that signals the shift from accumulation by material expansion to accumulation by financial expansion. what ensues is a phase characterized by financial intermediation and speculation. ""another way to think about this is that having lost the actual basis for its economic prosperity, a nation turns to finance as the final economic field in which hegemony can be sustained. the phase of financialization is thus characterized by an exaggerated emphasis on financial markets and the finance sector."" yet the transformation from productive phase to financialized phase is temporarily gorgeous. it attains – in fact – the appearance of an economic renaissance. it is mistaken for the triumphant phoenix, rising gloriously from flames.",2
2024-04-19,"johnston: ""the corrosive nature of financialization is not immediately evident – in fact, quite the opposite. arrighi demonstrates how the turn to financialization, which is initially quite lucrative, can provide a temporary and illusory respite from the trajectory of decline, thus deferring the onset of the terminal crisis. ""for example, the incumbent hegemon at the time, great britain, was the country hardest hit by the so-called long depression of 1873-1896, a prolonged period of malaise that saw britain's industrial growth decelerate and its economic standing diminished. arrighi identifies this as the 'signal crisis' – the point in the cycle where productive vigor is lost and financialization sets in. ""[and yet] as arrighi quotes david landes' 1969 book the unbound prometheus, 'as if by magic, the wheel turned.' in the last years of the century, business suddenly improved and profits rose. 'confidence returned – not the spotty, evanescent confidence of the brief booms that had punctuated the gloom of the preceding decades, but a general euphoria such as had not prevailed since...the early 1870s.'

""but financialization also allowed the us to reflate its economic and political power in the world, particularly as the dollar was ensconced as the global reserve currency. this reprieve gave the us the illusion of prosperity of the late 1980s and '90s, when, as arrighi says 'there was this idea that the united states had come back'."" had the united states truly come back?",2

""since then, the cascade of imbalances in the financial system has only accelerated and it has only been through a combination of increasingly desperate financial legerdemain – inflating one bubble after another – and outright coercion that has allowed the us to extend its hegemony even a bit longer beyond its time."" johnston concludes with a piece co-authored by arrighi and scholar beverly silver: ""the expansion can be expected to be a temporary phenomenon that will end more or less catastrophically...but the blindness that led the ruling groups of [hegemonic states of the past] to mistake the 'autumn' for a new 'spring' of their power meant that the end came sooner and more catastrophically than it might otherwise have...a similar blindness is evident today."" a similar blindness is indeed evident today. a fellow need be blind to be blinded from the blindness. and only the blind cannot see that all of washington is blind.",2

2024-04-18,"for any country with control over its printing press, servicing debt obligations issued in its domestic currency is easy: in extremis, if it experiences a shortfall between revenues and expenditures, it can simply print more money in order to make those interest or principal repayments. but whenever countries get into difficulty (by over-borrowing) in the bond markets, it is invariably the foreign borrowings that cause the problems. take the uk. his majesty's government will never have any trouble servicing its sterling denominated debts – the government can effectively print more money, indefinitely, to pay them. but the uk government has also borrowed money in foreign currencies, such as the us dollar. the uk government cannot legally print us dollars, so it's critically important that the uk maintains foreign assets as well as purely domestic (sterling denominated) ones whereby it can service its debts. which is where the net foreign assets metric is useful. net foreign assets comprise the totality of government sector, corporate sector and household assets. a country with surplus net foreign assets is a genuine creditor country. a country with only net foreign liabilities is a debtor. chart i shows, as at 2023, where various countries sat on the spectrum of net foreign assets to gdp. the countries on the left of the chart – the likes of the uae, norway, qatar and singapore – are all objectively wealthy. they are creditor countries with meaningful surplus foreign assets.",0

(for data prior to the 18th century, the bank has used interest rates reflecting the country with the lowest interest rate reported for various types of credit. from 3,000 bc to the 6th century bc these rates come from the babylonian empire. from the 6th century bc to the 2nd century bc they come from greece. from the 2nd century bc to the 5th century ad they are drawn from the roman empire. subsequent data come from regions including the netherlands and italy.) and those rates haven't realistically been lower in 5,000 years. for anyone alive during that 1970s inflationary spike in interest rates, the interest rate game has clearly changed profoundly within their own lifetimes. an observation in passing: during the 2000-2011 commodity rally, the price of gold went up by 7 times. during the 1970s, the price of gold went up by 20 times. is today's environment comparable to that of the 1970s? in debt terms alone, it is objectively worse. although the timing is not clear, at some point interest rates, we think, must rise further – unless our central banks can keep them artificially suppressed indefinitely.",0

2024-04-18,"jamie dimon, bitcoin salesman article:what chatgpt has done to google searches for 'crypto'... artificial intelligence and bitcoin were top of mind at last week's paris blockchain week, writes frank holmes at us global investors. i had the privilege of presenting to an enthusiastic crowd. the blockchain and digital assets event, held beneath the world-famous louvre museum, attracted close to 10,000 people, an impressive 25% increase over last year, as bitcoin traded near its all-time high and ai dominated headlines. to give you an idea of just how explosive ai has been in the public consciousness, especially since the launch of chatgpt in november 2022, consider this chart. it compares google searches for ""ai"" and ""bitcoin"". post-chatgpt, people's interest in learning more about ai has gone parabolic. my presentation focused on the transformative potential of bitcoin and ai through the lens of complex adaptive systems (cas) theory, highlighting how these nascent technologies are already reshaping our world in profound ways. by exploring some of the key features of cas – including decentralization, network effects and nonlinear dynamics – i sought to show how bitcoin and ai are prime examples of complex systems whose influence on our lives will only continue to grow. ultimately, my goal was to leave attendees with a renewed sense of excitement and optimism for ai and bitcoin.",1
2024-04-18,"i genuinely believe that, if done right, these technologies can help us build a future that's more opportunistic, fair and sustainable. a good example of what i'm talking about are smart contracts. these self-executing applications, which are still in their infancy, have the potential to streamline complex transactions, increase efficiency and reduce costs. doug levin, serial entrepreneur and executive-in-residence at harvard business school, laid out the perfect use case for smart contracts in the oil industry. according to levin, these contracts could incorporate different transactions occurring automatically at different prices, based on varying market conditions. this has the power to create a fairer, more efficient and transparent marketplace for both oil buyers and sellers. the efficiency of blockchain transactions is already evident. a few years ago, everyone was astonished to learn that a $1 billion transaction between two anonymous bitcoin wallets settled in under an hour with a fee of only $700. meanwhile, moving money from a new york bank to a paris bank can still take up to a week to fully settle. looking further into the future, ryan condron, creator of the lumerin protocol, shared his thought-provoking vision of the world where everyone has their own personalized ai that knows everything about them, from childhood to, well, the very end.",1
2024-04-18,"theoretically, this ai could continue to make investment decisions and deploy capital on that person's behalf, even after they were gone, based on their preferences and the ai's deep understanding of who they were during their lifetime. with ai, paired with bitcoin, maybe you'll be able to take it with you after all. in case you missed it, elon musk made a bold yet plausible prediction last week regarding ai, saying he believes the technology will become ""smarter than the smartest human"" by next year or 2026 at the latest. i don't know who the smartest human currently living is, but if (and when) this happens, we may need to redefine what it means to be ""smart"". the tesla chief's forecast might not come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention. for months now, ai has been able to pass a number of rigorous human tests, including the uniform bar exam (ube). in february, a team of researchers reported that the most recent version of chatgpt exhibits characteristics that are ""statistically indistinguishable from a random human."" way before that, in 1997, ibm's deep blue beat world chess champion garry kasparov. another highly influential business leader, j.p.morgan ceo jamie dimon, also weighed in on ai last week.",1

2024-04-17,"a solid gold trading plan article:volatility and fomo guaranteed... gold is once again dashing to new all-time highs, writes greg guenther in addison wiggin's daily reckoning. investors are finally starting to notice what we've been talking about for months: a new bull run for precious metals is upon us. and if you pay close attention, you have the opportunity to ride the early rallies as gold, silver, and other metals take the market by storm. we've closely followed gold's breakout potential since late last year when the yellow metal finally posted its first monthly close above $2000 – and subsequently took its sweet time consolidating before extending this breakout move in early march. but most market watchers haven't paid close attention to precious metals. in fact, up until just a few weeks ago, you would've been hard-pressed to find any talking heads mentioning gold on the financial news networks. too many other distractions clogged the airwaves, from magnificent seven stock stories to the amazing parabolic rallies sprinkled throughout the popular semiconductor names. fast forward to this week and you'll notice that the semis have gone nowhere since early march – right about the same time a spark was lit under precious metals. now, we're seeing the first signs of mainstream investors and analysts buying into the new golden bull. precious metals are getting their due on the financial news as strong rallies lift gold to gains every week.",0
2024-04-17,"silver is also snapping back following months of ugly underperformance. platinum and palladium are catching bids. base metals like copper are extending their respective breakout moves. everywhere we look, we're finding bullish charts. so it's no surprise to see the big boys adjusting their year-end price targets. goldman sachs is the latest firm to grab the tail of the stampeding gold bull. it just lifted its year-end price target on gold to $2700 after spot prices hit a [then] new record high above $2370, calling the new gold bull unshakable. ""despite the market pricing progressively fewer fed cuts, stronger growth trends and record equity markets, gold has rallied 20% over the past two months,"" reads the note, via investing.com. ""the traditional fair value of gold would connect the usual catalysts – real rates, growth expectations and the dollar – to flows and the price. none of those traditional factors adequately explain the velocity and scale of the gold price move so far this year."" you might be tempted to dunk on the folks at goldman for being late to the party when it comes to the precious metals rally. but i think it's silly to take these ""target adjustments"" seriously. first of all, these ideas are for the media and the public's consumption. i do not believe it reflects the firm's investment strategy. we don't know what they're buying or selling at any given moment, but i seriously doubt they're following these targets as their primary research.",0
2024-04-17,"next, it's important to understand that this is how the game is played. any analyst target is a moving goalpost. if gold were to crater back below $2000 (which i don't think will happen) another updated target would magically appear that fits with the new trend. now, the main bone i have to pick with the fresh goldman target is how it claims that this new gold rally is unshakable- because it would not surprise me to see more shakeouts and intraday volatility as new traders and investors pile into metals and miners. we're already seeing just that. remember, gold's decade-long bear market forced just about everyone out of the metals trades until recently. gold mining stocks, for example, have been dead money for years. no one wanted to own these names when gold was going nowhere. naturally, these trades are beginning to come back to life as gold futures extend their historic breakout. as the fomo brews, we're starting to see some volatile sessions stack up in futures and precious metals stocks. again, we haven't seen this type of high-volume chasing in these stocks until recently because no one wanted to be involved in these trades. i still believe we're in the early innings of a bigger, secular metals rally. but it won't move higher in a straight line. the branches of these trees will shake – sometimes violently – as more investors pile in. a major component of any sound trading plan involves understanding the current market environment.",0
2024-04-17,"over the past several weeks, we've discussed how traders can capitalize on shorter-term moves in gold via the futures market, mining stocks, or gold funds as the environment improves throughout the sector. this also means that we have the opportunity to attempt to profit from breakout strategies as individual mining stocks heat up. knowing your desired time frame is critical when attempting to place your buys and sells as the gold trade heats up. it might seem obvious that longer-term-minded investors will be best served if they patiently buy dips, while shorter-term traders can attempt to ride momentum moves and breakouts. yet it's important to remember to have your time frame in mind and execute your plan accordingly. it's all too easy to tear up your plans and just close your eyes and buy when you see your desired stock or etf explode higher. panic buying is real – and can be dangerous! as for price targets, don't get too caught up in being right or hitting a magical level like gold $2700 by the end of december. for the record, i tossed out a $2600 target way back in mid-december 2023. it's a decent roadmap. but we'll need to hone in and adjust the route along the way. we're already witnessing some wild action in precious metals and stocks as the tensions between iran and israel evolve. don't be afraid to take a step back from the charts as additional volatility barges into the markets.",0

2024-04-17,"i still have a personal question as to whether the forces of bubble-making (now in their 3rd decade by my estimation) can hold 'er together to and through the presidential election. but we don't need to have the answer to that question. we need to manage risk and respect market signals and ta. here is the thing; gold to me is an indicator as much as it is a monetary value retainer and risk manager. i disregard views of gold as some kind of play; as a market among other markets. gold miners are a play; a play on the asset that stands outside of the keynesian debt/leverage system as the anti-bubble. when anti-bubble forces become too strong and the 'bust' end of the boom/bust cycle ensues, the gold miners should leverage the relative performance of gold to speculative upside based on positive leverage, just as they have chronically under-performed due to negative leverage during intense bubble phases. getting off the idealist views and back to the technical view, gold's weekly chart is purely bullish. the pattern of this chart targets 2450. this is a purely bullish breakout to blue sky. the monthly chart advises the target of the large cup and handle, which has been fashioned over 10 years of pain and pleasure. the max pleasure point had been the 2020 high, from which the cup made its higher right side high. after that, the smaller pattern did its thing. you see weekly and monthly rsi flirting with overbought status (as is the daily), but let's discuss this for a moment.",0
2024-04-17,"traders will watch that stuff. but investors should realize how long gold stayed overbought during the hard up phases of the previous bull market (2005-2011) and the first up phase of this bull market (2019-2020). i've shaded those instances. the thing is, an overbought market is a sign of a bullish market. i, who have held the metal since 2002, would not trade it (unlike the miners). but traders would do whatever the hell they will with gld and other bullion holders/price trackers. as we've been noting for months now, gold is bullish on all time frames, with the daily finally joining the weekly and monthly in that status back in q4, 2023. there will be breathtaking ups and gut wrenching downs. but a turn in the macro will put a relative tailwind to the ups for counter-cyclical gold in the coming years. it will require a balanced view with ongoing perspective review.",0

2024-04-12,"and while the big jump in china's private gold demand actually began this time last year, it has gone frantic in recent weeks. not that you'd know any of that from, say, duke university academic campbell harvey. speaking to cbs this week, harvey said ""institutional investors are piling in"" rather than joe public punters, who anyway find gold ""complicated to buy"" and ""costly to warehouse"". he only compounded those 2 errors by speaking for almost 5 minutes without using the word 'china' once in trying to explain what has been driving gold higher. the real story? as bullionvault noted back in march 2023, and then repeated throughout last year and into 2024, ""china's property markets have been very weak, the equity markets have been very weak, and this narrows the universe that investors big and small are likely to look for,"" explains bullion-bank hsbc analyst james steel to bloomberg. against all that, ""gold is a great safe haven."" and while the chatter in western media asking ""is this china's lehmans moment?"" about the failure of evergrande, country garden and other massive real-estate developers missed the fact that beijing wouldn't allow an uncontrolled credit collapse, china's private-sector gold buying suggests it hit something very like the west's late-2008 crash culturally if not financially.",0
2024-04-12,"you see, it's there – in china – that gold has caught real 'flight-to-safety' demand, hoovered up by people buying jewelry, coins, small bars, kilobars, gold accounts through banking apps, wealth management products, etfs and mining stocks. contrast that with the lacklustre performance of us-listed gold miners. the hui index has only just outpaced the s&p500 so far this year, lagging the price of gold itself because – well, because investors in the west haven't been buying gold. so why would they buy gold mining shares? china, on the other hand, is the no.1 gold mining, importing, central-bank buying and consumer market. it's also the world's 2nd largest economy by dollar value, the no.1 by purchasing power parity, and it accounts for 1 in every 6 people on earth. so there's no rush like a gold rush in china, and there's never yet been a gold rush like this. the visible data – due for release from the china gold association for january-to-march sometime later this month – will cover jewelry, coin and bar consumption. but ""not only is offline consumption booming,"" says chinese investment news-site stcn... ""investors are also enthusiastic about investing in gold through mobile and online banking as well as gold investment products on platforms such as ant fortune, jd.com finance, and tencent financial management connect."" and on top of that comes the shanghai futures market, throwing kerosene onto the fire. trading in gold futures and options rarely involves any gold.",0
2024-04-12,"speculators betting that the price will rise don't want metal – they want a cash profit. but the tail often wags the dog, especially if the mutt is already jumping and barking and running in circles. and with speculative trading in shanghai entering something of a frenzy in recent weeks – taking the price of physical silver landed in china to a frantic $3 premium above london prices on friday, a massive 10% incentive for new imports – speculative trading has already risen sharply in new york's comex futures and options, forcing (if not inviting) a bump in london derivatives trading as well. ""lbma numbers show a massive jump in otc option volume in march,"" says o'connell at stonex, pointing to the daily data from trading members of the london bullion market association for 'over-the-counter' contracts. options give a bullish player the right to buy at a fixed price sometime in the future, hopefully cheaper than where the actual price will have got to. but on the other side of those trades, they give a bearish player (or simply a merchant) the right to sell at certain price in future, locking in – for instance – today's new record highs no matter what happens to price from here. put another way, the jump in london bullion options' volume might signal a rush of bullish bets, or a rush to lock in prices by mining companies, or both.",0
2024-04-12,"it also very probably reflects the need for bullion banks and brokerages to cover their exposure to all the bullish bets taken out by their speculative clients as well. because for every long there must be a short, and that short will need to get or hold gold if they don't want to risk losing money should the price keep shooting higher. will it? no financial market moves in a straight line, and if you're looking at gold as a hot trend to jump onto today, then you're more likely to find that it's now at the tail-end of this particular phase. short term, china's demand may well cool as the authorities warn against speculation, and the weight of western gold selling could see prices struggle over the summer as no.2 consumer india enters its seasonally quiet period. but looking ahead, gold has consistently offered investors a way to spread risk, reducing losses when other assets drop without hurting overall returns long term. comparing gold to its historic highs priced against the stock market or in real terms after you account for inflation, today's new records are actually far below its big peaks of 2011 or 1980. and with gold and silver prices now enjoying clear blue water between today and the levels of only a few weeks ago, there are early signs of western demand picking up.",0
2024-04-12,"bullionvault, for instance, has seen april 2024 mark the strongest 12-day start to a month since march 2022, when russia's all-out invasion of ukraine drove safe-haven demand for physical gold among western investors. giant gold etf the gld has meantime seen a slowdown and small reversal in its giant outflows, as have a handful of other western-listed trust funds. straws in the wind? it most likely depends on whether the stiff breeze suddenly hitting western stock markets turns into something more stormy.",0
2024-04-11,"what yellen really told china article:are china's factories coming to america...? treasury secretary yellen recently took an airplane to china, writes brian maher in the daily reckoning. to our everlasting astonishment the aerial machine arrived intact. it was – after all – ""constructed"" by boeing. in china the american potentate read her hosts a severe lesson...and wagged a lecturing finger in their stern faces. she bellyached and moaned about chinese economic ""overcapacity."" china – in ms.yellen's telling – is overproducing and underconsuming. this condition represents a dreadful menace to the united states. thus the lady mumbled that: ""i am particularly worried about...china's enduring macroeconomic imbalances – namely its weak household consumption and business overinvestment..."" china has long had excess savings, but investment in the real estate sector and government-funded infrastructure had absorbed much of it. now we are seeing an increase in business investment in a number of ""new"" industries targeted by the prc's industrial policy. that includes electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and solar. ""china is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity...when the global market is flooded by artificially cheap chinese products, the viability of american and other foreign firms is put into question."" last week we placed within our stable mr.andrew zatlin – ""the moneyball economist"".",1
2024-04-11,"here he strips the preceding mummery to its nuts, to its bolts, to its washers and screws: ""china has built a massive manufacturing base and they continue to build out the factories. ""it's reminiscent of what japan did in the '70s and '80s, which was to rapidly industrialize and get rich quick. ""the chinese government is taking a page out of that playbook. basically, you make a lot of stuff, you sell that stuff to other people. ""janet yellen said she's particularly worried about how china is enduring macroeconomic imbalances. what does that mean? ""it means china's making a lot of money and saving it, resulting in weak household consumption. we want china to have a consumer economy...and to stop building factories that are making cheap products that are overwhelming us. ""quite frankly, it's all about jobs. if the us is flooded with cheap chinese products, us companies go out of business and we lose jobs. ""and that's the message from janet yellen to china: you're doing the same thing that japan did, and we're going to stop it."" how did the united states stop japan? in the 1980s, reagan starts pushing hard on japan. just like with china, they wanted japan to boost consumer spending and stop flooding us with their cheap goods. you know what happened? japan moved their manufacturing over to the us honda and toyota opened production lines here. by 1996 there were three factories that toyota was running building cars.",1
2024-04-11,"thus andrew expects china to pursue the japanese example. ""chinese factories will take ship at shanghai and offload at the port of los angeles...where they will board trains for the american interior."" upon arrival american laborers will empty into them. with these factories comes investment opportunity, says andrew: ""so what's the investment play here? power generation. more us factories mean a higher demand for reliable electric generation. i like infrastructure."" treasury secretary yellen refers to ""excess savings"". ""excess savings"" is a devilish condition that – happily – your editor has never endured. he can scarcely conceive its terrors. he would be reduced to purchasing all his goods and services with money in his actual possession. a credit card would be an unknown. as would monthly interest payments at 23%. thus he would shatter the central pillar of american economic life – debt-based consumption. pity the forsaken land of excess savings, unblessed by debt. its debt-to-gdp ratio is not merely zero. it is negative. contrast this hell with the debt-blessed american paradise. united states national debt runs to $34.6 trillion. united states total debt – both public and private – runs to a divine $98 trillion. and the nation's debt-to-gdp ratio scales 120%. gloria in excelsis deo! then you have those poor chinese...afflicted with the plague of excess savings. their owners fail to appreciate the infinite wonders of debt.",1
2024-04-11,"they are evidently slaves to say's law – that production must precede consumption. that is, a man must produce before he can consume. the government ms.yellen represents has long revolted against mr.say's iron law. it goes along under a sort of keynesian anti-say's law – that consumption precedes production. she herself rises in active revolt against mr.say and his universal law. she does not believe in it. what does ms.yellen believe in? ms.yellen believes in the theory that consumer spending represents 70% of the united states economy. let us now proceed to a central assault upon the consumption theory itself – the nearly universal theory that consumer consumption constitutes 70% of the united states economy. it likely constitutes far less. official calculations of the gross domestic product neglect tremendous piles of economic goings-on. these goings-on include business investment and spending on ""intermediate"" goods. these are inputs required for the production of final goods – hence they are intermediate goods. the steel in the automobile, the sugar in the candy, the wood in the furniture...these are intermediate goods...for example. yet their purchase does not classify as consumer spending – else they would be double-counted in the ledgers. explains economist mark skousen: ""gdp only measures the value of final output.",1

2024-04-09,"old-aged nato faces new world of warfare article:the nato alliance just turned 75 years old... like it or not, the world is confronting a new age of warfare, marked by escalating conflicts, writes frank holmes at us global investors. nato, the north atlantic treaty organization, commemorated its 75th anniversary at the start of april, at a time when the 32-member alliance finds itself in an increasingly precarious position. polish prime minister donald tusk's warning that europe has entered a ""pre-war era"" underscores the geopolitical challenges going forward and the need to shore up defenses. like it or not, the world is confronting a new age of warfare, marked by escalating conflicts (including those involving non-state actors like hamas and the houthis), china's growing influence and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (ai) in military applications. russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine has heightened concerns about spillover violence, raising questions about nato's long-term military support for kyiv. since the alliance's founding in 1949, the absolute number of armed conflicts globally, as well as the number of war-related deaths, has significantly declined. but in more recent years, for reasons that will be historians' job to unpack, hostilities have escalated. data provided by our world in data shows that the total number of armed conflicts across the globe was higher in 2022 than in any year going back to 1989.",0
2024-04-09,"this alarming rise in violence has led to a significant surge in defense spending among nato allies, with as many as 18 member nations expected to allocate at least 2% of their gdp to defense this year, up from just three countries in 2014, according to the group. the changing nature of warfare goes beyond conventional nation-state conflicts, with non-state actors increasingly involved in armed conflicts. the rapid development of ai and machine learning – used in autonomous weapons such as ukraine's saker scout drone – is also raising concerns about their potential use in cyber, physical and biological attacks. sipri, or the stockholm international peace research institute, reports that european states have nearly doubled their imports of major arms between 2019 and 2023, but the surge is not limited to europe. the us – which already outspends the next 10 countries combined on national defense – is closely monitoring china's military modernization efforts. beijing plans to boost its defense budget by 7.2% this year, focusing on developing advanced technologies such as hypersonic missiles and ai. for investors, rising defense spending presents a compelling opportunity. in the us, over half of the department of defense (dod) spending goes to military contractors, with the total contract spending amounting to approximately $400 billion in 2021, the most recent year of data.",0
2024-04-09,"while this sum is distributed among thousands of contractors and subcontractors throughout the country, the ""big 5"" firms – lockheed martin, boeing, rtx (formerly named raytheon), general dynamics and northrop grumman – received nearly 30% of all dod contract dollars. meanwhile, the list of us defense industry's ai suppliers is relatively diverse, with 300 contracts distributed among 249 unique vendors in a recent dataset. of those, only 36 vendors were awarded multiple contracts, and just eight won three or more contracts, including major players lockheed martin and northrop grumman, according to the center for security and emerging technology (cset). this concentration of ai contracts among a few key players suggests that these companies are well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for innovative military solutions. investing in defense stocks, like other areas, carries risks. the sector is heavily influenced by government policies, geopolitical events and public sentiment. changes in political leadership, shifts in foreign policy and fluctuations in public support for military interventions can all impact the performance of defense stocks. the industry is subject to strict regulations and oversight, which can affect companies' ability to secure contracts or export their products. despite these risks, i believe the long-term outlook for defense stocks is positive.",0
2024-04-09,"as nations worldwide increase their military spending, companies at the forefront of defense technology and innovation are likely to benefit. the us defense industry, with its strong presence in the global arms trade and its cutting-edge ai capabilities, is particularly well-positioned. nato has its detractors, but its role in maintaining stability has never been more vital. for astute investors, this presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for innovative defense technologies, particularly from major us contractors.",0

2024-04-07,"gold is the anti-bubble after all, and it appears not to be waiting for bubble markets to pop before getting a move on into the new macro picture, which will be post-bubble and counter-cyclical with, in my opinion, some severe market liquidity issues out ahead, possibly later in 2024 or early 2025. nftrh has two targets for gold based on patterns. one is within hailing distance at 2450, and the other, 3000+, is in the offing. likely after some bloody battles are fought along the way. as for the dead men walking, the major us stock indexes are still bulling along. spx, for example, a primary beneficiary of bubble policy, clings to its daily ema 20 and by the sma 50 (blue), its uptrend from october, 2023. all those gaps below? they'll be addressed one day. but for now, this dead man keeps on walking because...payrolls! because...fiscally stimulating government! because...fed tight, but not too tight! i believe there is a good chance that when the stock market takes a real bear, the precious metals may also get hammered. but the breakout on the gold chart above is more than just a positive technical signal. it represents a major positive move in the making for the anti-bubble and as such, a negative one coming for traditional bubble beneficiaries. here is the work done so far by gold vs. the s&p 500. it's been a hard move up within the intact daily chart downtrend.",1
2024-04-07,"so the trend is still negative, but this is the work (a break through the downtrending sma 200) that would need to be done to begin a narrative about a trend change (and the end of the bubble macro). gold is even stronger lately vs. global stocks (ex-us). the trend is neutral after a massive spike upward for the monetary metal in relation to global stocks. these things take time, patience and perspective. but the process is moving forward toward a coming economic bust and counter-cyclical environment. that is what gold's major breakout is signaling. we are and have been tracking the process every week in nftrh. it's time folks. it's time not be thinking as most have been trained to think over the last two bubbly decades. so says the continuum above, and many other indications beyond the scope of this article.",1

""that's why today i'm so happy to announce that i've found an exception. and that's andrew zatlin."" why is mr.zatlin ""the moneyball economist""? moneyball refers to the data-plumbing method the oakland athletics employed to construct a superior roster – despite a penny-pinched payroll. that is, the oakland athletics plowed miles deep into baseball statistics...to identify the undervalued players who produced victories...though the league at large looked past them. their batting averages may have sagged, for example. yet their on-base percentages outshined others – they took their walks. and the statistics revealed that on-base percentage is a superior metric to batting average. a man who is more frequently on base is a man who crosses home plate more often. thus his contribution to victory is superior. and so the oakland athletics plucked out this type of fellow. this zatlin adopts the moneyball model. he looks past batting average. his economic forecasting instead reduces to the data – and the data alone. that is, he looks to on-base percentage...particularly in the unemployment data.

""that's interesting, because that wasn't part of the original spec.",2
2024-04-05,"is it simply an efficient way to keep track of how many containers are going in and out? maybe. but what if this is not just to send information but to receive information? ""maybe you could inform the crane to malfunction, to stop working. could you bring down our ports if that capability was in there? these are 80% of the cranes in our ports. imagine all the equipment that's out there that's coming out of china. nobody's tracking it.

""let's take the francis scott key bridge collapse. nobody would ever weaponize a cargo ship through cyber hacking and drive it into a bridge and bring it down, crippling the port. that's crazy stuff you'd only see in a tom clancy story. right? well, how do you know? ""could that have been a cyber attack? i'm not saying it was or wasn't. it could well have been just an accident. a lot of experienced shipping experts believe it was. but there's a lot going on in the cyber arena that you never hear about in the media."" yet you will hear about it from andrew zatlin.",2

2024-04-01,"in august 2023, the department of energy (doe) added copper to its official list of critical materials, making domestic producers eligible for government subsidies under the inflation reduction act (ira). the designation underscores copper's pivotal role in securing a sustainable energy future. electric vehicles (evs), renewable power sources like solar and wind and increasing electrification across the global economy are supercharging copper's demand growth. as i've shared with you before, a single ev requires around four times as much copper as a conventional gas-powered car. all told, evs could account for nearly 60% of total copper demand by 2030, according to bloomberg intelligence. while the green revolution and electrification efforts are set to drive significant demand for copper, i also believe a compelling argument lies in the reshoring efforts of developed economies. according to crescat capital's otavio costa, the us and other g-7 nations have neglected significant infrastructure investments for over seven decades, and the emerging deglobalization trends are expected to boost these construction undertakings, with copper positioned as a potential major beneficiary. in the chart below, you can see how the copper-to-s&p 500 ratio surged in the early 2000s when china spent heavily on construction. that relationship has collapsed in the years since, but if costa's prediction is accurate, we may see copper soar again relative to the stock market.",0

2024-03-29,"china has led the charge here, consistently adding large amounts of gold to its reserves for the past 16 months straight. overall central bank buying reached record highs in 2022 and has shown no signs of slowing, helping to offset the selling pressure caused by gold-backed etfs. higher gold prices have significant implications for the luxury goods market, where the precious metal is a key input cost for jewelry and watch manufacturers. specifically, the 14% surge in gold prices since last fall appears to be crimping demand. in china, the world's largest buyer of gold jewelry, retail sales in the luxury category rose just 5% year-over-year in the first two months of 2024 despite the reopening boom, according to bloomberg intelligence. this could be worrying for luxury conglomerates like richemont and lvmh, which were counting on a strong chinese bounce-back to drive sales higher. the pressure is particularly intense for retailers like chow tai fook, the world's second-largest jewelry chain after richemont-owned cartier. in its latest quarterly report, chow tai fook said non-gold jewelry sales at its stores in mainland china slid 2% compared to last year due to ""weak sentiment,"" write bloomberg intelligence's catherine lim and trini tan. with gold trading near 30-year highs in yuan terms, the outlook for jewelry demand in china appears challenging unless prices moderate. but the picture isn't all bleak for luxury brands.",0

2024-03-27,"japan's $1.5 trillion pension fund lesson for gold investing article:risk, reward and retirement savings... now managing $1.5 trillion-worth of savings, japan's national pension fund is the largest pension fund in the world, writes adrian ash at $3 billion gold investing platform bullionvault. so you might guess that its fund managers know a thing or two about investing. and they do. two things in one word, in fact, as we'll see in a second. but they don't know much about gold investing. not yet. luckily, they would like to know more! lumping gold in with 'illiquid' alternative assets such as forestry and farmland shows just how much the gpif still has to learn. more on that below. but knowing what you don't is the first step to wisdom, or so everyone says. and now that it's seeking to understand gold, bitcoin, farmland and forestry here in 2024, what is it that japan's government pension investment fund already understands? two things in one word: diversify. first, the gpif splits its investment half-and-half between domestic and foreign assets, rather than buying only japanese stocks and bonds. second, and instead of putting the pension savings of the world's oldest population into all stocks or all bonds, it splits that money 50:50 between shares and fixed income. so far, so smart.",2
2024-03-27,"the gpif's policy of diversification has both smoothed and boosted total returns for japan's pensioners and would-be retirees compared with holding just stocks or just bonds or with investing in a mix of only japanese securities. that's the holy grail of fund management, and of investing more widely. lower volatile. bigger gains. who doesn't want that? but there's a third thing to know about diversification, a thing which the gpif now wants to understand: how to go beyond stocks and bonds. this switch is already underway, because gpif has in fact been investing in some alternatives since 2013. latest data say it now exposes 1.4% of japan's national pension savings to infrastructure, private equity and real estate – the 3 big mainstream alternatives it also names first in last week's request for information – with the aim of reaching 5.0% allocation sometime soon. but for now, and just like for the vast bulk of pension funds worldwide today, stocks and bonds dominate the risk and rewards facing your retirement savings. so might squeezing in some alternative assets help? here at bullionvault, we can't vouch for farmland or forestry, never mind bitcoin. sure, the crypto 'currency' has soared in price... ...boosting gains for anyone willing to buy and hold the hype across the past year, 5 years, decade or even longer.",2
2024-03-27,"but on the evidence to date, anyone wanting to spread risk from a portfolio holding equities should know that bitcoin shows a positive and not insignificant correlation with us stocks. put another way, and on our analysis of the past 10 years at least, it has tended to rise when stocks went up, but it also fell when stocks went down. so while adding a little crypto might have juiced your total performance, it would have worsened your losses when the stock market fell, rather than working to offset those losses and smooth your returns. that makes bitcoin an intensifier, not a diversifier. which is fine if that's what you want. but you'll struggle to explain it to your pension fund trustees. they want steady and safe, not sex and violence. so what about gold? to repeat, japan's national pension fund currently holds 4 buckets of investments. it's split pretty much exactly 25% in each of japanese bonds, japanese shares, foreign bonds and foreign shares. this spread means that, since the gpif took its current form in 2001, it has...for instance...almost tripled its annualized return compared with investing only in japanese government bonds. but holding some of those bonds has also helped it soften the gut-awful 16% loss from japanese stocks of 2018, never mind the 40% plunge of 2008.",2
2024-03-27,"adding foreign assets in a 50:50 mix also means the gpif has beaten holding only domestic japanese shares and bonds, enjoying an extra 0.5 percentage points per year since 2001 on bullionvault's analysis. that's despite the headline return from tokyo's topix share index beating global equities over the past decade (dividends included) with tokyo stocks giving compound annual growth of 12.3% rather than 8.9% from the msci all countries weighted index. how come? because of japan's beaten-down currency. thanks to negative rates and monster qe money creation from the bank of japan, the yen has sunk on the currency market, losing one-third of its value so far this century. that means foreign shares have in fact returned 13.2% for japanese investors...one whole percentage point per year ahead of the topix. adding foreign shares and bonds can prove smart, in other words, especially when the central bank in your home nation resolves to weaken your currency with zero interest rates and relentless qe money creation. but as our chart above shows, the gpif could have done better again by adding a little or more gold, thereby enjoying its next-to-zero correlation with stocks or bonds. of course, the gpif is finally coming around to the idea of buying gold precisely as the shiny yellow metal runs to new all-time highs in all currencies. not least gold priced in the japanese yen! so a contrarian investor might worry that last week's news sounds a little like a clanging bell screaming ""top!",2
2024-03-27,"top!"" for gold. but maybe the gpif isn't looking at gold as a diversifier. maybe, alongside bitcoin, it thinks gold could work to intensify its risk-return profile rather than smoothing it. because, clearly, it doesn't understand much about gold at the moment... ...calling it illiquid rather than knowing how gold is one of the most liquid assets you can trade. either way, gold has to date never featured in anyone mainstream retirement funds. physical bullion pays no interest or yield, and so it just doesn't fit with the logic of wanting to build a nice stream of income, ready to keep writing cheques to your pensionable members. cracking that market, and encouraging the trillion-dollar pension fund industry to put even a fraction of one per cent of its cash into gold, has long been a big ambition for the miners, promoters, dealers and custody providers of the gold industry. central banks, yes. they stopped selling and began buying gold as a group well over a decade ago. the result is plain to see today as gold prices set new all-time highs even with western investors and traders taking profit and cutting their holdings. add some of that pension-fund cash...plus a rebound in western investment flows more broadly...and who knows? japan's gpif request for information could make $2200 per troy ounce look cheap in hindsight. maybe.",2
2024-03-27,"money, gold, capital controls and your future article:eternal truths about the outlook for gold and mining stocks... money, in whatever form it is held, has uses, writes tim price at price value partners. traditional economists assign money three characteristics. money is a unit of account – we can price things with it; it is a medium of exchange – we can use it as a helpful replacement to the barter system, exchanging one good for another; and it is a store of value – it retains its purchasing power over time. our modern electronic money still retains the first two characteristics. but as for the third! since the establishment of the federal reserve in 1913, the us dollar, for example, has lost roughly 98% of its purchasing power. the pound sterling has fared no better. indeed every unbacked paper currency in history has ultimately failed. the dollar will be no different. it is only a question of time. gold and silver developed as money in a free market. throughout human history we have used all kinds of things as money – cattle, shells, nails, tobacco, cotton, even giant stone slabs. but gold and silver always won out over the competition. people tended over time to favour the precious metals as money because of their scarcity, durability, malleability and beauty. their use arose without coercion. gold is the money of freedom. gold is also scarce. and it is horribly expensive, in both capital and human terms, to dig out of the earth and process.",1
2024-03-27,"to produce one ounce of fine gold requires 38 man hours, 1,400 gallons of water, enough electricity to run a large house for ten days, up to 565 cubic feet of air under straining pressure, and quantities of chemicals including cyanide, acids, lead, borax and lime. but once produced, being chemically inert, gold lasts. peter l. bernstein (in his somewhat sceptical treatise 'the power of gold: the history of an obsession') points out that you can find a tooth bridge made of gold for an egyptian 4,500 years ago. its condition is good enough that you could pop it into your mouth today. and it is wonderfully malleable. if you have just an ounce of gold, you can beat it into a sheet covering one hundred square feet. or if you prefer, you could draw it into a wire 50 miles in length. clearly, gold is also a thing of beauty. ""oh, most excellent gold!"" said columbus on his first voyage to america. ""who has gold has a treasure [that] even helps souls to paradise."" but gold is heavy, dense and impractical to carry around. so using paper certificates to represent gold held safely in reserve was a logical next step. the problem arose when greedy bankers realised that they could print more certificates than they had gold in reserve to back them. the language associated with gold is invariably derogatory today. those of us who see any role for gold in the modern world are dismissed as gold bugs.",1
2024-03-27,"our response is to label those sceptics paper bugs: they have to believe that unbacked fiat money will last. history, however, is on our side. in recent monetary history 1971 amounts to year zero for gold, because that is when president nixon finally took the us dollar off the gold standard. this has led to a 50-year-plus experiment in money that remains unprecedented. when robert mundell was made a nobel laureate in economics in 1999, he pointed out that the ""absence of gold as an intrinsic part of our monetary system today makes our century, the one that has just passed, unique in several thousand years."" robert mundell could see the way the world was going. in march 1997, two years before receiving his laureate, mundell would remark, ominously, ""gold will be part of the international monetary system in the twenty-first century."" the author nathan lewis agrees. the title of his 2007 book on the subject? 'gold: the once and future money.' government debts throughout the world are simply too high – perhaps so high that it is now impossible to reconcile them. as gold investor egon von greyerz puts it: ""in 1971, nixon, by closing the gold window, started the most spectacular bonfire of the us government budget books. how wonderful, no more accountability, no more shackles and no more gold deliveries to de gaulle in france who was clever to ask for gold instead of dollars in debt settlement from the us.",1

[i] believe that society will most likely choose the apparently least painful route and thus we now face a massive structural shift away from a market-orientated economic system."" in short, napier predicts the reintroduction of capital controls, as governments simply elect to replace the central banks in the cause of stimulating inflation.",1
2024-03-27,"the reintroduction of capital controls (last seen in the uk, for example, in 1979, after which the newly elected prime minister margaret thatcher wisely and boldly abandoned them) would be a terrible metastasis of the financial crisis. russell napier again: ""there are many who see the above scenario as 'the end of the world' but of course it isn't. for the man in the street it involves another economic shock but then a 'democratic' reflation without the assistance of the discredited [central] bankers. the cycle that results will be full of growth and mainly inflation. it would reduce the debt burdens of many and feel a lot better than the deflation wrought by market forces. the inevitable massive capital misallocation that results from any government-driven investment cycle would take many years to become evident and produce negative impacts. this will not seem like the end of the world for most people. however for the stewards of private sector capital there will be little to do in such a world of mandated prices and conscripted capital."" if you're unfamiliar with precisely what 'capital controls' might be, they could plausibly include taxes, tariffs, outright legislation and restrictions on trade. capital controls could be imposed across equities, bonds and the foreign exchange markets.",1
2024-03-27,"let us consider for a moment the implications of russell's warning. ""a shift to the conscription of capital by government to force a government-led investment cycle would be very positive for gold. gold, the form of capital that is easiest to move without trace, is the most difficult form of capital for governments to conscript. those qualities will produce many buyers as the nature of the authorities' response to our deflationary bust become ever more apparent. so how do we weigh up the negative impacts for gold of a rising us dollar and rising real interest rates with the positives associated with increased government intervention in markets? we wait for the gold price to rise even as the us dollar is rising. that should provide sufficient evidence that the threat of a government-instigated reflation is more than offsetting the negatives associated with the current deflation. should that reflation succeed, then gold would likely be a major beneficiary as positive real rates of interest would turn into negative real rates that would be sustained by financial repression for perhaps a few decades."" we note, in passing, that gold is now trading at new nominal highs even in us dollar terms. we would argue that central bank monetary policy in terms of the fight against inflation has failed ever since the height of the global financial crisis. in terms of economic growth, the central banks' efforts at providing recovery have come to naught.",1
2024-03-27,"if russell napier's analysis is right, governments will soon take over, and the money printing will then resume in earnest. in such an environment, gold, being a finite and precious commodity that is also no-one's liability, is in prime position to enter a sustained bull market. we believe napier is right. why own gold? because it makes sense, within a properly diversified portfolio, to have portfolio insurance. if you inhabit a home, it makes sense to have home insurance. your investments are no different. in a world of paper assets (like certificates of deposit or corporate or government bonds), some of gold's attributes are unique. when it comes to credit and counterparty risk, gold comes with neither. gold does not rely for its value on the solvency of some third party. it is not a claim against anything. which is why gold is the perfect insurance against the failure of conventional money or the default of conventional debt. it is why gold is a more perfect form of money than any government-issued alternative. how best to describe gold? the investment consultant andreas acavalos has provided the best definition we have so far heard: ""gold is not even an investment. it is a conscious decision to refrain from investing until an honest monetary regime makes the rational calculation of relative asset prices possible."" our friend charlie morris offers a variation on this theme. he compares gold to a conventional bond.",1
2024-03-27,"he describes gold as a zero coupon, perpetual, irredeemable bond. with no credit risk. with no counterparty risk. issued by god. continuing this theme, one quotation from the world of economics fills us with more concern than any other. it comes from ludwig von mises. as someone with first-hand experience of the notorious weimar-era hyperinflation, von mises warned: ""the credit expansion boom is built on the sands of banknotes and deposits. it must collapse. there is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. the alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as a result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion, or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved."" our central bankers have made it abundantly dear that the credit expansion must and will continue. if von mises is correct, then the ultimate resolution of the crisis is also clear: ""a final and total catastrophe of the currency system."" which is why you need to own gold now. you buy fire insurance before your house is already ablaze. it is too expensive, if it is even possible, to buy it once the fire has broken out. faith in paper currencies, and in the governments that issue and consistently degrade them, doesn't follow a linear progression. avalanches don't happen in tidy stages.",1
2024-03-27,"snow continues to pile up until the system tips from being stable to unstable, whereupon one random snowflake will cause the entire snow mass to collapse. we just don't know which snowflake it will be. similarly, we don't know which act of monetary insanity will cause the financial system to implode. in summary, why gold? because it's been a store of value for thousands of years. and it represents a form of money with no credit or counterparty risk. why gold now? because the risk of a global monetary fiasco rises by the day. depending on the extent of one's savings and one's risk appetite, there are three ways of getting exposure to the investment merits (and risks) of gold: physical metal. this is the purest form of gold ownership, but it involves counterparty risk if held with a third-party custodian. the largest and best capitalised gold mining companies. this offers the potential of higher returns than from the gold price alone given the operational leverage of many gold miners, but it also involves equity market risk. depending on the size of your wallet and your attitude to risk, there are the junior miners too. in a gold bull market, the returns from owning smaller-cap miners are likely to be higher, but they'll come with additional risk of corporate failure. each of the above can also be held in the form of low-cost etfs (exchange traded funds) or actively managed funds [albeit without any direct ownership, ed.].",1
2024-03-27,"we favour some diversification into mining company stocks because of what has happened in the history of gold. for example, executive order #6102, signed by president franklin d.roosevelt on 5 april 1933, made the private ownership of gold illegal in the united states, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or up to ten years in prison, or both. clearly we no longer operate within a gold standard but we'd rather not take any chances – hence the merit of ownership of interests in gold mining concerns as well as the physical asset itself. if you elect to own gold, you probably want to give some thought to where it's custodied. it makes no sense to own gold within the onshore banking or financial system – where national governments might ultimately start to display distinctly unconventional attitudes to the sanctity of private investors' property. it does make sense to hold gold in safe custody offshore. our preferred foreign jurisdictions (from the perspective of a uk-based investor), in no particular order, would include switzerland, singapore, australia and canada. if you elect to own gold, ensure that you own allocated gold – that is, gold owned outright by you and held in your name. you don't want exposure to unallocated gold – which is the property of the custodian. that's like being a depositor/unsecured creditor all over again. there are far too many paper claims on gold and simply not enough of the physical asset to support them.",1

(and it probably already has.) to sum up the argument for gold, we'd like to share some words by an asset manager and friend, tony deden, who may have thought about the parlous state of our financial system and its implications more profoundly than anyone else we know: ""substance is something that is real. it does not necessarily have to be tangible, but that would be preferable. whether it is in gold – a form of money – or honest entrepreneurship, substance is rooted in economic reality. and so, understanding substance, whether it is in money or in entrepreneurial and wealth-creating activity, is the most important practical skill we must acquire. ""indeed, the price of gold in money may increase. it may also decrease. when do you sell it?",1

2024-03-26,"this chart tells a story of something that was in place for decades (going back to the 1980s, not shown on this chart) that is no longer in place. 30 year treasury yield continuum, which implies a new macro and a new era for gold stocks in my opinion, markets operating as if all is as it has been (hello us headline indexes, bad breadth and all) are dead men walking. the continuum is a pictorial view of the funding mechanism of the bubble. well, the mechanism is severely altered, if not broken. i began this post with the intention to keep it very simple and have already veered from that course. so let's get it back on course. let's take a look at gold mining stocks through the prism of their relationship to gold and gold's relationship to other markets. this daily chart shows that in 2023 gold stocks (hui) had rightly traveled both positively and negatively in line with their best fundamental gauges. those are gold's relationships with commodities and inflation. when gold declined in relation to inflation signalers like 'inflation expectations' gauge rinf and commodity index gnx, gold stocks declined right along with them. as it became apparent that inflation was weakening and gold rose vs. those items, gold stocks rallied. then came the disconnect and positive divergence (for gold stocks) by gold's relationship to the inflation signalers (rinf, gnx, etc).",2
2024-03-26,"i believe this happened because the herd finally bought the disinflationary 'goldilocks' (soft landing or even no landing) story as euphoria set in and tech/growth stocks gained momentum. the hard decline by hui from q4 2023 to q1 2024 aped the decline in gold vs. the stock market (spx). of course, the hui/gold ratio tagged right along. ""gold stocks suck!"" demands the herd. and the herd is right; for now. the nftrh view has for over a year been for disinflationary goldilocks to be followed by an uncomfortable decline in inflation. in other words, a deflation scare, quite possibly as a precursor to the next terrible inflation phase out in 2025 or thereafter. with indexes like spx, ndx and sox still orbiting in blue sky the gold/spx ratio is in the tank and right along with it have been gold stocks (and their ratio to gold). while gold/gnx and gold/rinf have represented a positive divergence for gold stocks, gold/spx has been quite the opposite. hence, we await the end of the currently at high risk bull market in stocks. here is the same chart, expanded to a long-term view showing the 2001-2003 period when gold/spx rose, gold/gnx rose and by extension, hui/gold and nominal hui rose. there was no such thing as an 'inflation expectations' etf back then, but using tip/tlt or tip/ief, you'd get the same result; gold rising in relation to those ratios.",2

""standing back and looking at the totality of monetary policy in this cycle, we can see that – far from conditions tightening – we have instead seen one of the biggest loosenings of them in decades."" is it evidence you seek? then it is evidence you shall have: the steeply ascending red represents the federal reserve's target rate. the largely descending blue represents financial conditions as bloomberg gauges them. the federal reserve has undertaken four rate elevation cycles within the past 30 years. none has yielded a greater financial loosening than the present cycle. how do you explain it?",0

2024-03-20,"it happened during the global financial crisis when the original distress in august 2007 that seemed contained was followed by the failures of bear stearns, fannie mae, freddie mac and lehman bros. from march to september 2008. the average duration of these financial crises is about 20 months. this new crisis began 12 months ago. it could have eight more months to run, if not longer. on the other hand, this crisis could reach the acute stage faster. that's because of technology that makes a bank run move at the speed of light. with an iphone you can initiate a $1 billion wire transfer from a failing bank while you're waiting in line at mcdonald's. no need to line up around the block in the rain waiting your turn. in other words, the second stage of the crisis could erupt in even more dramatic fashion sooner than later. this slow-motion crisis can become a real-time crisis very quickly. in addition, the regulatory response is faster because they've seen this movie before. that begs the question of whether regulators are out of bullets because they've already guaranteed almost everything so they don't have more rabbits to pull out of the hat. this could be the crisis where the panic moves from the banks to the dollar itself. if savers lose confidence in the fed (we're almost there) not only will the banks collapse, but the dollar will collapse also. at that point, the only solution is gold bullion.",2
2024-03-20,"it's also important to distinguish between individual bank failures and a systemic banking crisis. when individual banks fail, the depositors and creditors are usually protected but stockholders can get wiped out. in a systemic banking crisis, the contagion goes from bank to bank quickly, and the entire system has to be rescued with some combination of blanket deposit guarantees and unlimited qe. in the worst case, you either have to shut the banks (which fdr did in 1933) or nationalize them which some countries have done from time to time. either a single bank failure or a systemic crisis could happen at any moment. the actual trigger is a bit mysterious and mostly psychological because the fundamental problems have been there all along. well, it seems that the quiet period is over and we are entering stage ii of the banking meltdown. new york community bancorp (nycb) had taken huge losses of over $2 billion in february on its commercial real estate (cre) portfolio. it had been teetering on the brink ever since. on march 6, it was bailed out with $1 billion of new capital raised by former treasury secretary steven mnuchin and ken griffin's citadel hedge fund. nycb may have been bailed out, but it's the canary in the coal mine. its failure means billions more in cre losses are buried on bank books all over the country. the bottom line is stage ii of the crisis is here, and the effects will be devastating to financial institutions and the stock market as a whole.",2

2024-03-18,"the affordability crisis can be attributed to a multitude of factors, chief among them being the persistent rise in mortgage rates. despite recent declines from their october peak, rates remain significantly higher than they were in 2022, resulting in a typical homebuyer's monthly payment being approximately $250 more than a year ago, redfin estimates. moreover, elevated mortgage rates have inadvertently exacerbated the supply crunch, as many homeowners are opting to stay put rather than risk losing their ultra-low rates. this reluctance to sell has bolstered prices as buyers now compete for a limited pool of available properties. while some relief may be on the horizon, the path ahead remains uncertain. the federal reserve's recent decision to hold off on rate changes, coupled with the potential for future cuts, has introduced a degree of volatility into the market. compounding the challenge is the unexpected surge in wholesale prices in the us, as evidenced by the producer price index (ppi). prices for manufacturers rose 0.6% month-over-month in february, ahead of expectations, while the consumer price index (cpi) also ticked up from january. this poses fresh obstacles for economic and monetary policy, potentially delaying anticipated rate cuts as the central bank prioritizes curbing inflation over stimulating growth.",0

2024-03-08,"net of bearish bets, the bullish position among 'managed money' traders (on data from us regulators the cftc) was 25% smaller than its 2023 average and only two-thirds its average size (65%) of the past 10 years. we won't know this week's long/short data until this evening. but on average since last friday, data from the cme derivatives exchange says that the daily trading volume in comex gold futures has jumped 68.0% from its daily average across the previous 3 months. in options contracts (which are more leveraged, more speculative, more risky) it's leapt by 102.2%, setting the highest daily average since mid-october (when gold prices rebounded from sudden multi-month lows) and coming within 5% of its highest since the all-time records of march 2020 (when the covid crisis spurred record-heavy western gold investment). this week's jump in the speed and size of comex trading suggests that one or more hedge funds or other hot-money speculators – wanting to bet on a recovery in us fed rate-cut expectations – decided that gold options offered the biggest delta. so far, that looks a smart bet, and it contrasts sharply with continued profit-taking in vaulted bullion investment as well as the outflows from us and european etfs backed by gold. ( what about 'short-covering' driving the price jump, as some analysts suggest? speculators as a group weren't wildly bullish gold on last week's cftc data, but they were net long as a group.",0
2024-03-08,"more plainly, gross short positions were not excessive by any measure. the managed money category on tues 27th feb's figures held total short positions in futures and options 10% below the 2023 average and 14% smaller than the 10-year average.) physical gold outside the west underpinning the surge in gold investing prices, note that the physical-market benchmarks in both shanghai (entry-point into china, gold's no.1 consumer market) and in london (heart of the world's gold bullion storage and trading network) have risen rather than fallen as options trading has jumped. indeed, the spot price has repeatedly risen around london's 3pm auction (including into thursday afternoon's fresh record), suggesting stronger demand to invest than supply at the opening price and thereby needing a higher price to curb demand and boost selling to find the final clearing level. yes, some of that demand at the benchmark auctions will have come from bullion banks and brokerages needing gold to match their exposure to client derivatives positions. but crucially, physical demand in india and most especially in gold's key consumer market of china continues to run strong, and central-bank demand for gold also remains historically hot, again led by emerging market nations in 'the rest' rather than 'the west'.",0
2024-03-08,"that's clearly been supporting and helping drive up the gold price, breaking the more typical pattern of asian households and central banks acting as price takers, buying the dips and turning cautious on strong gains. china's latest official purchases (another 12 tonnes in february, the 16th consecutive month of reported accumulation) confirm its position as the world's no.1 central-bank gold buyer. but many other sovereign nations are also favouring the precious metal as a safe haven, as a way to invest against the worsening geopolitical outlook. short-term gold price outlook looking ahead, the speed of gold's move and the size of the gains made by options traders this week could see speculators join physical investors in taking profit – and those physical bullion owners have only increased the pace of their profit taking as the price has jumped higher. that will, of course, add more supply to the global bullion market, potentially weighing on prices. what's more, and because gold pays no income, these new all-time price highs could also be vulnerable to dropping back if central banks – led by the us fed – now commit to holding interest rates higher for longer to try keeping a lid on inflation. that would cool the speculative heat in comex futures and options which has clearly lit this sudden fire beneath gold prices this week.",0
2024-03-08,"but a pull-back isn't guaranteed for the gold price, not given the dreadful mood music from geopolitics, and any dip could prove good opportunity to buy into the precious metal's underlying strength. indeed, with the boom in us tech stocks increasingly described as a bubble while moscow and nato talk openly about the threat of direct conflict, western portfolios have started to look overweight risk and underweight insurance. so while private-investor gold demand in europe and north america will likely remain weak until cash interest rates start to fall, strategic allocations to gold among portfolio managers may start to rebound before the fed, the ecb and the bank of england make their first cut. how unusual is this gold-price surge? gold on thursday set its 4th new london pm benchmark record in a row at $2153.45. based on that figure, and in us dollar terms, gold has now risen by: week-on-week 5.2% 1-month change 5.5% 13-week change 5.8% 1 year change 17.9% unusual? short term, yes. gold's move has been dramatic, reflecting the sudden jump in speculative bullishness. week-to-week, that rise of 5.2% comes in the top 3% of all weekly moves since 1969 (including price drops). but on average, weekly gains of this size (between 5.0% and 5.5% in us dollar terms) have been followed by 1-month gains of 2.4% mean and 1.2% median across the past 55 years; looking at just the past 2 decades, such rises then saw 1-month gains of 0.5% mean and 1.3% median in the dollar gold price.",0

2024-03-08,"april 1969, for instance, saw bullion prices rise on heavy private-investment demand for gold amid growing rumours and speculation that the usa would abandon its $35/oz peg following the collapse of the us-european central banks' 'london gold pool' the previous march. (it had sold huge quantities of national bullion reserves into the private market to try putting a lid on the price.) the us would finally abandon the dollar's gold peg with the 'nixon shock' of august 1971. but of the 15 distinct periods for 5-day record highs in the gold price (spring 1969, new year and spring 1972, spring + summer 1973, new year 1974, autumn 1978, autumn 1979, new year + spring 2008, autumn 2009, autumn 2010, spring + summer 2011, summer 2020) only 3 came close to what proved a longer-term peak. october 1979 was followed by gold setting what became a 2-decade peak at $850 on 21 jan 1980; august 2011 saw gold peak at $1895 on 6 sept; late-july 2020 saw gold peak on 6 august at $2067. what about longer runs of new record gold prices? may 1973 saw gold set a 6-day run of record highs as oil prices (and inflation) surged amid a threat that saudi arabia would impose an embargo on exports to the us because of its support for israel. (the embargo then came in october.) july 2020 also saw a 6-day run as social unrest grew against pandemic lockdowns and governments everywhere unleashed yet more record fiscal and monetary stimulus amid the first-wave covid catastrophe.",0
2024-03-08,"gold's record 7-day run of new all-time highs this came in 2008, running from jan 7th ($859) to 15th ($913) as the global financial crisis accelerated. global stock markets were falling hard, and the us fed promised to keep cutting interest rates as panic gripped banking shares and bonds. the crisis grew until bear stearns was rescued by the us authorities (and got taken over by j.p.morgan) on 14th march. that same day, gold made its first all-time high above $1000. it wouldn't set its final gfc high for another 3 years. what next for the price of gold? we don't make price forecasts at bullionvault. as a trading exchange, we earn a (very small) commission whether customers buy or sell, so it wouldn't be right or fair to our users. but as a group, and in us dollar terms, private investors using bullionvault's simple, secure and low-cost marketplace at the end of 2023 gave a 2024 gold price forecast for bullion to finish this year at $2342 per troy ounce. that would mark a rise of 12.7% from the final london 3pm benchmark of last year...which might have sounded overly bullish at new year. indeed, that year-end prediction from users of bullionvault was higher than the highest high predicted across 2024 by all but one of the 25 professional analysts entering this year's lbma forecast survey. chantelle schieven, head of research, capitalight research, predicted an annual average of $2170 with a peak of $2405 and a low of $1935.",0
2024-03-08,"but the average annual forecast by all those 25 analysts as a group was just $2059 per troy ounce, only $20 above what gold has now averaged so far in 2024. and a year-end rise of 12.7% – as forecast by private individual choosing to invest in gold using bullionvault – wouldn't be unusual. gold in dollars has risen by more than that in 30 of the past 55 years, including 5 times in the past decade. bottom line for gold prices today? despite making a run of new all-time highs this week, gold is very far from a crowded trade, never mind a bubble. while the past few days look dramatic, and while the sudden jump in hot-money betting on gold derivatives will naturally burn itself out, the underlying uptrend remains steady, almost boring in fact compared with bitcoin tripling over the past 12 months or against the big gains in equities led by us tech stocks. that might explain why western investors continue to stay shy of gold coins, small bullion bars and gold etfs like the gld and iau, taking profit as a group overall rather than buying the precious metal right now. but long-term bull markets aren't built by repeatedly grabbing the headlines, and if you view gold as a form of investment insurance – which is how the vast majority of private and professional investors holding gold see it – the best time to buy is before it matters, when other financial markets are doing well and there isn't a rush into the 'safe haven' metal.",0
2024-03-08,"and what this week's price pop driven by options betting really shows is how, when western investors do return to buying gold – whether on cuts to cash interest rates, deeper economic and banking stress, or a worsening of geopolitical tensions and conflict – the precious metal's long-term and ongoing bull market is very likely to keep running higher.",0

2024-02-22,"designed by '70s marketing firm hipgnosis, the gatefold sleeve for presence featured 'the object' in a series of photos... ""...pictures torn out of national geographic magazines from the 1950s"" in fact, according to the artist aubrey powell. ""we just painted in black that exact shaped object with ordinary people in ordinary situations. in other words: this was something you needed to live. it was food. it was a symbol of energy, of power. which is what led zeppelin were."" was this the model for the ecb tower? is that what it says about the european central bank? that it's vital, essential, omnipresent, all powerful? neither zeppelin nor hipgnosis get a mention in any of the pr, news or reviews i can find around the ecb tower. nor do most of the journalists and fans writing about presence on the internet mention ""the other thing about the black thing"" either... ...the fact that ""it's clearly evil"" as one comment puts it. occult most certainly (a big theme for guitar hero jimmy page), it's very possibly alien, like the obelisk in 2001: a space odyssey. or perhaps it's simply surreal. either way, the object's presence among those ""ordinary people"" in ""ordinary situations"" has always felt threatening going on terrifying to me. savers in the eurozone might agree.",0
2024-02-22,"the ecb has repeatedly paid a lower rate of interest than the pace of inflation since the euro came into being on 1 january 1999. (indeed, it even paid a lower rate of interest than 0% for 8 years starting in 2014!) that has turned €10,000 into less than €7,500 in real purchasing terms, with most of the harm done since the tower was topped out a decade ago. how's that for black magick? it's now almost 50 years since the object appeared on the cover of presence, 20 years since the ecb chose the same shape for its towering lair, and 10 years since the glass-clad ""thing"" was completed. yet the tower's blank stare remains ""a modern building for a modern central bank"" to quote the ecb's own website. again, that makes the tower very different from most of its counterparts among the rest of the world's reserve currencies and also-rans. because the ecb is almost alone in not trying to look like something from ancient greece, renaissance italy, or aristocrat europe. take the marriner s.eccles building in washington dc, for instance. built to the design of french 'beaux-arts' architect paul philippe cret almost a century ago, it houses the federal reserve board inside the white marble and sturdy columns of a classical temple.",0
2024-02-22,"a very 1930s' temple to be sure... ...and much more like a massive and threatening art deco cinema, shopping mall or even government bullion vault than the 18th century country pile designed at the same time by herbert baker for the bank of england in the city of london. that was finished in 1939, two years later than the eccles building (and just in time for the luftwaffe to try flattening it) with fluted columns and a giant portico. but cret's ""stripped classical"" style for the us fed still centres on a huge door, reached by a wide flight of steps, which is almost lost in a massive frontage that bellows 'ancient temple! greek gods at work!' so too, weirdly, does the bank of japan in tokyo. designed and built in the 1890s, the home of the yen was conceived by architect tatsuno kingo on trips to belgium, the usa and england, where he regularly went to survey the bank of england's genuinely 18th century manifestation, designed by john soanes and finished after 40 years' work in 1833. the boj thus mimicked its western peers like emperor hirohito wearing a morning suit and starched collar.",0

""the colonnade on the ground floor of the courtyard is in the doric style, while the coupled columns extending from the second to third floors of the façade, courtyard, and west side of the building are corinthian."" outside today's rich-world economies, a similar story. the reserve bank of india in mumbai was built in 1980, yet it channels the us fed's 1930s temple in washington more than anything else, with a couple of classical columns thrown in for good measure either side of the huge entrance. china's central bank of course tends more towards ""communist chic"". but even here (and with zero history available online that i can find) the pboc's curved headquarters loom so large and monumental that the roundtable discussions inside are clearly open only to the very highest officials, the unelected elite. more classical columns adorn the front of the central bank of russia's hq in moscow, but heavy dollops of wedding-cake trim and light yellow paint make it a romanov palace above all else. and why not? the next best style after ancient greek temples for running a country's money is ""aristocrat bling"" as the bank of england has shown for almost 3 centuries... ...never mind the banque de france in paris... ...both ruling high above the mob, if not quite so high and powerful as gods and goddesses.",0

""at this stage, the board hasn't ruled out a further increase in interest rates, but neither has it ruled it in,"" says reserve bank of australia chief michelle bullock (like her new zealand counterparts, stuck in a very 'modern' office block), leaving no-one any the wiser. ""we don't need inflation to come back to target before we cut interest rates, i must be very clear on that,"" says uk bank of england boss andrew bailey, clarifying nothing instead of trying to address the 3-way split among his policy team on raising, holding or cutting rates at their february meeting.",0

2024-02-19,"dxy and gsr: 2 horsemen of macro apocalypse article:dollar index and the gold/silver ratio... the two horsemen of the macro apocalypse are the us dollar and the gold/silver ratio, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. when the global market counterparty – the us dollar (dxy) – and the gold/silver ratio (monetary, counter-cyclical vs. a less monetary, more cyclical/industrial precious metal) rise moderately, then the indication can be goldilocks/disinflation, like the backdrop we've generally had for a year now. but when they rise strongly or impulsively, the indication is to get the hell out of the asset pool, because its liquidity will be drained. when they drop together, the indication is for a macro party that can include and eventually favor commodities, inflation trades and a generally wider scope of bullish assets than the goldilocks tech/growth theme. this would include the precious metals, given that the elusive longer-term bullish backdrop (post-bubble contraction) is not yet in play. (with silver leading gold, the precious metals would likely rally along with the inflation trades as they so often do. the best fundamental backdrop would come after the big macro bubble pops, which is not yet the case.) the us dollar index is lurking below the pivot point of the december high, which would indicate a shift to an intermediate uptrend and test of the 105.90 area. it already poked above and now flags at a decision point.",0

2024-02-15,"gold? get diversified! article:inflation isn't backing off as fed expected... despite the wall street happy talk about the federal reserve winning the battle against inflation, that battle has not been won, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. headline cpi (the kind americans actually pay, not constructs like ""core"" and ""super-core"") was 3.1% in january, where it was in november and compared with 3.0% last june. in other words, inflation is not gone and may even be on the rise with higher oil prices lately due to geopolitical concerns. the fed will not raise rates, but they will not be quick to cut them given continued inflation. inflation has a way of sneaking up on investors in small increments and can do a lot of damage before investors see it for what it is. sure, 3.1% inflation is a lot better than 9% inflation. but january's 3.4% inflation rate cuts the value of a dollar in half in 21 years and half again in another 21 years. that's a 75% dollar devaluation in just 42 years or the course of a typical career from age 23 to age 65. that's one of the main reasons i recommend gold. gold is priced in dollars. inflation means the dollar is worth less in terms of purchasing power. that means it takes more dollars to buy gold, so the dollar price of gold goes up. what you may lose in the rest of your portfolio in terms of dollar purchasing power is made up in part or all from the profits you make on the higher dollar price of gold.",0
2024-02-15,"owning gold will protect you from the ravages of inflation. you'll have your inflation protection in place 24/7 and won't be caught off-guard. geopolitical conflicts and political turmoil often result in unforeseen consequences. these consequences can include supply chain disruptions, economic sanctions, asset seizures and freezes, bond defaults, bank failures and inflation. oil prices can spike if key waterways are closed, or a vessel is sunk. economic sanctions and financial warfare can cause recession or a banking crisis almost overnight. assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and alternative investments can be adversely affected by such changes without warning. gold tends to be insulated from such shocks because there is no issuer, no creditor and no country involved. it's just gold. that means you can hold it safely and wait out the turmoil without adverse effects. gold prices do not correlate closely to stock prices. gold and stocks are driven by separate factors. that makes gold a good diversification asset for portfolios that are heavily in stocks. when a portfolio is highly diversified, it can produce higher expected returns without adding risk. the difficult part is finding asset classes that really are diversified. buying 50 different stocks is not diversification since you only have one asset class – stocks – and the behavior of various shares will be highly correlated in times of stress.",0
2024-02-15,"gold is genuinely diversified from stocks and will improve portfolio returns. gold prices have been trending higher lately with some volatility along the way. these trends toward higher prices have been driven by lower interest rates; continued inflation; geopolitical concerns about the middle east; and continued buying by central banks, especially russia and china. all those trends will continue. one of the principal drivers of the gold price rally is the steep decline in interest rates in recent months. the interest rate (expressed as a yield-to-maturity) on the 10-year us treasury note plunged from around 5.0% to 4.0% in a matter of weeks at the end of 2023. don't mistake a 1.0% move for something small. that's an earthquake in bond markets, especially in such a short period of time (47 days). a 1.0% move in that short a period of time has only happened in the treasury market six times in the past 30 years. rates have backed up slightly in the past month, but that's to be expected. nothing moves in a straight line. the decline in rates will resume in the months ahead as the us economy moves into disinflation and recession. that will give a boost to the dollar price of gold since notes and gold compete for investor allocations. lower interest rates generally make gold relatively more attractive since gold has no yield. meanwhile, russia and china and other central banks have been adding to their gold reserves consistently since 2008.",0
2024-02-15,"total gold reserves have increased from about 600 metric tonnes to 3,000 tonnes in russia, and over 2,000 tonnes in china (although there is good reason to believe that china's gold reserves are much higher, perhaps double the official figures or more). that increase in gold holdings will continue and probably accelerate as the us threatens to seize russian reserves in the form of treasury securities and as progress is made on the new brics gold-linked currency. every investor should have an allocation to gold in her portfolio. it's an excellent diversification and can be a powerful asset to have in the face of natural disaster, infrastructure collapse or social unrest. i recommend a 10% allocation of investable assets to gold. in calculating investable assets, you should exclude home equity and the value of any private business. don't gamble with your house and livelihood. whatever is left (stocks, bonds, real estate, alternatives) are your investible assets. allocate 10% of that amount to gold. that allocation is high enough that you'll make significant profits (and protect against losses in the rest of your portfolio) if gold soars, but small enough that your overall portfolio won't be hurt badly if gold goes down. i believe a 10% allocation is the sweet spot for both profits and downside protection. the bottom line is gold is like an anchor for the rest of a diversified portfolio. gold is physical so it is not easily frozen by government fiat.",0

""post-bubble"" will be a different story. but you can't change the macro because of 'want'. it will change when it is good and ready. in the year 2001 sir alan greenspan was forced to abandon his stately ""maestro"" image in favor of a more desperate, even panicky version of himself. that desperation was put into effect by the various inflationary means used to birth and blow the credit bubble, which launched the real estate/mortgage bubble and eventually, the great stock market bull that persists to this day. this is ancient history (2003-2008), but it was an important time when we as market participants were taken down the rabbit hole, whether we liked it or not.",0

2024-02-13,"easy money, rotten economy article:how low rates and qe distort wealth and incomes far into the future... we have yet to reach a full reckoning of the consequences of the era of easy money, but it's abundantly clear that it ruined us, writes charles hugh smith on his oftwominds blog in this story reposted by addison wiggin's daily reckoning. the damage was incremental at first, but the perverse incentives and distortions of easy money – zero interest rate policy (zirp), credit available without limits to those who are more equal than others – accelerated the institutionalization of these toxic dynamics throughout the economy and society. fifteen long years later, the damage cannot be undone because the entire status quo is now dependent on the easy-money bubble for its survival. should the bubbles inflated by easy money pop, the financial system and the economy will collapse into a putrid heap, undone by the perversions and distortions of endless easy money. easy money created destructive, mutually reinforcing distortions on multiple fronts. let's examine the primary ways easy money led to ruin. the near-zero rate credit was distributed asymmetrically; only the wealthiest few had access to the open spigot of ""free money."" the rest of us saw mortgage rates decline, but we were still paying much higher rates of interest than corporations, banks and financiers.",2
2024-02-13,"if we'd all been given the opportunity to borrow a couple million dollars at 1% and put the easy money into bonds yielding 2.5%, skimming a low-risk 1.5% for producing nothing, we'd have jumped on it. but that opportunity was only available to banks, the super-wealthy, corporations and financiers. the chart below show the perverse consequences of offering the wealthiest few limitless money at near-zero rates while the rest of us paid much higher interest. the wealthiest few could buy income-producing assets on the cheap at carrying costs no ordinary investor could match. since there was so much ""free money"" sloshing around for financial elites to tap, the demand for income-producing assets soared, pushing prices into the stratosphere. these enormous increases in valuation generated stupendous capital gains for the wealthiest few. look at 2009 as the starting point in these charts, as that's when the federal reserve instituted zirp and opened the spigots of easy money to ""those with first access,"" i.e. banks, corporations and financiers. here we see how the assets of the top 0.1% more than tripled since 2009, far outpacing inflation. the net worth of the top 1% went ballistic as well. nearly free credit is rocket fuel if you're first in line and nobody else gets the same interest rate. the bottom 50% of american households lost ground in the era of easy money.",2

""there were no surprises in the fed statement,"" said wealthspire advisors' oliver pursche, adding that: ""it does appear that further rate hikes are off the table, which is a positive, but investors should continue to expect higher for longer as we're still quite a ways away from the sort of economic data that would push the fed to lower rates."" it is the old case of good news and bad news says art hogan of b.riley wealth: ""the good news is we can forget about any more tightening.",0
2024-02-05,"the bad news it's 'when', not 'if' they're going to cut rates, and that 'when' has been pushed out to what had been the fringes of consensus."" rates will dangle between 3.75% and 4% by year's end, soothsays the market. they presently range between 5.25% and 5.50%. the market assumption is that inflation is very nearly licked. it will retreat further yet, and the federal reserve can begin axing rates. is it true? we observe that the m2 money supply has expanded $100 billion since october. we further observe that supply chains remain, to a fair degree, unlinked. these do not suggest deflation or disinflation – but lingering inflation. the federal reserve claims it will not quit until inflation retreats to its 2% goldilocks rate. inflation, officially defined, runs at 3.4%. thus the federal reserve is within hailing distance of its 2% target. yet it is not within grasping distance. and so wall street's gleeful ""pivot"" may suffer postponement beyond even march. here is one additional reason we believe in a persistent inflation: experts are nearly unanimous that inflation is scotched. they believe the federal reserve will soon have this tiger back in its cage. and when experts are in one camp...we instinctively decamp for the opposing camp. we distrust crowds – expert crowds in particular. it is admittedly a bias, a disposition, a prejudice. we do not claim it is entirely rational. and events may prove us mistaken.",0
2024-02-05,"perhaps the federal reserve will finally seize inflation by the scruff. yet we cling to our instinct. is our judgment addled by a pessimistic pall? perhaps. yet one recent study indicates pessimism is realism. moreover, that pessimism is intelligence. the united kingdom's university of bath conducted a study, published in the personality and social psychology bulletin. from which: ""it is a puzzle why humans tend toward unrealistic optimism, as it can lead to excessively risky behaviour and a failure to take precautionary action. using data from a large nationally representative uk sample...our claim is that optimism bias is partly a consequence of low cognition – as measured by a broad range of cognitive skills, including memory, verbal fluency, fluid reasoning and numerical reasoning. ""we operationalize unrealistic optimism as the difference between a person's financial expectation and the financial realization that follows, measured annually over a decade. all else being equal, those highest on cognitive ability experience a 22% (53.2%) increase in the probability of realism (pessimism) and a 34.8% reduction in optimism compared with those lowest on cognitive ability. this suggests that the negative consequences of an excessively optimistic mindset may, in part, be a side product of the true driver, low cognitive ability."" more: ""the findings we present provide evidence that forecasting accuracy is linked to cognitive ability.",0
2024-02-05,"specifically, we find that higher cognitive ability is associated with a higher incidence of realism and pessimism in beliefs and a lower incidence of unrealistic optimism... ""alongside the large body of literature on unrealistic optimism sits the literature on overconfidence – overestimation or excessive precision in one's estimates of own ability (moore & healy, 2008). as with unrealistic optimism, overconfidence has been found to be a pervasive human trait with important affective benefits, such as maintaining self-esteem..."" is not overconfidence a distinguishing feature of experts? hard observation informs us it is. do they not believe in their superior sagacity? again, hard experience informs us they do. hence our disbelief in them. hence our disbelief in – or at least suspicion of – the 'inflation is licked' theory. this disbelief now finds validation in science. thus we are not pessimistic. we are, in the calculated conclusion of science, realistic. and realistic is superior to optimistic. of course, there is danger here. validated by science, we may be seduced by belief in our own sagacity. we may swing to the extreme belief that pessimism fully equals realism. we must therefore recognize limits. the science, we must concede, may be mistaken. it is even possible that optimism is realism.",0
2024-02-05,"germany's iron chancellor, herr bismarck, once argued that ""god looks after fools, drunks and the united states of america."" is their continued prosperity not the triumph of optimism over pessimism? we must concede that it is. a pessimist would wager against all of them. yet their continued prosperity cannot be denied. we cannot speak to god's future invigilation of fools and drunkards. yet he gives strong indication he is turning his gaze from the united states of america.",0
2024-02-04,"correlation breakdown x 3 in gold article:2024 gold price rising, demand to invest falls... weird things keep happening to the gold price, says adrian ash at bullionvault, breaking its correlation with other assets and – most starkly – snapping its relationship with gold's own market supply-and-demand fundamentals. most starkly, that's broken the inverse behaviour of consumers in china versus investing buyers in the west. take new year, for instance. january typically brings a bump in western investment inflows to gold. that pattern has tended to correlate with strong monthly gold-price gains. the strongest on the annual calendar, in fact. but although the gold price rose last new year, it slipped $10 per troy ounce in january 2024. demand to invest in gold fell both times. over the 20 years to 2023, gold prices rose in 14 januarys. while that was matched by november's winning strike rate, january's average gains beat that month hands down, rising 2.9% against 1.6%. right alongside, january typically saw a big pop in gold investment demand too (marked in red on our chart above) and no matter whether the pattern of flows either side was rising or falling. over the last decade, for instance, january brought more first-time users to bullionvault than the rest of the year's monthly average 7 times. gold-backed etf investment trusts showed a strong calendar correlation too. january saw net inflows to gold etfs 8 times in the 10 years to 2023.",0
2024-02-04,"that was well ahead of that market's average 56% month-on-month strike rate. why invest in gold at the start of the year? maybe the clear (but for now historic) correlation between january and a rise in gold prices became a reason to buy. maybe bullion demand rose as investors reviewed their portfolio risk, saw potential for trouble in the year ahead, and chose to add a little insurance. either way, 2024 proved different. so did new year 2023. gold etfs shrank last january, and last month those trust funds as a group saw their sharpest new year outflows since 2014, back when the precious metal was stuck in a deep bear market. bullionvault meantime just saw the weakest january for first-time gold investment since 2007, eve of the global financial crisis. yes, gold prices fell this january in us dollar terms, indian rupee and british pounds. but it rose in terms of euros, chinese yuan and japanese yen. more than that, gold in jan 2024 dropped less than us$10 from end-december's record-high finish of $2062 per troy ounce; gold actually rose last new year when investment demand also shrank; and most starkly, the broader correlation between gold's price and demand to invest has broken down anyway. or rather, the gold correlation between price and investment flows has broken down on the available data. time was, bullion-market analysts, traders and dealers could rely on the link between western gold investing flows and the dollar gold price like the sun coming up in the morning.",0
2024-02-04,"add together the size of gold etf holdings (95% of which back trusts listed on us, canadian, uk, eurozone or australian stock exchanges), plus hedge-fund and other speculators' bullish betting on comex futures and options, and – over the 15 years to new year 2023 – the correlation was relentlessly positive and almost always strong. on a statistical analysis, the movement of gold prices against gold investment flows across each rolling 12-month period gave an r-coefficient – on average – of 0.887. that number would read +1.0 if the price of gold always moved exactly in lockstep with its speculative demand; it would read minus 1.0 if they moved precisely opposite. and while no two things show a perfect correlation, the connection between gold prices and the size of gold etfs plus the comex net long position is the strongest relationship gold shows, stronger even that gold's famous correlation with the silver price. or at least, it was. because over the last 12 months, the correlation of gold's price in us dollars against the size of etf plus comex speculative net betting has sunk, falling to its lowest since at least 2006 down at 0.273. yes, that's still positive, but it's no longer strong. indeed, if we take that number and multiply it by itself to get what's called ""r-squared"" in statistics – also known as ""the coefficient of determination"" – then we see that the strength of the relationship has sunk by 9/10ths.",0
2024-02-04,"it's dropped from a median reading of 78.1% between new year 2008 and new year 2023, down to just 7.5% over the last 12 months. put another way, 2023 marked the first year since 2014 that the size of western speculative gold investment didn't move in the same direction as the gold price. it was the first time on record (back to 2006 on bullionvault's analysis) that prices rose while investment shrank. what changed? interest rates. gold pays no income, but cash in the bank – having paid zero in nominal terms since the global financial crisis began – now offers western savers a positive real return over and above inflation (or very nearly) for the first time in more than 15 years ago. time was, today's high interest rates would have crushed gold prices (another key gold correlation taking a big hit). but instead, gold prices are trading at or have just retreated a little from record highs, and that's hitting western investment demand still further, encouraging existing owners to take profits while also deterring new buyers – who can, after all, put their cash into bonds or the bank to get a positive real return 'risk free' instead. or they can pile yet more money into the go-go stock market. the nasdaq 100 returned 53.8% last year. facebook just started paying a dividend. who needs gold? of course, correlation isn't causation as any intro to statistics course will tell you. the fact that two things move together doesn't mean one is driving the other.",0
2024-02-04,"but for the price of gold, it makes sense that investment flows have tended to move together with prices. investors in any asset class tend to chase the price higher, and they tend to sell when it's falling. that's how bull and bear markets take hold, becoming longer-term trends in financial trading. consumers, on the other hand, tend to cut their demand for a good or service when it rises in price – especially if the price jumps – and that is how gold jewellery sales have typically worked among the precious metal's biggest consumer markets of india and china. india's households stuck to type last year, according to data gathered for and published by the mining industry's world gold council. counting jewellery, gold coins and small bars, they cut their bullion demand 3.4% by weight as rupee prices rose 15.5% inside the metal's no.2 consumer market. but demand in gold's no.1 consumer nation china actually rose 16.3% last year while shanghai's benchmark bullion price rose 17.2%, hitting a run of new all-time highs. that marks our third and perhaps most significant break of gold's typical price correlations. 2023 was the first year since 2017 that chinese households, faced with a rising gold price, bought more of the precious metal than the year before. you can spot this above, our third and final chart of key gold price correlations which have broken down.",0
2024-02-04,"over the 10 years to 2022, the weight of china's jewellery, coin and small-bar purchases pretty much mirrored the direction of gold prices. this meant that its consumers, instead of buying gold at rising prices like they had over the prior 10 years, were now behaving like their next-door neighbours in india. only more so. formerly gold's no.1 private buyer, india has been famous as the ""sink of the world"" for precious metals for 2,000 years and more. but its households haven't acquired perhaps 1-in-every-8 ounces of gold ever mined in history by chasing the price higher. on the contrary, they famously tend to sell or fade the spikes and buy the dips. which is smart. across the last decade, in fact, indian consumers' quarterly gold demand went in the opposite direction to rupee gold prices year-over-year 63% of the time. but the negative correlation was even stronger for china's household gold demand versus prices, with that figure coming in at 73%. simply put, china's consumers were even more price sensitive than india's famously gold-savvy households. up until early 2023. then something changed, and so far it has stayed changed too. boom times are back for china's private-sector gold demand, echoing the big jumps seen when the beijing dictatorship began to deregulate the domestic gold market in the early 2000s, even though chinese gold prices keep running to new all-time record highs. bullionvault first highlighted this switch last spring.",0
2024-02-04,"come the summer of 2023, it got so hot that the people's bank... ...which still controls the flow of bullion into china (and which, like india, blocks gold bullion's exit entirely)... ...put a limit on new imports by capping the number of import licenses it issued to chinese banks. maybe it was spooked by the outflow of dollars needed to pay for gold imports. maybe it was spooked by the upturn in private gold buying itself. either way, the net effect was to drive domestic chinese gold prices higher still... ...boosting the incentive for importers to all-time record highs, along with new record highs in the yuan price of gold as the shortage of supply failed to dent the strength of demand. what changed? while western investors have turned away from gold because of high interest rates and rising stock markets, chinese households face the opposite situation, plus a real estate crash. blocked from accessing the currency markets or foreign assets, they're left with gold as the standout choice, and surging demand in gold's no.1 consumer nation shows no sign of letting up. one week ahead of chinese new year – the biggest gold-buying festival in gold's biggest consumer market – shanghai gold prices have been running $50 per ounce above quotes in london, the precious metal's key trading and storage hub. known as the shanghai premium, this gap represents the gross cash margin for bullion dealers to buy gold in london and air-freight for sale in china.",0
2024-02-04,"and up at $50 per ounce, that incentive is running more than 10 times the last 10 years' average this close to lunar new year, suggesting very strong demand. what next? such strength in china's bid for gold is likely to see global prices fall when shanghai shuts for the week-long spring festival holidays on the evening of thursday, 8 february. historically it would be odd for western investors to buy that dip; price-sensitive trading is more usually associated with asian gold markets. but they already swapped roles last year. to repeat: 2023 marked the first time since 2014 that the size of western speculative gold investment (etps + comex managed money net long) didn't move in the same direction as the gold price, and it was the first time on record (back to 2006 on our analysis) that prices rose while investment shrank. 2023 also saw chinese households buy more gold than the year before even as prices jumped to new all-time highs. record high gold prices, western investor outflows, rising demand from china's consumers. this isn't how the global gold market is supposed to work. but the expert consensus says it's probably how gold is going to hold and reach yet more record highs in 2024, as the bid from china – the precious metal's no.1 mining, importing and consumer market – runs higher amid its worsening real-estate and stock-market slump. that's even before you look at china's central-bank or investment-sector gold demand. more to come soon on both those factors.",0
2024-02-01,"trump says 'no' to fed cbdc article:fed coin not gonna happen under the donald... at a recent new hampshire campaign rally, donald trump reiterated what he's been saying for months, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. central bank digital currencies (cbdcs) are dangerous and he would never allow one if elected.

2024-02-01,"these new electronic currencies are called cbdcs – or, again, ""central bank digital currencies"" (i like to call them ""biden bucks"" because i want biden to take full credit for what i consider to be crimes against american citizens). and these biden bucks would have the full backing of the us federal reserve. they'd replace the cash (""fiat"") dollar we have now. and if biden gets his way, they'd be the sole, mandatory currency of the united states. what does this mean for you? it would make your money less truly your own. it would be subject to government control, as donald trump said in new hampshire. we're already seeing how many retailers are no longer accepting cash across america. what happens when physical cash is eliminated altogether from any payment transactions? imagine this. to further advance his green new scam, what if joe biden and his cronies decide that gasoline needs to be rationed? your biden bucks could be rendered useless at the gas pump once you've purchased a certain amount of gasoline in a week! you want gas, but all you get is a one-word message: declined. how's that for control? biden bucks would create new ways for the government to control how much you can buy of an item, or even restrict purchases. it would keep score of every financial decision you make. in a world of biden bucks, the government will even know your physical whereabouts at the point of purchase.",2
2024-02-01,"it's a short step from there to putting you under fbi investigation if you vote for the wrong candidate or give donations to the wrong political party. if any of this sounds extreme, fantastical or otherwise far-fetched, it's not. recently, the fbi and financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) sent letters to us banks asking them to identify and provide a list to the government of customers using zelle, venmo and similar payment channels who mentioned ""maga"" or ""trump"" in their message traffic. they also asked for details on bookstore purchases of ""religious"" articles including bibles. finally, they asked for details on those shopping at cabela's, dick's sporting goods or bass pro shops, presumably on the view that those are places to buy guns and ammo. this is a clear-cut violation of the first amendment (free speech, freedom of religion), second amendment (right to bear arms) and fourth amendment (no unreasonable search and seizure). it's not a crime to write ""maga"" etc and therefore there's no reasonable basis for suspecting a crime, and therefore no right to get the information without a warrant, which requires a judge. any judge would likely reject the warrant request since there's no probable cause. this is an obvious case of profiling that may well involve ai. if you shoot someone and you're wearing a maga hat, you get arrested for the shooting, not the hat.",2
2024-02-01,"in this case, the hat is enough to put you under surveillance because you have been profiled as ""an enemy of the people"" by the government's definition. i predicted this kind of surveillance would arise with the use of biden bucks since the government would have your financial records and would not have to go to the banks or get a warrant. i'd like to say i was wrong, but unfortunately i was right. it looks like the fbi is not waiting for cbdcs. they're collecting the same information we said they would directly from the banks. i specifically warned that ""books"" would be one category the fbi would want to know about since it helps with the profiling. this goes hand in hand with prior revelations that the fbi was targeting traditional catholics (especially those who go to latin masses) for surveillance as possible terrorists. this is exactly why i sounded the alarm back in 2022. this administration is committed to not only taking control of your money with biden bucks, but also using the fbi and other government agencies to strip away your rights as citizens. that shouldn't surprise you if you've noticed how the administration has weaponized these agencies to punish their political opponents. fbi whistleblowers are also stepping forward to reveal that the fbi is lowering standards to recruit more candidates with ""left of center"" political views.",2

2024-02-01,"pboc now driving gold prices? article:like, this is news... a new report by bmo capital markets suggests that the price of gold is no longer being driven by real interest rates, writes frank holmes at us global investors. what replaced them? i unveil the answer below. first, the american consumer did it again. thanks in large part to a strong holiday shopping season, us gross domestic product (gdp) expanded at a faster-than-anticipated 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023. the results make the strongest case yet that the federal reserve has pulled off a soft landing, but they also raise questions about the timing of the central bank's next move...and where investors should allocate their capital. it certainly feels as if the economy has turned a new leaf, and the data appears to bear that out. at the end of last year, fed chair jerome powell's dovish pivot ignited hopes that the days of sky-high interest rates were numbered. his was bolstered by the federal reserve bank of new york's survey of consumer expectations, which shows that americans' inflation expectations have dropped to a two-year low. and the university of michigan found that consumer sentiment jumped this month to its highest level since july 2021. in december and january, the good vibes saw a cumulative 29% increase, representing the biggest two-month gain since 1991. businesses are riding the wave of positivity as well.",0

""gold and other commodity-driven equities have traditionally performed well during the next stages of the credit cycle,"" one of xib's founders, sean mcnulty, said in an email to clients, as reported by bloomberg. ubs recommends buying gold on dips below $2000 per ounce.",0
2024-02-01,"the swiss institution projects the yellow metal to rise as high as $2250 per ounce by year-end on looser monetary policy, which would put pressure on the us dollar and real rates, thereby boosting demand, particularly from gold-backed etfs. after three straight years of etf outflows, ubs predicts a shift to inflows, potentially sparking a sustained rise in gold prices. but as i mentioned at the top, bmo challenges this traditional view, suggesting that the relationship between gold and real interest rates has weakened. in a report titled ""new drivers for a new gold era"", bmo commodities analyst colin hamilton writes that the gold-real rate correlation, which i've written about many times, is now ""broken."" according to him, this correlation fell apart amid the sharp real rate moves of 2022 and has not been re-established. but if rates no longer matter, what's the investment case? hamilton argues that emerging economies' push to diversify away from the us dollar by increasing their gold holdings is now the most important driver of the metal going forward. china is particularly key. the people's bank of china (pboc) has become the world's undisputed gold purchasing leader, buying the metal uninterrupted since november 2022. last year, the bank announced a 225-tonne increase to its gold reserves, which reached 2,235 tonnes by the end of december. the yellow metal now accounts for 4.3% of china's official foreign exchange reserves, according to the world gold council (wgc).",0
2024-02-01,"as bloomberg's mike mcglone recently put it, ""a top reason [gold] has remained resilient is the deepest pockets on the planet – central banks – are accumulating at a breakneck pace."" in addition, 2023 was an especially tough year for many chinese investors, with stocks declining for the third straight year. the government is reportedly weighing a stock market rescue package backed by two trillion yuan, or roughly $278 billion, but it's worth pointing out that similar purchases in 2015 did not immediately lift stocks. surveys show that chinese households are not confident in the economy and are looking to save more and invest less in the stock market. according to hamilton, the proportion of chinese households holding higher levels of cash has correlated strongly to yuan-priced gold, which hit fresh highs in 2023 as the csi 300 index of chinese stocks sunk to a five-year low. given these dynamics, the major downside risk to gold prices this year could stem from a risk-on environment in china, such as an equity market rally. however, bmo and hamilton both expect central bank buying and household investment to be a multi-year theme. in this context, gold emerges not just as a safe haven in uncertain times, but as a strategic asset in a diversifying global economy.",0

2024-01-30,"and then, just for a moment, reality peeped through the veil. for a few minutes at davos 2024, argentina's president milei spoke truth to (delusions of) power. kate andrews for 'the spectator': ""...credit goes to the wef this year for inviting the antidote to the conference's misguided ideals – and giving him a platform on the centre stage. argentina's newly elected president javier milei's 23-minute speech swiftly and eloquently dismantled the underlying assumption of the davos conference: that the state and its friends tend to know best. in a total break with the usual platitudes spouted at davos, milei opted instead for an unabashed defence of free market capitalism – the only system, he said, which is really 'morally desirable' because of its proved outcomes for people. ""the president embraced his previous profession as an economist, starting his speech with a history of global growth and prosperity. what we see is an 'explosion' of growth once capitalism is adopted, he told the audience, which takes the 'shape of a hockey stick' (i.e. an exponential rise). 'thanks to free enterprise capitalism, the world is now living its best moment' he said. 'today's world is more free, more rich, more peaceful, and more prosperous than in any other time of human history.' ""but milei has no interest in living in the past: indeed he insisted that his country must provide a contemporary example of what can happen when socialism is implemented.",1
2024-01-30,"the president is currently working to stabilise the argentinian economy and prepare the way for classically liberal reforms as he tries to get a grip on the country's inflation rate, which currently sits at over 200 per cent. argentina should become the warning, he said, for what happens when western countries that 'got rich' off of a 'model of freedom' trade that freedom for the 'road to servitude'. ""'the main leaders of the western world have abandoned the model of freedom for different versions of what we call collectivism,' said milei. 'we're here to tell you that collectivist experiments are never the solution to the problems that afflict the citizens of the world – rather they are the root cause.' these shouldn't be considered extraordinary remarks to hear at an economics conference. sadly, they are. but his robust attack on socialism was not only a warning to fellow politicians. it was also a warning to business leaders – a call to arms for entrepreneurial 'heroes' to break with the cronyism of political friendships and contracts and to risk the competition of free markets. ""do not live in fear of the 'parasites who live off the state', he insisted. to the disappointment of his critics who keep trying to label the new president as 'far right', milei was not talking about those who might take benefits or rely on safety nets.",1
2024-01-30,"rather, he was talking about the bureaucratic class for whom a big state is necessary to preserve their way of life: a 'political class that wants to 'stay in power and retain its privileges'. it will have made for uneasy listening at a conference like davos, which is founded on the idea of bringing the state and business into closer partnership."" it is difficult not to conclude that the troubles of today's world are largely caused by distant, unaccountable globalist lobby groups populated by psychopaths. sprinkle in some high profile psychopaths from the corporate sector and the threat to the rest of humanity is all too palpable. how did the rot become so entrenched? as we argue in the book 'investing through the looking glass', just about everybody played a part, but we would single out bank executives, politicians and central bankers for especial credit in the debacle. bank executives horribly mismanaged their businesses, but rather than have those businesses painfully restructured and lose their jobs in the process, they pleaded innocence and got politicians and central bankers to bail them out instead. central bankers then ran with the ball in a game that politicians professed to ignore (namely fiscal stimulus, as opposed to wild monetary experimentation), and brought interest rates to where they sit today. the free market essentially got mugged, twice. interest rates matter, and it matters that they are set by a free market, and not by clueless technocrats.",1

2024-01-29,"the us currently spends about 3.5% of its gross domestic product (gdp) on national defense, which is significantly higher than what most countries spend, but it trails the military buildup of the 1980s, when outlays were closer to 7% and 8% of gdp. none of this is to suggest that the military has languished under president joe biden. the us already outspends the next 10 countries combined, and at the end of last year, the president signed the us defense policy bill, authorizing a record $886 billion in annual military spending. but with the world's geopolitical thermostat climbing, it's easy to see this budget going even higher – even topping $1 trillion. according to us under secretary of defense mike mccord, that eye-watering dollar amount is ""inevitable"" within just a few years. i believe this would carry clearly positive implications for defense stocks, but don't take it from me. in december, fitch ratings raised its outlook of the defense industry, writing that contractors ""will be supported by higher backlogs and elevated spending on national security."" that same month, the financial times reviewed the orderbooks of 15 global defense contractors, finding that their combined backlogs in just the first half of 2023 totaled a massive $764 billion. governments' ""sustained spending"" on defense ""has spurred investors' interest in the sector,"" the article reads.",1

2024-01-27,"2024 brings change, says bond market article:still not gold, but very useful signal... while it is far from the only important indicator for the markets, the treasury bond yield curve (10yr-2yr) is very important, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. that's because it takes what is probably the most important market for macro signaling (the bond market) and gives us a view into the dynamics between short and long-term yields. in the bond market, duration means a lot. for one example, long-term bonds are much more vulnerable to inflation's negative effects than short-term bonds. short-term bonds also act as a liquidity haven during deflationary market crises. long-term bonds can work quite well during disinflationary times and pay out better income than short-term bonds, but in a full out deflation scare when the very system (and its exponential debt load) comes into question insofar as you want bonds, you want short-term (in my experience 1-3 year treasury, t-bills and treasury money market). in other words, relative safety. from an american perspective, as long as the government says that stuff is safe it is safe. as long as the government is intact and functioning, that is. but it is only safe because of the fact that the governing body of a society long past its shelf life of sound monetary management says so.",2

2024-01-27,"downtrending bond yields (uptrending bond prices) signaled 'nope, no inflation problems here' (reality might have had a different opinion, but we are talking about the signaling of a heavily manipulated market) and this was implied license for big brained fed chair people and little brained politicians alike to create policy to inflate the system at all points of stress, let alone crisis. for many years we used the now-green moving averages (which can now be viewed as support for the new macro) as resistance to changing the macro. those ma lines used to be red as were the arrows. they were the backbone of the long-term disinflationary trend. in 2022, something broke and in my opinion, it was a profound move that we are tasked with interpreting correctly, now and in the coming years. the decades long disinflationary trend by which inflating policymakers were given license, is over. in my opinion, if they try their old tricks on bond yield pullbacks (eg, the big pullback we've seen over the last few months or even all the way back to the moving averages) the efficacy is not going to be the magical and heroic kicks saves of the past. the implication of the bond market rebellion of 2022 is 'enough!' in my opinion a saturation point was hit and the bond market could not sop up anymore of the chicanery (ie, inflationary bubble making by policy). the inflationary signaling of the broken continuum does not mean inflation as far as the eye can see, however.",2

""since the start of this century, national debt and gold have shared a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.9.",1
2024-01-23,"in simple terms, this means that both have tended to make similar moves day-to-day. ""[so] if you think debt is headed higher, it may make sense to consider an investment in physical gold and gold mining stocks."" simple, right? a bit too simple perhaps? over a period of months or years, any 2 things which have both risen in value are pretty much certain to show a positive correlation when you run the numbers through ""=correl"" on an excel spreadsheet. but that doesn't mean that they moved together in the meantime. on the contrary, they might have moved opposite more often than not. table of gold price correlations this table tracks the gold price in dollars, month-end data, against a range of other investment assets and economic factors. the first column shows you the 'simple' correlation. it calculates the 'r' coefficient between the price of gold in dollars with us government debt – as well as with the different investment assets and other economic factors listed – across the last 120 months. the second column, in contrast, looks at the correlation across each and every 12-month period. it then shows you the typical 12-month reading of the 'r' coefficient given across the last 10 years. see how it changes? then in column 3, you get the r-squared of that average correlation – a really boring spoilsport number which double checks the 'r' to see how closely 2 things are really correlated.",1
2024-01-23,"see how, for most of the relationships in our table, it completely undermines the shock-horror value of our first reading in column 1? take the nasdaq index of us corporate shares, for instance. across the past 10 years as a whole, the nasdaq shows a very strong r-coefficient with gold of +0.91. but that only really shows how stocks, like gold, have risen long-term. and within those 10 years, the nasdaq typically showed next to no correlation with the price of gold. the median 12-month reading was in fact slightly negative. very slightly. and it sinks pretty much to zero on the r-squared. ""in finance, an r-squared above 70% would generally be seen as showing a high level of correlation,"" says investopedia, ""whereas a measure below 40% would show a low correlation. this is not a hard rule, however, and will depend on the specific analysis."" put another way however, as one genuine statistics expert does, ""some fields of study have an inherently greater amount of unexplainable variation. in these areas, your r2 values are bound to be lower. for example, studies that try to explain human behavior generally have r2 values less than 50%. ""people are just harder to predict than things like physical processes"" in short. and gold-market prices, like equities or bitcoin or even the size of the us federal debt, are very human at root. now contrast the nasdaq with silver.",1
2024-01-23,"even though, in the first column above, silver's headline price correlation with gold is good and strong at +0.85, that reading comes below us government debt, below the nasdaq, and below the cpi cost-of-living index, too. but drill into the data, and silver's ancient and continued relationship with the price of gold jumps out. because on the median 12-month reading, silver shows the strongest correlation in our sample, and its r-squared with gold is streets ahead of anything else here. next strongest? real yields, meaning the rate of interest over and above the pace of inflation, offered by 10-year inflation-protected treasury bonds. that median 12-month 'r' with gold comes in at minus 0.64, a strongly negative reading that signals a much more powerful connection than gold prices show with bitcoin, for instance. yet across the past 10 years as a whole, the real yield shows a much weaker connection in column one. real yields' solid r-squared with gold also masks the big shock of gold's price action so far this decade... ...a shock which analysts, traders and pundits continue to highlight... ...gasping at how gold has shrugged off the steepest rise in real yields since pretty much forever, rising to new all-time highs against all major currencies and holding close to its all-time record highs in real terms, after you account for inflation, even as the real rate offered by tips bonds has jumped. correlations come and go over time.",1
2024-01-23,"and even when they hold firm, looking at just one measure across one time frame doesn't show you the whole picture. nor does looking at the correlation of just one thing against one other thing, either. us stocks, for instance, show a slightly stronger 10-year correlation with the us national debt than even gold does, up at 0.97 against gold's reading of 0.96 across the past 120 months. more notably over the last 10 years, the nasdaq's median 12-month correlation with the us national debt is very much stronger than gold's. it reads 0.69 against gold's figure of 0.50, and that gives the nasdaq an r-squared relationship with us national debt of 48%, beating even gold's rolling 12-month r-squared with the real interest rates on us tips bonds. but who ever told you to buy us stocks because of runaway us government borrowing? still, the continuing correlation of gold prices to the us national debt bears study. so as frank holmes at us global investors says, ""i believe [us government debt] is a good place to look if you want to know where gold may be headed in the coming months and years."" bullionvault users are starting to agree. our latest survey of what customers are thinking found that, when asked to name the biggest driver of precious metals' prices for 2024, bullion investors put 'monetary policy' at no.1 with 25.0% of all votes.",1

2024-01-22,"inflationary yield curve steepening? article:goldilocks might prove to have been so 2023... after a gentle disinflationary easing (goldilocks), the bond market is hinting at an inflationary steepening of the 10yr-2yr yield curve, writes gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. a yield curve can steepen under inflationary or deflationary pressure. inflationary: generally, long-term yields rise in relation to short-term yields as both rise nominally, or more importantly long-term yields rise nominally. deflationary: short-term yields decline in relation to long-term yields, as both decline nominally. thus far during the goldilocks phase from the stock market lows in october, the signal has been disinflationary relief as the 10 year treasury bond yield dropped from near 5% to 3.8%. the 2 year treasury bond yield has also dropped from the october high. but the yield curve, which is the product of the two yields above, shows the steepener still in progress after we noted in last week's public article that the recent goldilocks-friendly easing in the curve was merely a consolidation on the way to further steepening. now the break from consolidation is furthered and the steepening continues. it continues with the nominal yields shown above rising. hence, a little inflationary hint that will obviously need follow through in order to play out.",2
2024-01-22,"the decline in yields from october to december represented the best goldilocks had to offer in 2023 as our original thesis of pleasant disinflation played out, goldilocks style, at various times in 2023. it was a perfect accelerant for the anticipated seasonal (q4) party atmosphere, built on relief from a hawkish fed as inflation signals faded from the macro. in a recent nftrh, we began a very preliminary theme whereby the writer did not want to get caught in a self-congratulatory feedback loop, due to the correct disinflationary/goldilocks call a year ago. with the caveats of a still-bouncing us dollar and a bull-poised gold/silver ratio, the following was noted in the report's opening summary segment: ""inflation: as always, there is much more to be factored than one public article can illustrate. but 2023 was disinflationary, on cue, and today's soft-landers and goldilocks adherents were the inflation-phobes of a year ago. ""you see? some aspects are coming into play for an unexpected – if interim to a real deflation phase – inflationary phase. i am sure fiscal authorities will stand ready in support to try to boost the incumbent party in power, and the only trick in their book is and has been, fiscally stimulated inflation. with the fed sitting soft on the sidelines, that in itself would also be a tailwind. a hard deflation could be pushed out until post-election."" ""the strategy? we will manage that weekly in nftrh reports and during the week in nftrh+ updates.",2
2024-01-22,"but consider this; what are commonly referred to as the 'inflation trades' in commodity and resources related speculations, have already been hammered, much like the 2020 disinflation stuff like ark funds and cloud/saas got croaked prior to goldilocks, which re-lifted those boats. ""if the macro flips inflationary – even if only for a phase – the nearly sunken 'inflation trade' boats could sail again...for a phase, at least."" it is still very preliminary analysis. but my spidey sense says 'gary, don't over-stay your disinflationary view'. now let's see if the indicators back that notion up. if the yield curve resumes its steepening as expected and if that steepening is inflationary, as has been the little hint since mid-december, those confident about a goldilocks style soft landing will be disappointed and maybe even those willing to deploy trades in the opposite direction of 2023's disinflationary backdrop may find success.",2
2024-01-19,"time for shipping stocks? article:red sea violence hits global traffic... growing tensions in the red sea, a crucial artery for international trade, have sparked a significant shift in the shipping industry, writes frank holmes at us global investors. this shift, i believe, offers a compelling case for global shipping stocks. as many readers are already aware, iran-backed houthis have recently attacked tankers and cargo vessels sailing through the red sea, a passage used by about 12% of global trade. these disruptions, which are related to the israel-hamas war, have prompted shippers to seek alternative, though costlier, routes, including around africa's cape of good hope. the detour has had an immediate impact: soaring container freight rates. since tensions escalated last month, global rates have nearly doubled, a clear indicator of the increased costs incurred by carriers and passed on to exporters. according to drewry data, a company that paid about $1,400 to ship a 40-foot container at the end of november 2023 can now expect to pay more than $2,600 to ship the very same container. shares of shipping companies have jumped as a result. for the one-month period through january 9, israel's zim integrated shipping surged over 73%, the highest of any company in the solactive global shipping index. other top performers were hapag-lloyd, up 37% over the same period; ap moller-maersk, up 28%; and china's cosco shipping, with a 14% return.",0
2024-01-19,"the financial implications of the detours are substantial. an extended round trip between asia and northern europe is believed to cost an additional $1 million in fuel per vessel, and given the strategic importance of the suez canal, the rerouting of ships adds significant delays to cargo shipments, further inflating costs. remember the march 2021 incident where the ever given container ship ran aground in the suez canal? the six-day episode cost the global economy an estimated $9.6 billion a day. the current standoff in the red sea could have a similarly profound economic impact, albeit spread out over a longer period. the timing is also particularly sensitive, as china's lunar new year approaches – a period traditionally marked by an increase in shipping demand. even before the houthi attacks, maersk warned customers of ""exorbitant"" rates, ""additional peak season surcharges"" and a ""shortage of empty containers"" related to the chinese holiday. the cost implications are already visible. rates for shipping goods from asia to the mediterranean and north america's east coast have risen sharply. we believe this trend is likely to continue. the strategic significance of the red sea and suez canal cannot be overstated. these routes not only link europe with asia's major suppliers but also facilitate a substantial portion of the world's crude oil and oil products transport.",0
2024-01-19,"the diversion of tanker cargoes further escalates the demand for shipping, thereby increasing the ton-mile requirement, a key measure in the shipping industry. in a recent note to investors, bank of america outlined a ""doomsday scenario"" in which both the suez canal and panama canal, responsible for about 5% of global trade, become impassable. such an event would ""boost fleet demand between 1-2%,"" among other ramifications, bank of america analysts wrote. accurate or not, the current standoff presents a unique opportunity for investors to consider global shipping stocks, in my opinion. the hostilities are reshaping the logistics of international trade, leading to higher costs and extended transit times. the situation is likely to persist, offering a potentially lucrative method for investors seeking to capitalize on these developments.",0
2024-01-17,"boeing's double disaster article:stock in relentless descent... what happened to boeing, the former gold standard of american industry? asks jim rickards in the daily reckoning. nothing good, as i'll show you today. simply put, boeing isn't the company it used to be. by now, i'm sure you've heard about the jan. 6 near crash of a boeing 737 max 9 operated by alaska airlines, after the fuselage door blew off the plane. that caused decompression and the use of emergency oxygen. the door blew out because of a door-plug failure at about 16,000 feet. at that altitude, temperatures are freezing, and oxygen is quite low relative to sea level. the oxygen masks deployed, and passengers were able to secure them and hope for the best as the pilots tried to land the plane safely. an altitude of 16,000 feet is practically the highest altitude that the passengers and crew could have survived the ordeal. at altitudes of 20,000 or higher, the depressurization would have caused extreme instability and possibly crashed the plane. it's also likely that passengers and crew would have passed out before being able to secure the oxygen masks. at 30,000 feet, just slightly higher than the summit of mount everest, the plane certainly would have crashed. fortunately, the plane landed safely with only minor injuries despite badly shaken nerves. the fuselage door detaching was not the only disaster that occurred in those frightening minutes.",2
2024-01-17,"the depressurization also caused the cockpit door to blow open, which exposed the pilots to the extreme wind and noise going on in the back of the plane at a time when they were desperately trying to stage an emergency landing. cockpit doors have been required to be highly secure and open from inside the cockpit only since the 9/11 hijackings. this was an added shock to the pilots at a critical time. boeing later lamely explained that the cockpit door is supposed to blow open during an extreme depressurization incident. but they never put that critical detail in the operating manual, and the pilots on the alaska airlines flight had no idea that would happen. neither did many experts and engineers who were consulted by the media. this separate critical incident will only add to the scrutiny, liability and criticism that boeing is now experiencing for what is seen as gross incompetence. the double-door blowouts on the 737 max 9 were bad enough. of course, this comes not long after the double crashes of boeing 737 max 8 planes in indonesia in october 2018 and ethiopia in march 2019. these were due to software flaws that put the planes into dives that pilots hadn't been trained to counter. boeing's global fleet of 737 max 8 planes were grounded at that time. however, boeing was seen as slow to respond after the first crash. it was really the airlines themselves that took the lead in grounding their own planes.",2
2024-01-17,"boeing vowed internal investigations and improvements in quality control at that time. the flaws were subsequently corrected, but obviously problems remain. here we are just five years later with another quality control fiasco grounding another fleet of aircraft. the plane involved in the latest incident was basically brand-new. it wasn't an older aircraft that experienced metal fatigue. according to news reports, both boeing and alaska airlines had some indications that there were difficulties with the door plugs on the fuselage door. since the 737 max 9 is a relatively new model and the particular plane that suffered the door failure was, again, almost brand-new, engineers decided to ignore the warnings as just a kink that sometimes appears in new equipment and will self-correct or be easily adjusted. this was not the case; the manufacturer and operator were both receiving warnings of a potential catastrophic failure that they chose to ignore. boeing has now grounded its entire global fleet of 737 max 9s, about 170 aircraft in all. where did it all start going wrong for boeing? you can trace the answer to its 1997 merger with rival aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell douglas. that changed boeing's culture, and for the worse. boeing was known for its strong emphasis on engineering and quality control. it was part of the company's ethos. mcdonnell douglas, on the other hand, placed special emphasis on cost cutting and financial innovations to improve its bottom line.",2
2024-01-17,"it's not that it completely neglected quality control or that it didn't care about safety. obviously, airplane manufacturers can't afford to disregard them. it's just that it placed relatively greater emphasis on financial considerations than boeing. but after the merger, the mcdonnell douglas model began to encroach on boeing's traditional ethos. the engineering department was greatly reduced, for example, while the financial engineers went to work. starting in 2010, boeing spent tens of billions on stock buybacks and other financial machinations to enhance its share price. at the same time, the company took on massive amounts of debt. boeing's new ceo, harry stonecipher, even cited all this as a feature, not a bug. he was proud of it. he said, ""when people say i changed the culture of boeing, that was the intent – so run like a business rather than a great engineering firm."" what was the result? safety issues that resulted in two crashes and the latest close call. as one boeing engineer who worked on the 737 max said in 2019: this program was a much more intense pressure cooker than i've ever been in. the company was trying to avoid costs and trying to contain the level of change. they wanted the minimum change to simplify the training differences, minimum change to reduce costs and to get it done quickly. the irony is that by attempting to cut costs, boeing has suffered great costs. legal liability will be enormous.",2
2024-01-17,"business losses will also be huge based on grounding the entire fleet, identifying the defects and repairing them on all of the existing planes as well as making assembly adjustments to any work in progress. new safety protocols will have to be developed to make sure the problem does not reoccur, and pilots, crews and ground personnel will have to be retrained to look for future problems. the airlines will suffer losses from the groundings and will seek recourse from boeing. boeing stock fell from $265 per share on dec. 15 to $227 per share after the incident (about a 15% decline in three weeks). has boeing's stock already taken its hit on this fiasco? the answer is no. the market price has adjusted somewhat but the investigations are ongoing, and the costs of responding are being grossly underestimated. markets can be partly efficient but are not highly efficient and sometimes get taken in by ""all clear"" narratives put out by wall street that are far from the truth. this story has much longer to run, more negative facts will emerge, management changes are likely and the stock has much further to fall. i wouldn't be buying boeing right now.",2

2024-01-13,"three months – or less? how about $36 trillion after that? then $40 trillion? then $50 trillion? a $50 trillion economy can withstand a $36 trillion debt burden. it can likely withstand a $40 trillion burden. if the gods are kind...it may even withstand a $50 trillion debt burden. but the united states economy is not a $50 trillion economy. it is – perhaps – a $27 trillion economy. is economic expansion maintaining pace with this mushrooming debt? alas...it is not. set to one side the rebound year of 2021. not since 2005 has the gross domestic product exceeded 3% annual expansion. meantime, the congressional budget office projects average 1.8% annual growth through 2033. that is: debt gallops, growth crawls. thus, as we have argued before: the keynesian ""multiplier"" – the miracle of water into wine – has taken up division. it remains a multiplier only within the economics departments of ivied institutions and castles very high in the sky. a certain maya macguineas, presides over the committee for a responsible federal budget (do not laugh!). from whom: ""though our level of debt is dangerous for both our economy and for national security, america just cannot stop borrowing. this is a moment of consequence and continuing to refuse to pay our own bills will not lead us to where we need to be as a nation."" where do we need to be as a nation? we do not know. perhaps the gutter?",0
2024-01-13,"the united states government – the taxpayers of the united states, that is – presently shovel out $2 billion each day to service existing debt. how much more must they shovel out as the nation's debt takes its exponential leaps? we do not know. yet the figure will be plenty handsome. reports mr. bezos and his washington post: interest costs are already the fastest-growing part of the budget. net interest costs – a nonnegotiable expense – nearly doubled as a share of federal outlays between 2020 and 2023, going from $345 billion, or 5%, to $660 billion, or 10%. (defense, by comparison, cost $815 billion, or 13% of spending in 2023.) perhaps democracy dies not in darkness as mr.bezos claims – but in debt. what will be left for social security, medicare, medicaid, national offense and the rest of it? how will the united states afford its bread and its circuses? at the going rate...only with fantastic and herculean exertions. meantime, some 30% of united states government debt is poised to mature this year. much of this debt was taken on in a regime of drastically lower interest rates. upon maturation it must be refinanced at today's elevated rates. consider for example the 3-month treasury bill. the thing yielded nearly nothing in 2021. it presently yields over 5%. meantime, the 10-year treasury note yielded 0.50% in the hell-sent summer of 2020. it presently yields 4%. for years and years the boy has yelled wolf.",0

2024-01-12,"bitcoin etfs: when moon? not soon, says gold article:gold's warning from history. and btc's too... so bitcoin etfs finally got approved by the sec, writes adrian ash at bullionvault, with chief regulator gary gensler penning a press release so grudging, you'd think the applicants had just driven over his dog. still, you remember the old wall street saying, right? ""buy the rumor, sell the news."" it worked a charm for gold traders back in the mid-1970s. the old chestnut also worked for bitcoin fans in 2017 – just like, well, some people said. but again, only if the hodlers sold the hype rather than buying it, before prepping for the moon once again at much lower prices. two-thirds lower, in fact, inside 7 weeks. gold didn't quite make that plunge in 1975. but like bitcoin over the past decade or so, its volatility made it the seventies' hottest asset bar none (well, hottest besides silver in the hunt brothers' corner). in 1974 alone gold had doubled on a tide of hope and hype, long before gold-backed etfs like the spdr product (nysearca: gld) were even a twinkle in the eye of mining or finance-industry executives. runaway inflation sure helped. so did the federal reserve's timid response. more urgently for gold in 1974, and previewing the kind of hype just seen around bitcoin etfs from arkb to bitb and ibit and the rest, washington was finally set to end the 4-decade ban on us citizens owning and trading bullion coins or bars of the yellow metal.",0
2024-01-12,"most urgent of all in the 1970s, that meant gold futures trading could get started on us financial exchanges as well. ""the leverage available is large,"" said the new york times just before 31st december, when 4 exchanges were going to launch gold contracts to an eager us public. ""for example, the new york mercantile exchange, which offers the smallest contract, has a minimum margin requirement of only $500 for a 32‐ounce contract [then] worth perhaps $6,400."" derivatives brokers rushed to get ready, albeit limiting the ""speculative debut of gold futures"" to what the world would now call 'high net worth' punters. to sate the rest of the lumpeninvestoriat, banks and dealers and retailers all rushed to stockpile gold coins and small bars ahead of the big day. because yes! it's finally happening!! here we go!!! but no. gold actually fell as 1975 began. by the summer of 1976, it had almost halved in price, down from near-$200 per troy ounce towards $100, back where it had ended 1973. fast forward 4 decades, and the hottest number-go-up of the 2010s was all set for a moonshot too. again, the idea of leveraged betting lit the fuse. the launch of bitcoin futures contracts – announced that august by the chicago board options exchange – would surely send the crypto-currency higher than anyone dare dream. which they did on their advent, only to see the thing crash almost the moment they became flesh. ahead of the cboe launch, bitcoin in 2017 mooned a lot faster than gold had in 1975.",0
2024-01-12,"maybe cos it's weightless? maybe cos the rocket-fuel of cheap money was now fired through the boosters of social media hype and shysters? either way, the ""future of money"" leapt 19-fold in 2017 as crypto's own ""big day"" drew near. the start of the xbt futures contract meant, to quote one true believer, that ""institutional corporate money is now about to enter the land of bitcoin!"" cue lots of money to chase the thing higher in advance. bitcoin rose 56% inside one week that december, fast out-running anything gold has ever achieved as the cboe's launch-day for legally approved leveraged btc trading approached. but then, when the rumor became a fact? after btc usd surged 20 times in price ahead of the cboe futures launch, it really wasn't that hard to guess what came next. any idiot could do it ( and did). but here in 2024, bitcoin's etf approvals are playing out differently so far. which makes guessing what comes next much harder. oh sure, the promoters got busy. after all, they've had 11 years of practice since the least sympathetic characters in the social network were first rebuked by us regulators at the sec after asking it to sign off exchange-traded products backed by holding btc. and sure, the true believers on social media has been working overtime too.",0
2024-01-12,"mostly summed up as ""here we go!!!""... ...or ""mega #btc explosion coming""... ...or adding a little variety by claiming that 'china' is desperate to get into btc etfs too, creating such wonderful word soup as ""full nation state adoption game theory in effect."" but this time, instead of mooning ahead of the fact, bitcoin has struggled to extend the up-move it started in late-2022. finally bottoming 75% beneath its new covid stimmy-check peak of 12 months before, bitcoin has gone on to reach 21-month highs. yet take-off day this week – when the sec finally admitted what its own errant tweet had said a day earlier, and announcing the move several hours after us brokerages began listing the 11 new bitcoin etf products on their retail-investor platforms – found btc rising barely 1.0% higher out in the wild (the kind of move it's beaten, up or down, on nearly 2-in-3 of all days across the last decade) while the now-live etfs actually dropped in price. still, this all ""demonstrates bitcoin is winning"". or so 2024's hodlers want to believe. ""the existing financial system is being pulled into its black hole. ""to. the. f**king. moon."" but bitcoin didn't moon in advance of the new us products, and it hasn't (so far) mooned on their launch either. what's more, bitcoin etfs in themselves aren't new. canada got a bunch starting in november 2021, with the purpose bitcoin cad etf (tse: btcc.b) followed by fidelity's product (tse:fbtc).",0
2024-01-12,"it carried (and still carries) an expense ratio of 0.95% for keeping its crypto stacked in fidelity's own cold storage in-house. it turned $10,000 invested into $3,000 within 12 months, recovering to $8,230 today with around us$140m of assets. as for bitcoin futures – now dominated by the all-conquering cme derivatives exchange – the cboe last november announced it would launch new contracts this thursday, 11 january 2024. which seems a happy coincidence. and the cboe's bitcoin contracts could do with a fair wind. because in march 2019 – and with ""money of the future"" buying only 1/4 as many fiat dollars as it did at the christmas 2017 top – the cboe had what cnbc charitably called ""a change of heart"", ending its first foray into btc futures and letting the last of them expire that june. so maybe another history lesson from gold might apply. because gold etfs also marked a much-hyped step in that asset's long-term path upwards. and ""when the first gold etf became available in march 2003, it was a good time to start marketing gold as it had risen steadily from $250 to $350,"" as the category's true pioneer graham tuckwell – now chairman of etfs capital – noted in 2021, looking back almost 2 decades. anticipation of gold etfs was, of course, much smaller 2 decades ago than the hope and hype we're seeing around us bitcoin products today. back then, etfs idea were still very new as an idea and unproven for sucking in retail or institutional dollars.",0
2024-01-12,"so while gold set a 7-year high one month before tuckwell's gold etf launched for australian investors – and while it then decisively broke above its 20-year ceiling around $400 when the big gld gold etf launched in november 2004 for us investors – that rise looked (and still looks) much more about gold's underlying uptrend than about any product-specific mooning. maybe that's where bitcoin now sits, somewhere on a long-term uptrend that could keep on rising. but the anticipation and anticlimax of btc etfs to date suggest that maybe, just maybe, the days of moon-shots and laser eyes and even of sudden 70% plunges or 90% crashes are over. maybe. if so, that wouldn't mean btc can't badly hurt your portfolio anymore. physical bullion, after all, lost 25% inside 3 months in the 2013 gold price crash fuelled by (you guessed it) a rush for the exits by gold etf shareholders. but it might mean that a slower, less volatile and moon-free bitcoin does at last become more widely acknowledged as an investable asset. beyond that, bitcoin still isn't money today. indeed, the long-awaited arrival of us etfs looks like the final nail in that coffin. and nor is bitcoin gold. getting sec approval for etf investment funds doesn't change any of that.",0
2024-01-09,"commodities 2023 review and outlook article:each new american needs 3 million pounds of resources... the united states is adding new renewable energy capacity at a record clip, but that doesn't mean it's ready to quit fossil fuels just yet, writes frank holmes at us global investors. the country just became the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (lng) for the first time ever, with last year's shipments hitting an unprecedented 91.2 million metric tonnes, exceeding top suppliers australia and qatar. the surge in lng exports, primarily driven by freeport lng's return to full service and robust global demand, particularly from europe, signifies america's pivotal role in the global energy market. the us also remains the world's largest oil producer. in october, the energy powerhouse generated a staggering 13.25 million barrels per day, marking only the fourth month on record that the country met or surpassed 13 million barrels per day on average. it's against this backdrop that we share with you our always-popular, interactive periodic table of commodities returns, updated to reflect 2023 data. commodities as a whole had a challenging year, with the group finishing down 12.55% due to a number of factors, including rising rates, recession fears and china's disappointing pandemic reopening. excess supply contributed to the drawdown.",0
2024-01-09,"despite strong global demand, the price of natural gas plunged nearly 44%, its worst year in at least a decade, largely as a result of record-high production. according to the energy information administration (eia), the us produced an astonishing 104.9 billion cubic feet per (bcf/d), a new monthly high. after topping the list of commodities in the previous two years, lithium prices cratered for very much the same reason in 2023. this, combined with news that americans' appetite for electric vehicles (evs) may be waning, drove the battery metal down to prices last seen in summer 2021. i believe these lower prices set up an attractive buying opportunity. commodities are the building blocks of everything we use and enjoy on a daily basis, and as the global population expands, so too does demand for these materials. the minerals education coalition (mec) estimates that every american born in 2023 will require over 3 million pounds of metals, minerals and fuels over the course of their lifetime. last year alone, over 40,000 pounds of raw materials, from cement to sand to aluminum, were needed for every person in the us. gold was the number one commodity and only one of two that finished the year in the black, copper being the other commodity (just barely). the precious metal rose 13.10% to close the year above $2,000 per ounce for the very first time, and with an average 2023 price of $1,943, it managed to notch its eighth straight annual gain.",0
2024-01-09,"gold has now advanced in 20 of the past 24 years, or 83% of the time. looking ahead to the end of 2024, i believe we'll see a fresh boost in gold's investment case once the federal reserve begins trimming rates. support should also come from central banks, which bought a record amount of gold in the first nine months of the year. financial institutions purchased a net 800 metric tonnes from january to september 2023, a 14% increase from the same period in 2022, according to the world gold council (wgc). china easily led all other countries, accumulating 181 tonnes of gold in the first nine months, as it seeks to prop up its currency and diversify away from the us dollar. the wgc estimates that gold now represents just 4.3% of the country's total foreign reserves, compared to nearly 70% for the us if china were to get to america's level, it would need to buy an additional 33,810 metric tonnes, which is 10 times more gold than the entire world produced in 2022. before moving on, i'd like to point out that us national debt just crossed above $34 trillion for the first time, the equivalent of $101,000 per us citizen, or $264,000 per taxpayer. i believe this is a good place to look if you want to know where gold may be headed in the coming months and years. since the start of this century, national debt and gold have shared a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.9. in simple terms, this means that both have tended to make similar moves day-to-day.",0
2024-01-09,"if you think debt is headed higher, it may make sense to consider an investment in physical gold and gold mining stocks. on the energy side, the renewable energy market saw significant strides in 2023, with over 440 gigawatts of added capacity. notably, both the us and europe set new benchmarks for solar installations, while china's contributions dwarfed everyone else's, adding between 180 and 230 gigawatts (gw). wood mackenzie, however, forecasts a slowdown in the growth rate of annual solar installations this year. despite this, the global solar market remains substantially larger than it was a few years ago, following a typical s-curve pattern of rapid growth followed by gradual maturation. this build-out is expected to benefit silver in particular, a key mineral found in photovoltaic (pv) panels. on a final note, 2024 is an election year, and it appears more and more likely that we'll have a second rematch between incumbent president joe biden and donald trump. i expect to see heightened vitriol and animus this year compared to past cycles, given that both men are deeply unpopular and facing either criminal charges or an impeachment inquiry. as unpleasant as this election is shaping up to be, i don't predict substantial effects on the market. believe it or not, the s&p 500 has never declined in a presidential re-election year, and historical data doesn't support the notion that election outcomes profoundly influence us stock market returns over the long term.",0
2024-01-09,"other factors are more crucial in driving stock market trends. therefore, i advise that investors concentrate on underlying economic conditions. in an election year, the most effective investment strategy, in my view, is to maintain a diversified portfolio instead of pursuing short-term, tactical bets.",0

""as we enter 2024, be open to the possibility that last year's winners will not take the crown this year."" we are indeed open to that alarming possibility. a low p/e ratio indicates stocks are cheap. a high p/e ratio indicates stocks are dear. the lower the valuation...the higher returns investors can expect across the next several years. the opposite likewise holds true. elevated valuations imply diminished returns across the next several years. a p/e ratio of 17 is about par...as history runs. that is, p/e ratios below 17 indicate stocks are cheap. above 17 stocks are expensive.",2
2024-01-08,"what is today's p/e ratio for these gargantuas? s&p global informs us that the current ratio for these stocks registers a galactic 42.8. – some 2.5 times par. investors in these stocks are offering to shovel up $42.80 for each $1 of earnings. handsome! if the term ""mean reversion"" has anything in it – and we believe it does – these investors are in for a good whaling. the technology sector's overall p/e ratio presently flies along at 33. if their ratios remain unchanged, s&p global informs us these stocks may leap 25.2% this year. yet what if these ratios revert to their 2022-23 average? these stocks may merely yield 8.2%. and if their p/e ratios retreat to their 2017-19 averages? these market makers may yield -18.6%. that is, negative 18.6%. thus the market pushers would become the market pullers. the stock market's colossal assets would become its colossal liabilities. and the hordes that flocked into them would as rapidly flock out of them. would the remaining 493 stocks of the 500 assume the locomotive's controls...and power the freight train on? it is possible. yet which ones? if they now must be pulled...how could they push? let us consider the s&p 500 in the aggregate. its combined p/e ratio presently reads 24.6. that ratio tracks far beneath the magnificent seven's 42.8 and the technology sector's 33 average. yet recall: 17 is par. thus the s&p 500 is overvalued by this metric. not fantastically overvalued. yet it represents no bargain at the going price.",2

2024-01-08,"the gross domestic product hovers at $27.6 trillion. total stock market capitalization, meantime, runs to $47.49 trillion. that is, the stock market is ""significantly overvalued"" relative to the gross domestic product. a 1.72 ratio does not represent a 2.1 or 2.6 lunatic derangement, it is true. it nonetheless represents an overvalued stock market – in buffett's telling at least. of course this buffett indicator is no crystal sphere. it reveals neither day nor hour of reckoning. it merely takes the overall view. and the overall view is overvaluation – again, in mr.buffett's telling. what does an overvalued stock market imply for the following decade? bloomberg: ""a monster 10 years for us stocks has showered money on the buy-and-hold faithful and made virtually every other asset class an also-ran.

2024-01-07,"how would you like your landing? article:hard or soft, a landing is coming... soft landings, it has been said, are the holy grail of monetary policy, writes frank holmes at us global investors. there may be signs that we're on the cusp of one. but what does it mean for the economy in 2024 to have a soft landing? and conversely, what constitutes a hard landing? simply put, a soft landing occurs when the federal reserve manages to curb inflation without triggering a sharp increase in unemployment or pushing gdp growth into negative territory. a hard landing, on the other hand, is when interest rates rise and inflation decreases, but at the cost of a recession and high unemployment. achieving a soft landing is exceptionally challenging. noted mit economist rudi dornbusch (1942-2002) famously quipped: ""none of the post-war expansions died of old age. they were all murdered by the fed."" indeed, out of nine tightening cycles over the past five decades, the bank successfully engineered a soft landing only twice. the other seven instances culminated in recessions. princeton economics professor alan blinder offers some hope. if the need to combat inflation is not too extreme, he writes in a recent article, the fed has demonstrated its ability to orchestrate an economic landing that either avoids a recession or induces a relatively mild one.",0
2024-01-07,"the central bank's reputation for causing hard landings ""derives mainly from conquering the 1970s inflation – which took three landings,"" blinder says. the key to predicting the outcome in 2024 lies in economic indicators, especially as experts project the consumer price index (cpi) in the us to decline to 2.7% while the fed's target rate is expected to reach 4.50% by the end of the year. despite the occasional gloomy predictions and forecasts, investors should be cautious about buying into the ""america-is-in-decline"" narrative, merrill points out in its weekly capital market outlook. america's share of global gross domestic product (gdp), estimated at 26% for 2023, has increased from 24.8% at the start of the decade. over the past four years, the us economy has added an additional $6 trillion to its economic base, bringing total us output to around $27 trillion. most impressively, since the beginning of the decade, the s&p 500 has consistently outperformed most developed and emerging markets. investors were treated to a promising holiday season, characterized by strong consumption. mastercard reports a year-over-year increase of +3.1% in us retail sales, excluding automobiles, during the 2023 holiday shopping season from november 1 through december 24. this measure encompasses both in-store and online retail sales across all payment forms and is not adjusted for inflation. finally, the santa claus rally appears to be in place.",0
2024-01-07,"this phenomenon describes a period where the stock market closes higher during the last five trading days of the current year and the first three trading days of the new year. ""where else in the world is there an economy that leads or dominates in so many diverse industries, ranging from agriculture to aerospace, education to entertainment, and technology to transportation, to name just a few sectors?"" asks joseph quinlan, head of merrill's market strategy. i couldn't have said it better myself. in the context of a potential soft landing, historical trends suggest that gold may not perform as strongly. according to the world gold council (wgc), soft landing environments have typically resulted in flat to slightly negative average returns for gold. however, every cycle is unique, and 2024 may bring surprises. heightened geopolitical tensions in a key election year for many major economies, combined with continued central bank buying, could provide additional support for gold. central banks and official institutions have played a pivotal role in boosting gold's performance over the past two years, with the wgc estimating that excess central bank demand added 10% or more to gold's gains in 2023. this trend is likely to persist, potentially providing an extra boost to gold prices in 2024. in the event that a recession becomes a reality, weaker growth could help steer inflation back toward central bank targets, eventually leading to interest rate cuts.",0
2024-01-07,"such an environment has been conducive to both gold and high-quality government bonds, making them appealing options for investors, the wgc says. as we enter 2024, it's essential for investors to remain vigilant, monitor economic indicators closely and consider the various possibilities that lie ahead. while the prospect of a soft landing offers optimism, the financial landscape remains subject to change. by recognizing the strength of the us in the global economy and staying attuned to market dynamics, investors can position themselves for success in the new year.",0

""the government,"" he said, ""must...be free to consider every proposal likely to help, such as tariffs, expansion of exports and contraction of imports..."" the conservative dominated coalition not only took britain off the gold standard but imposed a range of tariffs. such was the fashion; one-third of parliament's liberals now supported protection and ""in the spring of 1931 keynes announced publicly his support for a revenue tariff,"" barry eichengreen writes, basing ""his argument on the reduction of unemployment."" richard cobden's achievement was repudiated. the tariffs enacted by the conservatives were part of an international movement toward economic autarky which saw trade shrivel in the early 1930s and reaped a bitter political harvest. it would take many years of hard work to undo them.",2

2023-12-27,"if gold is the ultimate safe haven for investors and the world has been dangerously unsafe, then the price of gold must have been skyrocketing, right? that's not the case. today gold is about $2052 per ounce. gold has experienced a surge lately, but that's still lower than the $2069 all-time high of aug. 6, 2020. the bottom line is gold is lower today than it was three years ago. there have been some spills and thrills along the way including two peaks over $2000 and several smashes down into the $1680 range, but always followed by a reversion to a persistent central tendency that hasn't moved much at all. so we're back to the original question. with inflation, shortages and war all around, why is gold not surging past $3000 per ounce and making its way to $4000, $5000 and beyond? supply/demand conditions favor higher gold prices. global production of gold has remained fairly constant for the past seven years. over the same seven-year period, during a period when global output was flat, central banks increased their official holdings by over 6%. china has added over 1,400 metric tonnes in the past 13 years (that's the official number; unofficially they probably own far more). russia has acquired over 1,500 metric tonnes over that same period. other large buyers have included poland, turkey, iran, kazakhstan, japan, vietnam and mexico. central banks in the visegrad group (czech republic, hungary, poland and slovakia) have also bought gold.",0
2023-12-27,"what's curious is that individual investors in the us still seem indifferent to gold as a monetary asset. in theory, central banks are the most knowledgeable about the real condition of the global monetary system. if central banks are buying all the gold they can with hard currency (dollars or euros), it's not clear what retail investors are waiting for. of course, central bank holdings are only about 17.5% of total aboveground gold and there is far more demand from bullion investors and for jewelry (a form of wearable wealth). still, central banks are arguably the most knowledgeable market participants, and their steady increases in gold holdings is meaningful. interest rates also play a supporting role. many of the directional moves in gold prices over the past three years have been tied to interest rate moves. the correlation is not perfect, but it is strong. the rally in gold prices in late 2020 was tied to a fall in interest rates (yield-to-maturity) on the 10-year us treasury note from 1.930% on dec. 19, 2019, to 0.508% on july 31, 2020. similarly, the fall in gold prices after february 2021 was tied to an increase in interest rates on the 10-year treasury note from 1.039% on jan. 2, 2021, to 3.130% on may 2, 2022. rates are 3.92% as of today. but i believe that interest rates on the 10-year treasury note will fall again and will continue to fall as global growth weakens. we're already seeing that. over the past two months, yields have fallen from 4.92% to 3.92%.",0
2023-12-27,"in bondland, that's a major move. that's good news for gold investors. short-term rates had been going up because of fed policy, but now the fed has signaled markets that it's done raising rates. that's a tailwind for gold. while market supply/demand conditions are favorable for gold, and the overall interest rate environment is also favorable for gold, neither has seemed to have the power needed to push gold sustainably past $2000. what's the problem? the real headwind for gold and the main reason gold has struggled to gain traction for the past three years has been the strong dollar. after all, the dollar price of gold is really just the inverse of the strength of the dollar. a weaker dollar means a higher dollar price for gold. a stronger dollar means a lower dollar price for gold. it may seem paradoxical to imagine a strong dollar in the midst of all the inflation we've been seeing. but that's the case. what's extraordinary over the past three years isn't that gold hasn't soared; it's that gold has held its own in the face of a persistently strong dollar. so that leads to the next question: what's been behind the strong dollar and what could cause the dollar to suddenly weaken and send gold prices into the stratosphere? the strong dollar has been driven by a demand for dollar-denominated collateral, mostly us treasury bills, needed as collateral to support leverage on bank balance sheets and in hedge fund derivatives positions.",0
2023-12-27,"that high-quality collateral has been in short supply. as banks scramble for scarce collateral, they need dollars to pay for the treasury bills. that fuels dollar demand. the scramble for collateral also speaks to fears of a sequel to the banking crisis in the wake of this year's earlier failures. we're not there yet, but we could be getting close. the crisis is by no means over. as weak growth likely turns into a global recession, a new financial panic will be on the horizon. at that point, the dollar itself may cease to be a safe haven, especially given the aggressive use of sanctions by the us and the desire of major economies including the brics nations to avoid the us dollar system if possible. when this panic hits and the dollar is deemed no longer reliable, the world will turn to gold. that's not an immediate likelihood. this is a process that'll unfold over years. but the trend is going in that direction. investors should consider today's gold prices a gift to acquire gold at bargain prices before markets, and the mainstream media, wake up. even at $2052, gold is so cheap right now, it's practically a steal.",0

2023-12-22,"the fed's critical transition article:no longer raising, set to cut... the fed rate remained unchanged as a result of the fomc meeting last week. but what's the future look like? asks jim rickards in the daily reckoning. today, i'll explain what happened in terms of policy moves, what fed chair jay powell believes will happen next and what will actually happen. the difference between powell's expectations and market expectations creates opportunities for investors to profit from those competing forecasts. whether we see the dow plummet over the next few months, or a weakening economy with a recession imminent, you've got a front-row seat to research, strategies and recommendations that can help you weather the storm and profit. last week the fed kept the fed funds rate unchanged. at the same time, they leaned in a more dovish direction with regard to their next policy move, while warning that rate hikes are still on the table in certain circumstances. it's important to look at the fed's reasoning behind its moves and to consider what's next both for the fed and the us economy. fed chair jay powell's press conference following the announcement is always more informative than the official announcement and this meeting was no exception. powell's insistence on flexibility going forward is obvious. as has been the case since last summer, powell is caught on the horns of a dilemma. on the one hand, inflation remains too high.",0
2023-12-22,"on the other hand, if powell raises rates or simply holds them too high for too long, the inflation could turn to rapid disinflation or even deflation accompanied by a recession. powell understands the dilemma, but he does not know which way to turn. his solution is to do nothing and wait for more data. that said, the meeting was highly significant in the sense that the fomc statement and powell's remarks were dovish. the fed turned from a possible rate hike to a possible rate cut as their next move. nothing was set in stone and no clues were given as to timing, but the tilt toward easing instead of more tightening was unmistakable. of course, powell tried to have it both ways. he said, ""inflation has eased from its highs...without a significant increase in unemployment."" in the next breath he said, ""inflation is still too high."" the way to reconcile these statements is to understand that while inflation may be too high, interest rates may be high enough to combat the inflation without further rate hikes. that's the definition of the ""terminal rate"" and that's where jay powell believes the fed is right now. specifically, powell said rates are, ""likely at or near the peak rate for this cycle,"" and ""the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt."" that's another way of saying we're at the terminal rate.",0
2023-12-22,"as if to hammer the point home, powell said, a rate hike ""is not the base case anymore as it was 60, 90 days ago."" powell left a few markers that rate hikes might still be needed if the economy does not play out as expected. he said, ""we still have a ways to go. no one is declaring victory. that would be premature."" he added that wages are running higher than what would be consistent with the policy goal. that's a sign that demand-driven inflation could be on the horizon in place of supply-side inflation, which is waning. to keep his options open, powell went on to say, ""we will need to see further evidence...that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,"" and, ""we are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate."" one of powell's more intriguing comments was that the fed would cut rates before inflation hits the 2.0% target. the idea is that if inflation falls from 3.2% to, say, 2.5%, the fed might cut rates at that stage. the view is that with inflation falling quickly, it could overshoot the 2.0% target and end up at 1.0% or lower. that's a reason to cut rates when inflation is still 2.5% and then watch inflation glide smoothly to the 2.0% target. all of this gives the fed too much credit for finesse. they're not as nimble as this analysis makes them sound. but the remarks do give insight into their thinking, which will help with forecasting in the future. powell also wrestled with an arcane point raised by a reporter.",0
2023-12-22,"if inflation falls faster than nominal rates, that means real rates are going up. the real rate is simply the nominal rate minus inflation. if nominal rates are stuck at 5.5% and inflation drops from 3.2% to 2.5%, then the real rate went up from 2.3% to 3.0%. that's a different form of tightening but one which could cause the fed to cut rates quickly if inflation falls quickly. powell also reminded reporters that ""we're not talking about altering the pace of qt right now."" qt is quantitative tightening, another form of monetary tightening. so even without interest rate hikes, the fed is still running a tight money policy. powell took a nod in the direction of a recession when he said, ""maybe people bought so much stuff that they temporarily don't want any more stuff."" that's a reference to a recent slowdown in consumer spending. markets loved the dovish tilt despite the nuance about real rates and recession. stock indexes rose about 1.4% to new all-time highs. gold rallied 2.5% to $2045 per ounce. the yield on the 10-year treasury note plunged from 4.2% to 3.9%, producing huge capital gains in treasury notes. even oil futures rose to $74.50 per barrel up from $69.00 earlier in the day. we'll see how long the optimism lasts, especially in the face of recessionary signs. for now, markets want to party like it's 1999. on the whole, last week's meeting was important considering that the fed didn't actually do anything.",0
2023-12-22,"the tilt away from hawkishness toward dovishness was critical. it triggered rallies in stocks, bonds and gold – what some traders call an ""everything rally"". the next fed meeting is jan. 30-31, 2024. a lot will happen between now and then including more data on inflation, unemployment and economic growth that will affect the fed's decision-making process. i'll be watching all of it carefully and bringing you the latest analysis as events unfold.",0

2023-12-20,"on an annual average basis, 2023 saw the us fed's key interest rate jump by a massive 7 percentage points once you account for inflation. that's steeper even than the real-rate hike of 1981, imposed to kill the prior decade's double-digit inflation at the cost of a deep economic recession. that year's jump of 6 percentage points in real us interest rates saw the value of gold bullion plunge by 32% from what remains a modern-era record, the heaviest ever real terms loss on bullionvault's analysis of 100 years of historical data. yet in 2023, in contrast, the real price of gold actually rose, adding more than 3% on an annual average basis. how did gold overpower the kryptonite of steeply higher real rates? supported by household demand for jewelry, small bars and coins, the price of gold most often shows a strong, positive correlation with the level of private-sector investment demand. but in 2023, private inflows to gold bullion were crushed by record high nominal gold prices, plus the highest interest rates in two decades. germany's formerly world-leading coin and small-bar demand, for example, has sunk by 80% net of investor selling, while the total size of gold-backed exchange-traded trust funds listed in the uk and europe has shrunk by nearly 11%, with north american-listed products shrinking almost 5%. so who was buying? central banks.",0

2023-12-20,"but i don't think they are going to experience the same level of market domination in 2024. no, it's not likely market-leading nvda is going to rally another 250% next year. it probably won't crash – but i sincerely doubt we'll see a repeat performance of 2023's historic performance. instead of an impending crash due to a top-heavy market, we're seeing the beginning of a rotation away from mega-caps into tech laggards and small-cap stocks – a rotation that has become more pronounced over the past week. last week, the fed elected to hold rates steady. the market was expecting no action – so that's not what sparked the rally. instead, the fed's dovish comments started the feeding frenzy. powell declared that inflation has eased (finally) and market participants can expect it to be less of a problem in 2024. how you personally feel about these comments or the probability of a so-called ""soft landing"" doesn't matter. what's important is how the market interpreted the news, and this is the message stock sent: for starters, hikes are likely done. and it's becoming very likely that we'll see some cuts next year, possibly as early as march. more importantly, this fed meeting was the last real obstacle for the melt-up rally to scale into year-end. i don't see anything else on the calendar standing in our way as 2024 approaches. the nasdaq composite, s&p and dow all jumped about 1.4% following the release of the fed minutes. and the good vibes continued through the end of the week.",2
2023-12-20,"more importantly, small-caps exploded higher as many of the magnificent seven stocks failed to keep up. instead of nvda hogging the headlines, we watched smaller names and forgotten growth stocks plow higher in dramatic fashion. the russell 2000 rallied a staggering 3.5% on fed day. and it didn't stop there. by the end of the week, the small-cap index rallied 5.5% to post its fifth green week in a row. this is the same index that was breaking to lows not seen since late 2020 during the final week of october. seven weeks later, the russell 2000 is now working on a significant breakout. one more important note: the russell 2000 has grossly underperformed the major averages for nearly two years. while the biggest of the big remained stable presences in the market, the russell was hit hard by the regional banking crisis earlier this year, and failed to rally with the major averages into the summer months. it also experienced a hard reset from august through october that led to a drop of more than 17%. most mega-caps were stable during this period while smaller names took a beating, acting as a de facto safe haven for investors worried about the potential for a bigger drawdown heading into the fourth quarter. but as more investors piled onto the bearish side of the boat, the market suddenly shot higher. the russell 2000 abruptly reversed off its lows, and a powerful melt-up move emerged.",2
2023-12-20,"despite its incredible 20%-plus rally that began at the start of november, the russell 2000 is just now attacking the top of its range. a breakout above 200 in iwm would be huge – and would set the stage for a catch-up move that could lead to small-caps quickly outperforming the big boys during the first half of 2024. you don't need to employ any complicated strategies to take advantage of a small-cap snapback. simply snag a few shares of the ishares russell 2000 etf (iwm) and you have an excellent chance to double the performance of the s&p 500 during the first half of 2024.",2

""president biden's political standing is at its weakest point of his presidency,"" says the wall street journal, reporting a new survey... ""...with voters giving him his lowest job-performance marks and favoring donald trump 47% to 43% in a head-to-head test of the likely 2024 presidential matchup."" given our focus here at bullionvault, what might trump's second coming do to the gold price? ""if trump is perceived to have an improved probability of winning the presidential race, that is likely to be supportive of gold prices,"" says one analyst... ...blah-blahing to the news-wires back in september 2016, two months before the donald's first win for the republican party. come that november, gold prices ""surged higher in light of a possible trump victory"" because ""risk aversion has risen noticeably"" said a swiss refiner and a german bank in their client notes as the 2016 election drew near. then, the day before the result, ""it looks like the market is [now] overwhelmingly pricing in a [democrat] clinton victory,"" said another analyst, ""weighing on gold prices"". oh yeah?",0
2023-12-18,"gold leapt on the day of trump's victory in november 2016... ...adding $75 per ounce as the result became clear. ""[this echoes the uk's] brexit referendum at the end of june,"" said yet another pundit, ""when gold surged by nearly 10% within just a few days after the vote."" but bigger picture, that jump was a feint, a fake-out, a mere spike within gold's then-ongoing downwards trading trend. and even though trump was going to prove dreadful for america and for the entire world according to pretty much every financial expert and political pundit, the price of gold in fact sank $200 from that top over the following 2 weeks... ...while the us stock market kick-started a 2-year run of new all-time highs. poor old gold wouldn't top its 2016 high until mid-2019. by then, the s&p500 index had risen by more than 36% from the day of trump's victory. so if we're going to get a repeat at the 2024 election, is now the time to cut gold, buy stocks? us customers of bullionvault certainly eased off gold during trump's first term, with the number of buyers down 10% in 2017-2019 compared to the prior 3 years as the number of sellers rose by that same percentage. north american gold etfs also saw less demand, almost halving the rate of growth in 2017-2018 compared with 2015-2016. but most dramatic by far was the reaction of us gold-coin buyers.",0
2023-12-18,"with a republican in the white house – the gold-loving donald trump, no less, if not the golden toilet artwork the guggenheim in new york offered him on loan – who needed to hoard and hide so much yellow, shiny stuff at home anymore? firearms also saw us sales sink during trump's first term. indeed, the maker of smith & wesson guns declared bankruptcy in 2019... ...thanks in part to the massive debts it got lumped with by a leveraged buy-out 10 years before... ...but also because, again, there was a republican in the white house. so there was little-to-zero risk of anyone restricting americans' right to bear arms. so there was less rush to stockpile guns and ammo for fear of the democrats trying to take them off you. covid flipped that trend in 2020, but the surge in smith & wesson's sales then accelerated a further 67% in 2021 after biden took over from trump. so will fear and insecurity ease back if trump wins the white house again? not according to the consensus financial view. ""if you think trump 1.0 was wild, wait 'til you see trump 2.0,"" said a macro-economist i heard speak at a seminar here in london earlier this month. by his own account, trump will up-end the west's support for ukraine, effectively gifting victory to russia. he will up-end world trade too, by imposing us import tariffs on stuff from everywhere – 100% of goods – rather than 'only' on the 30% which comes from china. that scenario does not, by itself, mean gold or the other precious metals would rise.",0
2023-12-18,"and while geopolitical tensions, plus us tariffs hitting international trade, don't sound good for western stock markets, that's what pretty much everyone thought of trump's tactics the first time around. what if he doesn't get to run? what if trump is blocked by the multiple fraud cases he's now fighting over his personal business affairs, or jailed outright for stoking the january 6th storming of the capitol in 2021? ""there will be riots, the country will burn,"" reckons former fox new anchor and republican media favourite megyn kelly. or put another way... ""things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; ""mere anarchy is loosed upon the world..."" this poem, w.b.yeats' 'the second coming', was quoted by irish economist david mcwilliams at the lbma annual conference this october. yeats' gloom seemed very apt given the horrors in israel, the misery in gaza, the continued suffering and slaughter in ukraine, and the risk of worsening conflict and political deaths worldwide in 2024.",0
2023-12-18,"but then 'the second coming' – written in 1919 as the horrors of ww1 were followed by the deadly 'spanish flu' pandemic – also seemed very apt when mcwilliams quoted it to discuss the social and economic impact of covid back in 2020... ...and it seemed all-too apt 4 years before that, when the possibility of trump becoming us president for the first time sent journalists, pundits and analysts rushing to find something scary to say about it. ""yeats' poem experienced a huge revival in 2016,"" says literary critic michiko kakutani's book the death of truth, lamenting trump (as well as brexit, populism and pretty much everything else) a couple of years later, midway through his first term. ""it was quoted in news articles more in the first half of that year than it had been in three decades."" here on the cusp of 2024, we already know what kind of ""rough beast"" might be ""slouching"" towards the white house for a second time next year. and while we might want to question the consensus view that trump will prove simply terrible for the economy, we should most likely expect a new revival for yeats' gloomy old verse as a result.

2023-12-17,"can milei really close argentina's central bank? article:post-socialist president pushes ahead... the monumental fiscal and monetary hole that peronists massa and fernández have left for javier milei is difficult to replicate, writes ie business school in madrid professor daniel lacalle in this article first published in english at mises.org and reposted by the cobden centre. ex-president mauricio macri himself explained that the inheritance milei receives is ""worse"" than the one he found from cristina fernández de kirchner. peronism leaves a country in ruins and with a massive time bomb for the next administration. the enormous economic problems of argentina start with a primary fiscal deficit of 3% of gdp and a total deficit (including interest expenses) exceeding 5% of gdp. moreover, it is a structural deficit that cannot be reduced unless public spending is slashed. public expenditure already accounts for 40% of gdp and has doubled in the era of kirchnerism. if we analyze argentina's budget, up to 20% is purely political spending. the previous left-wing administration only cut spending on pensions, which were half of the adjustment in real terms, according to the argentine institute of fiscal analysis.",1
2023-12-17,"massa and fernández's interventionist policies and price controls have left a shortage of meat and gasoline in a country rich in oil and livestock, demonstrating again what milton friedman said: ""will we read next that government control of prices has created a shortage of sand in the sahara?"" we must not forget that the fernandez administration leaves argentina with an annual inflation rate of 140% following an insane increase in the monetary base of more than 485% in five years, according to the central bank of argentina. this confiscatory and extractive fiscal and monetary policies have created a disaster in the central bank reserves. fernandez leaves a bankrupt central bank with negative net reserves of $12 billion and a time bomb in remunerated liabilities (leliqs) that exceed 12% of gdp and effectively mean more money printing and inflation in the future, when they mature. with a country risk of 2,400 basis points, the self-proclaimed ""socialism of the 21st century"" government has left argentina and its central bank officially bankrupt, with 40% of the population in poverty and with a failed currency. milei must now confront this poisoned legacy with determination and courage. macri, who suffered from the error of gradualism, recently argued that there was no room for mild measures, and he is right. milei has promised to shut down the central bank and dollarize the economy. however, can it be accomplished? the answer is yes. absolutely.",1
2023-12-17,"to understand why argentina must dollarize, the reader must know that the peso is a failed currency that even argentine citizens reject. most argentine citizens already save what they can in us dollars and conduct all major transactions in the us currency, because they know that their local currency will be dissolved by government interventionism. the government has 15 different exchange rates for the peso, all fake of course, all of which have only one objective: to steal from citizens their us dollars at a fake exchange rate. the central bank is bankrupt, with negative net reserves, and the peso is a failed currency. therefore, shutting down the central bank is essential, and the country needs to have an independent regulator without the power to print currency and monetize all the fiscal deficit, and it must eliminate the possibility of issuing the insane leliq (remunerated debt) that destroys the currency today and in the future. shutting down the central bank requires an immediate and strong solution to the leliqs, which will have to include a realistic approach to the monetary mismatch in a country where the ""official exchange rate"" is half the real market rate against the us dollar. taking a bold step to recognize this monetary mismatch, closing the central bank, and ending the monetization of debt are three essential steps to end a path to the destruction of a country comparable to that of venezuela.",1
2023-12-17,"milei understands this and knows that the us dollars that citizens save with enormous difficulty should flow back to the domestic economy by recognizing the monetary reality of the country making the us dollar a legal tender for all transactions. the monetary issue is one side of a hugely problematic coin. the fiscal problem needs to be addressed. milei needs to put an end to the bloated fiscal deficit, and that requires an adjustment that eliminates political spending without destroying pensions. this must involve selling some of the many inefficient and bloated public companies and the excess spending in purely political subsidies. secondly, milei must put an end to the ridiculous trade deficit. argentina must slash the misguided protectionist and interventionist laws if the peronists are open to the world to export all they can. to do this, it needs to put an end to the ridiculous ""currency exchange rate clamp"" and the 15 false exchange rates that the government uses to expropriate dollars from citizens and exporters with unfair rates and confiscations. taxes need to be lowered in a country that has 165 taxes and the highest tax wedge in the region, where small and medium-sized enterprises pay up to 100% of their sales. argentina must change what is currently a confiscatory and predatory state. additionally, bureaucratic barriers, protectionist measures, and political subsidies must be removed.",1
2023-12-17,"furthermore, milei must ensure legal certainty and an attractive and reliable regulatory framework where the ghost of expropriation and institutional theft does not return. milei's challenges are many, and the opposition will try to sabotage all market-friendly reforms because many politicians in argentina became very powerful and rich turning the country into a new venezuela. if argentina wants to become a thriving economy that returns to prosperity, it needs a stable macroeconomic and monetary system. it must recognize it has a failed currency and a bankrupt central bank and implement the urgent measures required as quickly as possible. it will be difficult but not impossible, and the potential of the economy is enormous. argentina was a rich country made poor by socialism. it needs to abandon socialism to become rich again.",1

""i'm really sorry about this,"" mr.o'neill replied, as the raf pilot continued to coax him down. at low level, mr.o'neill repeated that he was still flying blind.

2023-12-14,"his may be an abstract observation, but it has the commendable merit of being true.. all economic activity requires the cooperation of strangers and therefore, a degree of trust between cooperating strangers. since money is the agent of such mutual trust, debasing money implies debasing the trust upon which social cohesion rests. ""so i keep wondering to myself,"" says grice, ""do our money-printing central banks and their cheerleaders understand the full consequences of the monetary debasement they continue to engineer? inflation of the cpi might be a consequence both seen and measurable. a broad inflation of asset prices might be a consequence seen, though not measurable. but what about the consequences that are unseen but unmeasurable – and are all the more destructive for it? i feel queasy about the enthusiasm with which our wise economists play games with something about which we have such a poor understanding.."" the global financial crisis of 2007/8 showed that commercial banks cannot be trusted. that almost none of their employees went to jail showed that our political class and all its attendant lobbyists cannot be trusted. the ridiculous 'basil fawlty-ish' lengths to which our monetary authorities stretched themselves in the aftermath of the crisis show that central banks cannot be trusted.",1

2023-12-13,"critical tax case of moore vs. us article:unrealized gains are one thing, unpaid income quite another... the 16th amendment to the us constitution created the federal income tax, says jim rickards at the daily reckoning. it was ratified in 1913 and says, ""the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" this permitted the us to collect income taxes from individuals based on their individual incomes. prior to the 16th amendment, congress relied mostly on tariffs and excise taxes. some income taxes were passed by congress, but the supreme court struck them down on the view that direct taxes on wages, dividends, interest, rents, etc. had to be apportioned among the states based on population. the 16th amendment, in effect, overruled the supreme court and allowed the direct income taxes we have today. still, that begs the question: what is income? it has long been the case that income must be realized before it can be taxed. a paycheck or dividend distribution is certainly realized. but what about stock gains? if you buy a share of nvidia at $10 and it goes to $500, do you have to pay tax on that gain? the answer is no, unless you sell it. if you buy and hold, no gain has been realized and no tax is due. once you sell it for $500, you have to pay tax on the $490 gain. so far, so good. it's really pretty simple.",1
2023-12-13,"but over the past 100 years, congress, the treasury and the irs have created hundreds of exceptions to the realization requirement. for example, if you own stock in a private company and you transfer the shares to an offshore company that you also own, there is no realization. you did not get any cash or other property on the transfer. still, the irs says there is a ""deemed"" realization and some tax is due. this is designed to prevent citizens from later selling the stock offshore outside the us taxing jurisdiction. other examples include partnership taxation where a withdrawing partner may be deemed to have income on the unrealized value of partnership assets even though she received no cash. it gets more complicated from there, but you get the idea. of course, the biden administration is keen to tax unrealized gains. and just recently, 15 senators introduced wealth tax legislation intended to tax unrealized gains. now, a married couple has challenged the entire system of ""deemed"" realization and says that there is no income unless the asset is actually sold or exchanged for cash or other property. they claim they're being taxed on earnings that hadn't yet been distributed to them by a foreign corporation. they're arguing that taxing these unreceived earnings is unconstitutional. here's some background. i'm not going to get too deeply into the weeds here, but it helps to know a bit about the case. in 2006, the couple invested $40,000 in a foreign corporation.",1
2023-12-13,"between 2006 and 2017, the company reinvested all its earnings in the business. so the couple didn't receive any dividend payments or other income. but the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 provided a new federal tax called the ""mandatory repatriation tax"" that applied to investors in overseas corporations. this new tax treated investors' share of a corporation's undistributed earnings like they were actually distributed to the shareholders. to the surprise of many, the us supreme court has taken up the case and is hearing oral arguments. the attorney representing the taxpayers argued, ""'income' was understood at the time of the 16th amendment's adoption to refer to gains coming into the taxpayer, like wages, rents and dividends. appreciation in the value of a home, a stock investment or other property is not and never has been taxed as income."" he went on to say, ""that's not how the income tax has ever worked going back to 1913. again, the reason the law doesn't work that way is the obvious one. unrealized gains are not income. the only way to make sense of the income tax as it's existed for a century is to stick with the original meaning of the 16th amendment. the court should reaffirm that there is no income without realization."" meanwhile, the attorney representing the government argued that the 16th amendment doesn't actually require that income must be realized before it can be taxed.",1
2023-12-13,"she said the 16th amendment doesn't explicitly mention realization, and that ""income"" has a broader meaning than only gains that have been realized. she also argued that congress has the legitimate authority to tax unrealized gains under its broad authority to regulate commerce. if the supreme court rules for the government and finds that income tax doesn't require realized income, it could pave the way for a federal wealth tax that democrats are pushing for. but if the court rules in favor of the taxpayers, this could blow a big hole in the us budget as the revenue currently collected by the irs on deemed sales is lost.",1

2023-12-08,"the fact that the money supply is shrinking at all is remarkable because the money supply in modern times almost never gets smaller. the money supply has now fallen by $2.8 trillion (or 13.1%) since the peak in april 2022. proportionally, the drop in money supply since 2022 is the largest fall we've seen since the depression. (rothbard estimates that in the lead-up to the great depression, the money supply fell by 12% from its peak of $73 billion in mid-1929 to $64 billion at the end of 1932.) in spite of this recent drop in total money supply, the trend in money-supply remains well above what existed during the twenty-year period from 1989 to 2009. to return to this trend, the money supply would have to drop at least another $3 trillion or so – or 15% – down to a total below $15 trillion. moreover, as of october, total money supply was still up 32% (or $4.6 trillion) since january 2020. since 2009, the tms money supply is now up by nearly 186%. (m2 has grown by 141% in that period.) out of the current money supply of $18.9 trillion, $4.6 trillion – or 24% – of that has been created since january 2020. since 2009, $12.2 trillion of the current money supply has been created. in other words, nearly two-thirds of the total existing money supply have been created just in the past thirteen years. with these kinds of totals, a ten-percent drop only puts a small dent in the huge edifice of newly created money.",0

(the technical name for this is dvo1 for ""dollar value of one basis point"". you don't need to be expert on this; it's just useful to understand the concept). put differently, if interest rates drop from 7.0% to 6.5%, notes have a capital gain. if rates drop from 4.0% to 3.5%, they also have a capital gain. in both cases, the rate drop is 0.50%. but the capital gain in the second case is materially larger than in the first case. right now, we're in that zone where rates are low and going lower, which means the capital gains are getting larger. that's a big win for investors on a security with almost no credit risk. what accounts for the rally in gold prices? there are numerous factors that affect the gold price, but certain factors dominate at certain times. right now, the key factor is interest rates. rates are going down at a rapid pace and gold is going up in a kind of synchronicity. why? the simplest explanation for the correlation is that treasury notes and gold are both high-quality assets that compete for investor allocations. gold does not have a yield (although it can produce significant capital gains). when yields on treasuries drop, the zero yield on gold is relatively more attractive compared with the note yield and gold prices start to rally. the key questions for investors are: will rates continue to drop?",0
2023-12-07,"and will gold continue to rally in sync with falling rates? to forecast rates, we have to look at economic fundamentals. (by the way, the federal reserve is almost irrelevant for this purpose. the fed controls the short end of the yield curve only and has almost no impact on longer-term rates including the 10-year treasury note rate we are considering here.) one conundrum of recent us economic performance is that gdp has remained robust while signs of a recession and possible a financial crisis keep accumulating. us gdp was 2.2% in the first quarter of 2023, 2.1% in the second quarter and a strong 4.9% in the third quarter. the best estimate for fourth-quarter growth from the atlanta fed is currently 1.2%, a substantial drop from the third quarter. if that q4 figure holds, growth for the entire year of 2023 will come in around 2.5%. that's not too shabby, and it's slightly better than the 2.2% average annual growth from 2009-2019 in the 10-year period between the global financial crisis and the pandemic. in any case, it's a far cry from a recession. still, a focus on full-year growth of around 2.5% ignores the trend. when growth goes from 4.9% in the third quarter to 1.2% in the fourth quarter, something extreme happened. it's almost certainly the case that consumers slammed on the brakes in october. recession signs are real and growing worse.",0
2023-12-07,"these include credit contraction, rising bad debts, increasing jobless claims, collapsing commercial real estate markets, contracting world trade, inverted yield curves and many other reliable technical indicators. how can the economy be headed into recession after such strong growth recently? the riddle is solved by the fact that the economy has been propped up by the consumer. that explains the growth. but the consumer has been on a non-sustainable path. that explains the warning signs. the consumer came out of the pandemic with a head of steam provided by handouts from trump ($1800 per adult), and biden (also about $1400 per adult) between april 2020 and march 2021. that was supplemented by $900 billion of paycheck protection program loans, which were forgiven one year later. student loan payments were suspended from 2020-2023. the federal reserve held interest rates at zero from 2020-2022. then the misnamed inflation reduction act of august 2022 handed $1 trillion of taxpayer money to green new scam businesses and other pet projects. with that money, americans were able to pay down credit card balances and build up savings. it was a powerful double-dose of fiscal and monetary stimulus. much of this operates with a lag so the growth momentum carried over into 2023. now it's all gone. short-term interest rates are over 5%. mortgage rates are over 7%. student loan repayments have started again. there are no more pandemic handouts.",0
2023-12-07,"americans' savings are depleted, and their credit cards are tapped out. now the reckoning begins. in fact, the recession may already be here. interest rates do not typically peak at the start of a recession; they peak somewhat after the recession begins. businesses see revenues decline and turn to lines of credit to help with cash flow. only later, when unemployment goes up and credit losses accumulate, do banks rein in credit and then interest rates start to decline. we may already be at that stage. the fact that interest rates are already in sharp decline suggests the recession has already begun. the importance of this for investors is that interest rate declines have much further to go (probably down to the level of 2% or lower over the next six months), which means gold prices have further to rise (perhaps to the $2300 per ounce level or higher). with both trends in place and a positive feedback loop between them, this is a once-in-a-decade opportunity for investors. it really doesn't get much better than that!",0
2023-12-06,"depression economics article:revisiting the great depression with murray rothbard... sometimes, albeit very occasionally, you come across a book that utterly changes the way you look at the world, writes tim price at price value partners. one such book: murray rothbard's extraordinarily thought-provoking ""america's great depression"" (the ludwig von mises institute, fifth edition, 2008). rothbard, who died in january 1995, was something of a 'renaissance man': scholar, economist, historian and philosopher. he was also a leading member of what has come to be known as the austrian school of economics – which amongst other things maintains a healthy cynicism about the value of mathematical modelling in markets, and which puts a premium on 'sound money' over more speculative and ultimately dangerous credit creation. not least in its suspicion of the role of banks, it is the perfect read for our time. if your schooling was anything like ours, ""america's great depression"" will turn on its head your opinion of the economic catastrophe of the 1930s – a period whose echoes resound throughout the global financial crisis that began in 2007 and which has yet to be resolved, if the share prices of the major us banks, for example, are any guide. in essence, the message we received at school was that herbert hoover oversaw a stupendous crash in the us stock market; the economy entered a profound slump; and it was only the interventionist vigour of president franklin d.",2
2023-12-06,"roosevelt which pulled it back out. but rothbard's conclusions are diametrically opposed. president hoover, by rothbard's account, threw all kinds of government resources at the problem, long before roosevelt's own alphabet soup of state agencies. rothbard's thoughts about the banking system, in particular, and about the role of government in addressing booms and busts, have enormous relevance for today's investment markets. rothbard's death in 1995 meant that he was unable to share with us his views about the orgy of credit provision and the unrestrained mortgage lending that in large part triggered the global banking crisis. let's not even mention the economic insanity that accompanied covid, most notoriously lockdowns. but it is unlikely that he would have approved. and he had extremely strong opinions about the very nature of fractional reserve banking: the system by which banks keep a tiny fraction of their deposits in order to lend out the remainder for profit. as he comments in this masterful work: ""banks are ""inherently bankrupt"" because they issue far more warehouse receipts to cash (nowadays in the form of ""deposits"" redeemable in cash on demand) than they have cash available. hence, they are always vulnerable to bank runs.",2
2023-12-06,"these runs are not like any other business failures, because they simply consist of depositors claiming their own rightful property, which the banks do not have. ""inherent bankruptcy,"" then, is an essential feature of any fractional reserve banking system."" rothbard goes on to quote frank d. graham from ""partial reserve money and the 100% proposal"" (american economic review, september 1936): ""the attempt of the banks to realize the inconsistent aims of lending cash, or merely multiplied claims to cash, and still to represent that cash is available on demand is even more preposterous than.. eating one's cake and counting on it for future consumption.. the alleged convertibility is a delusion dependent upon the right's not being unduly exercised."" suffice to say that rothbard, and members of the austrian school, hold to the primacy of gold as a fundamental store of value that restricts the animal spirits of bankers to indulge in uncontrolled credit creation. as rothbard sees it, the business cycle is straightforward. bank credit expansion causes an inflationary boom, which is marked by an expansion in the money supply and by what he calls malinvestment, both by bankers and entrepreneurs. the crisis comes about when credit expansion halts abruptly and those malinvestments become all too evident.",2
2023-12-06,"what he then calls the ""depression recovery"" starts the necessary adjustment process ""by which the economy returns to the most efficient ways of satisfying consumer desires."" note that rothbard conjoins ""depression"" and ""recovery"": they are one and the same thing. you cannot have economic recovery without a cleansing depression: ""wasteful projects.. must either be abandoned or used as best they can be. inefficient firms, buoyed up by the artificial boom, must be liquidated or have their debts scaled down or be turned over to their creditors. prices of producers' goods must fall, particularly in the higher orders of production – this includes capital goods, lands, and wage rates.. not only prices of particular machines must fall, but also the prices of whole aggregates of capital, e.g. stock market and real estate values. in fact, these values must fall more than the earnings from the assets.."" ""liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate."" this notorious quote from us treasury andrew mellon after the crash once struck us as grotesque, unfeeling, and overly simplistic. now, having read rothbard, we are not so sure. mellon suggested that the economic severity of the depression would ""purge the rottenness out of the system."" this sounds like painful medicine, which of course it is.",2
2023-12-06,"but as the scale of government support for the banking system in our own time continues to swell monstrously, one might well ask whether the presumed interventionist cure is worse than the disease. rothbard, as a classic free marketeer, indicates that the economic contraction process causes no positive malinvestments (unlike the boom that preceded it), so it will not lead to such a painful period of depression and adjustment. ""if businessmen are misled into thinking that less capital is available for investment than is really the case, no lasting damage in the form of wasted investments will ensue."" where the rothbard thesis is most striking, however, is in relation to the role of government. his first and clearest injunction to return the economy to ""normal"" prosperity: don't interfere with the market's adjustment process; ""the more the government intervenes to delay the market's adjustment, the longer and more gruelling the depression will be, and the more difficult will be the road to complete recovery. government hampering aggravates and perpetuates the depression. yet, government depression policy has always (and would have even more today) aggravated the very evils it has loudly tried to cure."" rothbard goes on to list the various ways that government might hamper this market adjustment process. ironically, the list also and exactly constitutes the preferred ""anti-depression"" measures of government policy!",2
2023-12-06,"the list of flawed palliatives runs as follows: prevent or delay liquidation. lend money to shaky businesses, call on banks to lend further, etc. inflate further. further inflation blocks the necessary fall in prices, thus delaying adjustment and prolonging depression. keep wage rates up. artificial maintenance of wage rates in a depression ensures permanent mass unemployment. keep prices up. keeping prices above their free market levels will create unsaleable surpluses, and prevent a return to prosperity. stimulate consumption and discourage saving. any increase in the relative size of government in the economy shifts the societal consumption-investment ratio in favour of consumption, and prolongs the depression. subsidize unemployment. any subsidisation of unemployment will prolong unemployment indefinitely, and delay the shift of workers to the fields where jobs are available. what is striking today is how many of these measures are being actively pursued by the governments of developed economies, not least our own. rothbard concludes his study of the great depression by pointing out just how extensive the hoover administration measures were in an ultimately vain attempt to combat the slump. ""for the first time, laissez-faire was boldly thrown overboard and every governmental weapon thrown into the breach..",2
2023-12-06,"by every ""progressive"" tenet of our day, he should have ended his term a conquering hero; instead he left america in utter and complete ruin – a ruin unprecedented in length and intensity."" why did this come about? rothbard holds, perhaps controversially, that only governmental inflation can generate a true boom and bust cycle, and that any depression will be prolonged and intensified by inflationist intervention on the part of presumably well-meaning politicians. ""america's great depression"" showcases rothbard's firm belief that president hoover's aggressive interventionist measures ended up aggravating the economic slowdown. in his words, ""the guilt for the great depression must, at long last, be lifted from the shoulders of the free-market economy, and placed where it properly belongs: at the doors of politicians, bureaucrats and the mass of ""enlightened"" economists. and in any other depression, past or future, the story will be the same."" governments and their central banks, in other words, are the primary causes of recessions and depressions – and of wild inflations. unsound fiat must ultimately be replaced by sound money. the prices of gold and silver would now appear to be reaching exactly the same conclusion.",2
2023-12-05,"profit taking in gold slows at record-high prices article:still fewest gold buyers in 4 years, 13 for silver... record-high gold prices have seen private investors as a group sell more of the precious metal than they're buying yet again, writes adrian ash at world-leading marketplace bullionvault. but unlike in silver – where the recent jump in prices spurred heavier selling among existing investors – the pace of profit taking in gold has slowed as financial and geopolitical risks continue to build ahead of new year 2024. indeed, with gold prices setting new all-time records as cash in the bank offers the highest rate of interest since before the 2008 financial crash, the real surprise in physical bullion is that profit-taking hasn't been greater. gold selling remains marginal compared with the buy-and-hold approach adopted by the vast majority of private investors. that strategy, coupled with record-heavy central bank gold demand led by china, suggests that the rising floor beneath gold prices continues to strengthen as investors look ahead to 2024 and see a growing risk of recession, ongoing war in ukraine if not worsening conflict in the middle east, plus divisive elections in the us, india and the uk. even so, november saw the number of people buying gold on bullionvault drop 15.6% from october's rebound to hit a fresh 4-year low as the price rose $40 per troy ounce to finish at a new month-end high of $2035.",0
2023-12-05,"the number of sellers fell harder than buyers however, down 36.8% from october's 7-month high. together that pulled the gold investor index – a unique measure of investor behaviour in the gold bullion market – up to 51.9. any reading above 50.0 indicates more buyers and sellers. the gold investor index set a decade low of 49.1 in june 2019 as the precious metal's price jumped at what was then the fastest pace in over 3 years, and it set a decade high of 65.9 as the covid pandemic went global in march 2020. compared to that peak, the latest reading is clearly weak. more dramatically, last month's rise of just 1.1 points from october's 9-month low was the index's strongest increase since june, and the fourth strongest of the last 12 months. a gold rush this ain't, in other words. and the svb mini-crisis aside, it hasn't been all year. and while november saw investor selling in gold ease back despite the price rising further, this monday's big price spike proved it's too early to say that profit-taking is close to exhausted. because bullionvault is open 24/7, unlike coin shops or stock market-listed gold etf products, yesterday morning's 3.5% surge in gold prices at the start of asian trade saw sellers jump to take advantage, outnumbering buyers and with the quantity sold outweighing demand by almost three-quarters.",0
2023-12-05,"that extended the pattern of the last 3 months – the longest such stretch since mid-2019 – with bullionvault users selling a quarter-tonne of gold more than they bought as a group across november. but note: that was barely half the quantity of net gold selling in october, and while last month's liquidation took total client holdings down 2.1% from end-august's record high to the smallest in 20 months at 47.2 tonnes, it still saw the value of bullionvault users' gold rise 1.4% to a new record dollar value of $3.1 billion. silver in contrast saw profit-taking accelerate in november as the dollar price jumped by 7.8%, reaching the heaviest since april. bullionvault users sold 14.5 tonnes more than they bought as a group, cutting their total holdings by 1.1% to 1,229.1 tonnes, the smallest in 19 months and 3.0% below the record high of october 2022. but here again, as in gold, the value of those silver holdings still grew, rising 6.6% across november to $988 million, the highest in 7 months. by number, however, silver's big price jump in november – putting it above $25 per troy ounce at the end of the month for the first time since july 2021 – really whacked the balance of buyers and sellers. the number of investors choosing to buy the precious metal fell 45.9% from october, sinking to the fewest since august 2010. the number of silver sellers in contrast jumped by 57.3% to the most in 7 months.",0
2023-12-05,"together that pulled the silver investor index down by 5.2 points, the steepest drop since october 2020, and it put the index at a new series low of 46.4. bottom line? whether fast, high or both, rising prices for gold and silver continue to meet profit-taking rather than any kind of rush to buy. but that selling remains marginal, and across november it lagged the rise in prices, putting bullionvault users' total precious metals holdings at a new all-time high of $4.1 billion. so it pays to take profit, short term. but it also keeps paying to buy and hold, too.",0
2023-11-30,"gold, silver and 2024 fed rate cut forecasts article:rate cuts coming says everyone. but how deep...? not even december yet, but a cold christmas has already hit britain's tv ads and half-empty shopping malls, writes adrian ash at bullionvault. finance analysts are rushing even further ahead... ...issuing their 2024 predictions while the old year still has 5 weeks to go. the 'big call' consensus? everyone says next year will bring lower interest rates, starting with rate cuts from us central bank the federal reserve. cheap money would of course prove wonderful for bonds, stocks, real estate speculators, no doubt crypto bros and (most likely) precious metals led by gold and silver. so how much lower will us rates go? that's where opinion splits. us investment bank goldman sachs is the least excited about fed rate cuts for 2024, predicting only 1 small cut before the end of next year. that's because goldman believes that, while ""the hard part of the inflation fight now looks over"", the us central bank has ""made substantial progress toward a soft landing..."" ...and so it sees little chance of an economic recession, caused by the fed's rate hikes, needing a steep cut to rates next year. at the other end of the range, swiss-based bank ubs says that fed rates will end 2024 way down at 2.75%, pretty much halving from where they stand today.",0
2023-11-30,"their logic? ""the starting conditions are much worse now than 12 months ago,"" ubs is quoted by cnbc, pointing to the ""historically large amount of credit that is being withdrawn from the us economy"" as lenders stop lending so much and the fed itself continues to wind down its massive qe bond purchases from the covid pandemic and, before that, the global financial crisis. on an annual basis, the fed has now shrunk its balance-sheet by almost 10% from november 2022, very nearly matching the record pace of sucking money out of banks it hit in summer 2019, back when it last lost its bottle and stopped reducing its qe bond holdings as the financial markets decided that a us recession was looming. the markets proved right of course, but more out of luck than foresight. i mean, no-one said in 2019 that a global pandemic would shut the world economy in 2020. that recession then marked the deepest plunge in economic activity on modern records. and yet the us fed, in response, slashed its key interest rate by only 2.3 percentage points, less than ubs is now forecasting for 2024. does anyone really think next year will be worse than covid? no, at a guess (and a prayer). but it doesn't need to be. the fed could easily cut rates deeper and faster next year than it did from 2019 to 2020, because it's starting from a much higher point. check the chart above. it shows, in blue, how the fed funds rate is currently at its highest since early 2001, way up at 5.33% per annum.",0
2023-11-30,"whereas in 2019, and after trying to ""normalize"" interest rates following the global financial crisis, the fed's baby-step rate rises only got up to 2.40% before it began cutting rates again. the fed then refused to go below zero (unlike the bank of japan or swiss national bank or european central bank). so the most it could cut by when the 2019 recession scare became the 2020 covid catastrophe was also 2.40%. this contrasts with the tech stock crash of 2001, when fed rates started at 6.50% and fell by 4.60% in 12 months... ...and it also contrasts with the panic phase of the global financial crisis in 2008, when fed rates started at 5.26% and fell by 4.10% in 12 months. put another way, the recession forecast from ubs looks a lot more like the ""soft landing"" forecast from goldman sachs than the gap between their interest-rate forecasts would suggest at first glance. indeed, and putting the 2020 covid recession aside (because the fed's rate-cutting was limited by its low starting point and its very anglo-saxon commitment to the 'zero lower bound') only 1 of the previous 7 recessions in the us saw the fed cut rates by less than ubs' forecast for 2024.",0
2023-11-30,"that shallow cut to fed rates came around the 1980 recession, brought about by the fed yanking rates up above double-digits as it finally grasped the nettle of tackling double-digit inflation. ""letting gold go to $850 per ounce was a mistake,"" said famously tall and infamously high-rate fed chair paul volcker of that frantic time, when gold peaked 24 times above its price of a decade earlier. ""we had to deal with inflation. there was a kind of great speculative pressure...everybody wanted to buy collectibles...other markets of real things were booming."" lots of things are now booming again as everyone bets that jerome powell, head of the fed today, will start cutting rates next june if not may if not april or march. investors and speculators have already bid up the nasdaq 100 index of us tech stocks by more than 12% since the eve of the fed's ""no change"" decision at the start of november. they've sent silver prices over 12% higher against the falling us dollar over the last 2 weeks alone. for now, that jump in silver prices hasn't been followed by gold (now a mere 5.2% higher from a fortnight ago)... ...let alone by gold-mining stocks... ...and it's so far spurred a return to the kind of profit-taking by existing silver investors seen at the tail-end of 2022.",0
2023-11-30,"but powell has, in the past, been called a ""high rates guy""... ...albeit by donald trump, the deeply indebted real-estate mogul, who chose powell to chair the fed back in 2018 when he was in the white house and he wanted ""a low rates guy"" to keep juicing the economy and the stock market. most surely, jerome powell – at least compared to the rate of interest set by his more recent predecessors – really does seem to like keeping rates closer to inflation if not above it. that resolve may well get tested next year if this month's gently weakening us data starts to tumble. so too might america's financial support for the wars being fought by both ukraine and israel, never mind taiwan if beijing decides to chance its luck... ...as well as washington's own record peace-time budget deficits and its startling ability to keep the stock-market soaring... ...even before we get to the possibility of trump himself returning to the white house in next november's election. long-dated treasury bonds, after all, are now deemed a ""risky"" asset (a little too late to help unwary savers!) while 40% of small-cap us companies are now loss-making. all of this will matter to gold, silver and the other precious metals next year. bottom line for now? there ain't no crisis like a dollar crisis. and the dollar faces a whole raft of trouble ahead. more on this to follow. lots more no doubt in 2024.",0
2023-11-29,"copper, gold and the looming us deflation article:ratio says disinflation flipping to recession... i have not posted the monthly chart of the copper/gold ratio probably since last year, says gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. that's because 2023 has been all about disinflationary goldilocks recovery, rather than a deflationary liquidity crisis. however, as goldilocks matures into old age, it is worth keeping tabs on the original thesis, which is inflation > disinflationary goldilocks > deflation scare/liquidity crisis. i realize that everybody now knows that a recession is coming, which would argue against one coming any time soon. but the chart is the chart and it has been the chart for about 18 months. the chart, in this case, is a gauge of a counter-cyclical environment, and though the stock market has rallied on cue in 2023, and commodities – with the help of opec+ oil price manipulation – have rallied to a lesser degree, the counter-cyclical signal is not only still in place, it has become more pronounced. to many inflationists, commodity super-cyclers and supposed ""metals"" experts, there is little difference between the macro characteristics of gold and copper, because to understand and manage the differences requires difficult as opposed to easy to understand (by the herd) analysis.",0
2023-11-29,"but aside from illustrating the clownery of copper/commodity promoters who've remained steadfast bullish the whole while, the signal is right in line with the 2023 goldilocks 'disinflation' view and it is burrowing southward looking ahead to the next link in our chain, deflation and/or liquidity crisis. in the event this analysis expires in favor of an inflationary option sooner than currently expected, the copper/gold ratio (along with other indicators we use in nftrh) should give a signal well ahead of time. meanwhile, regardless of whether the stock market's goldilocks flavored rally continues on to test or even marginally exceed the 2021 high, the negative signal by copper/gold is intact and waiting.",0

2023-11-29,"our career path changed, in a way that we have no regrets about whatever. indirectly, it led us to where we are today, as partner in our own company, and to financial freedom we would probably never have achieved as just another employee of a wall street firm. admittedly, from the vantage point of 2023, some of cluetrain's philosophy comes across as uncontrollably free-spirited, not to say hippyish ('the wall street journal' called it ""the pretentious, strident and absolutely brilliant creation of four marketing gurus who have renounced marketing-as-usual""), but cluetrain always struck us as a new economy battle cry years ahead of its time. we are living through the end of business-as-usual; the internet really does change everything. but these guys were saying it over 20 years ago, when profits or even revenues were beyond most web businesses altogether. as for us, back in 1999, as both an employee and a stockholder of merrill lynch, this correspondent had begun to notice the ground shifting beneath his feet. we had not ignored the fact that the full-service investment bank merrill lynch – with its army of 13,000 domestic brokers – had just seen its market capitalisation eclipsed by that of online discount brokerage charles schwab. in any event, we didn't need to be told the message of 'cluetrain' twice. by april 2000 we had left merrill lynch and set up our own business. others at the firm reacted differently; that is to say, with denial.",0
2023-11-29,"john 'launny' steffens, the vice-chairman of merrill lynch, warned in september 1998 that: ""the do-it-yourself model of investing, centred on internet trading, should be regarded as a serious threat to americans' financial lives."" but then he would, wouldn't he? meanwhile, the web and networked markets went on to dismantle or reinvent traditional businesses across the economic landscape. the music industry was an early scalp. napster may not have won, but big music largely lost, and had to change. who would have thought in 1999 that a pure technology company – apple – would end up being the dominant seller of music in the early years of the 21st century? first music, than traditional publishing. any business whose end product was at the mercy of digitisation was vulnerable to the digital economy. newspapers buckled under the threat from blogs, aggregators and google; booksellers and then all kinds of other retailers got crushed by the leviathan that is amazon. finance is now set grimly against the gale. there's a quotation that's attributed to bill gates of microsoft back in 1994: ""banking is necessary, but banks are not."" just pause to consider that. and then, around the turn of the millennium, josef ackermann, the ceo of deutsche bank, one of the largest banks in europe but now a basket case, commented that what he feared most was not his traditional competitors, but rather the rise of ""near-banks and non-banks"".",0
2023-11-29,"it took a little time, but those fears are already coming to pass. suffice to say, the authors of the cluetrain manifesto got there first. they wrote of a new economic paradigm, in which gigantic businesses scanned the horizon in search of competitors who looked like they did. there was just one problem. those businesses were utterly unaware of the legions of ant-like start-ups who were swarming at their feet, looking nothing like them, and content to compete for a tiny fraction of the giants' business. although each of them individually might not amount to much by way of competition, some of them might become huge, and collectively they would quite possibly sweep the old line players away. speaking of style bias, the us fund management firm research affiliates crunched the numbers on the entire us stock market for the 50 years from 1967 to 2016 by investment style and the results are shown below.",0
2023-11-29,"we can debate the specific characteristics of 'value', 'momentum', 'quality' and 'growth' stocks, but in essence they would look something like this: value stocks will typically trade on low valuation multiples (like price/earnings and price/book); momentum stocks will typically be trending strongly higher in price, irrespective of which sector they belong to; quality stocks will have robust and well recognised businesses and brands with global reach, with a history of strong and uninterrupted dividends; growth stocks will be displaying strong growth in revenues (if not necessarily profits or dividends) and will often be in the technology sector. the intriguing thing about the research affiliates data is that it pointed to some surprising conclusions, namely that on average, only 'value' and 'momentum' generated superior returns relative to the market over the longer term; 'quality' and 'growth' actually tended to destroy value relative to the market as a whole. we stress that these style labels are not beneficiaries of an exact science. it may also be the case that the history of the last decade or so – and the extraordinary outperformance of 'growth' over that period, especially relative to 'value' – might simply be a huge albeit persistent anomaly. or perhaps things really are different now. as somebody once said: value investors invest on the basis that nothing will change; whereas growth investors invest on the basis that everything will change.",0

2023-11-28,"make argentina great again article:maga goes 'anarcho-capitalism' amid 150% inflation... political outsider javier milei won argentina's presidential election last week, in a development that's shocked the world, says jim rickards in the daily reckoning. though his policy prescriptions are different than trump's in many respects, milei is basically the argentinian version of donald trump because of his anti-establishment, ""drain the swamp"" rhetoric. you can liken milei's election to trump's 2016 election and brexit. it's a popular rejection of globalism and the neoliberal global order. perhaps not coincidentally, argentina joined the brics nations in august, which will formally take effect in january. as i've written about extensively, the brics nations are challenging dollar hegemony and the western-dominated global financial system. milei has identified as an ""anarcho-capitalist"", which is essentially free market libertarianism taken to the extreme. that means the elimination of the state and privatization of all the state's functions. it's about as anti-establishment as you can get. needless to say, he wants to eliminate argentina's version of the fed. i wish him luck. he'll need it. let's just say he faces an uphill battle, like trump did after he was elected in 2016. that someone who identifies as an anarcho-capitalist can win an election in argentina is remarkable in itself (milei won in a 56%-44% landslide).",1
2023-11-28,"since the middle of the 20th century, argentina has been governed largely by left-wing politics. it's not exactly fertile soil for extreme libertarianism. but when your country's suffering economically and your annualized inflation rate is approaching 150%, you might want to throw the bums out and try something different. by the way, most people might not realize it but argentina was once a very wealthy nation. in fact, there was a saying that if someone was very wealthy, he was ""as rich as an argentine."" that phrase is obviously long out of date.",1
2023-11-27,"buffett's inflation-investment warning article:aka, beware the men in the white coats... some investment truths are eternal, says tim price at price value partners. here's one from warren buffett, one of the most successful investors in history: ""it is no longer a secret that stocks, like bonds, do poorly in an inflationary environment."" buffett wrote that in an essay from may 1977 cited above, 'how inflation swindles the equity investor'. history is about to repeat. after a more than decade-long bull run for the us stock market, mega-cap 'growth' stocks might seem invulnerable. the consensus is that they are the only game in town. there's a superficial logic to the equity story which rests heavily if not exclusively on recency bias. but it critically ignores one gigantic elephant in the room: the future path of interest rates. there is a clear warning from history. on 31 december, 1964, the dow jones industrial average stood at 874. on 31 december, 1981, it was 875. in buffett's words, ""i'm known as a long term investor and a patient guy, but that is not my idea of a big move."" in that 17-year period, the gdp of the us rose by 370% and fortune 500 company sales went up by a factor of six times. more than an entire decade for the us stock market was lost. why?",0
2023-11-27,"back to buffett, again. ""to understand why that happened, we need first to look at one of the two important variables that affect investment results: interest rates. ""these act on financial valuations the way gravity acts on matter: the higher the rate, the greater the downward pull. that's because the rates of return that investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the risk-free rate that they can earn from government securities. ""so if the government rate rises, the prices of all other investments must adjust downward, to a level that brings their expected rates of return into line... ""there...lies the major explanation of why tremendous growth in the economy was accompanied by a stock market going nowhere."" in one of his recent 'year in review' essays, cornell chemistry professor and economic agent provocateur david collum reminds us that: ""optimists bray that rising rates are bullish, a sign that the world economy is recovering. in 1999, however, buffett wrote a compelling article in fortune attributing secular equity moves to one and only one parameter – the direction of long-term interest rates. secular equity bull markets occur when long-term rates are dropping – not low but dropping – and secular bears occur when rates are rising. he didn't equivocate... ""so are rates really that low? in a word, yes...the salad days of the bond market are in our rear-view mirror. the rate bottom and subsequent rise will be global.",0
2023-11-27,"rising rates will spread into the markets and economy at large, causing concurrent stagnation, dropping price earnings ratios (from nosebleed case-shiller estimates of 24), collapse of credit-fuelled/capex-lite corporate profit margins, and crush under-funded pensions and municipalities rendering them less funded. if rates have nowhere to go but up, what direction are they headed?"" as we now know, the tide is going out for a trend that has supported higher bond prices for 40+ years. there's another reason we think it's time to be cautious on the last decade's secular 'growth' winners. call it, if you like, 'too much belief in authority'. check out craig zobel's 2012 thriller, 'compliance'. it makes for uncomfortable viewing. in the film, based on real events, a fast food restaurant receives a call from someone claiming to be a police officer. the manager is informed that a female staff member has stolen money from a customer's purse and must be detained. despite denying the crime the employee, a young girl, is held by her colleagues in the backroom. she protests her innocence to no avail. on the basis that she might be hiding the evidence, the ""police officer"" then instructs the manager to carry out a strip search. the film plays out as she and her gullible staff are manipulated by the caller through their desire to ""help the police"". in the end, the employees realise that they have been tricked into committing crimes themselves.",0
2023-11-27,"these are clearly actors playing their respective roles. but although the premise itself sounds ludicrous, it is convincingly staged. in fact, the events depicted in 'compliance' are not purely fictitious...instead they're based on 70 similar incidents that took place across north america. the film's message is that many of us automatically and even unthinkingly surrender to authority. it's not malice that makes the (innocent) girl's co-workers humiliate her. they do it because they think they're following the legitimate orders of a police officer. as to why that officer can't come to the restaurant: let's just say he is very persuasive. it was the poet coleridge who coined the phrase ""the willing suspension of disbelief"". if an artist can infuse his work with enough humanity – and the appearance of truth – we, the audience, will buy into the illusion. we'll put our scepticism on hold. that is the power of authority. we can't help but draw parallels with the investment world...where the most successful players never cease to question the received wisdom. 'compliance' follows two even more notorious us experiments in human psychology that are grimly relevant in our post-covid dystopia. the stanford prison experiment took place at stanford university, california, in august 1971. 24 male students were assigned roles as either prisoner or guard in a mock prison in the basement of the university's psychology department.",0
2023-11-27,"psychology professor philip zimbardo was setting out to test the hypothesis that the main cause of abuse in prisons was the psychological make-up of the prisoners and their wardens. the 'guards' were equipped with wooden batons and mirrored sunglasses to prevent direct eye contact. the 'prisoners' were arrested at their homes, fingerprinted, then had their mug shots taken. order lasted for precisely one day. on day two, prisoners in one cell blockaded the door and refused to follow the guards' instructions. then after 36 hours, one prisoner started to ""act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control."" when the experimenters realised he wasn't acting, he was released. guards soon resorted to physical punishment. sanitary conditions quickly deteriorated too, with guards refusing to allow prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but a bucket in their cell. some prisoners had their mattresses removed; others were stripped naked as punishment. the experiment then spiralled into more abuse, hunger strikes, and solitary confinement. after just six days, it was abandoned. one third of the guards were determined to have displayed ""genuine sadistic tendencies"". many of the prisoners were traumatised. such is the malign power of authority. equally notorious was the series of experiments run by yale psychologist stanley milgram in 1961. you may have seen video footage of the original milgram tests, or recreations of them. each involved three participants.",0
2023-11-27,"two of them – the one coordinating the experiment, and the so-called 'learner', were ""in"" on the experiment. the third, the supposed 'teacher', was the unwitting subject of it. so, the teacher began by reading a list of word pairs to the learner. then they would read the first word of each pair again, and four possible ways to complete it. the learner would press a button to indicate his response. if the answer was incorrect, the teacher would be instructed to deliver an electric shock to the learner. each wrong answer increased the voltage by 15 volts. (incidentally, in one version of the experiment, the learner would mention to the teacher that he or she suffered from a heart condition.) the 'teacher' participants believed the shocks were real. they weren't. the 'learners' were all actors, the electric shocks faked. but that didn't stop 65 per cent of the participants in milgram's first experiment administering the final massive 450-volt dose. every time any teacher was hesitant to continue delivering (and enhancing) the shocks, he was told by the experimenter: please continue. the experiment requires that you continue. it is absolutely essential that you continue. you have no other choice, you must go on. if a teacher still wanted to stop after receiving all of these verbal cues, the experiment was halted. otherwise, it was halted only after the learner had received the maximum 450-volt shock three times in a row.",0
2023-11-27,"milgram's experiment started three months after the trial of the german nazi war criminal adolf eichmann began in jerusalem. milgram set out to answer the question: could it be that eichmann, and those like him, were simply ""obeying orders""? in the milgram experiment, the bogeyman authority figure was not a senior army officer. it was just a man in a white coat...armed only with a clipboard. summarising his experiment, milgram wrote: ""i set up a simple experiment at yale university to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist. ""stark authority was pitted against the subjects' strongest moral imperatives against hurting others, and, with the subjects' ears ringing with the screams of the victims, authority won more often than not. ""the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation. ""ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process"". milgram's results are hardly unique. his study found an average compliance level to the maximum voltage (450 volts) of 62.5%. another study in the us then found 85% compliance, matched in germany, beaten in spain and holland, with studies in the uk showing 50%, australia 40%, austria 80%.",0
2023-11-27,"university ethics boards (rightly) outlawed milgram-style experiments in the late 1980s, so no other modern studies are available. but what does all this mean for investment? for craig zobel in 'compliance', authority was an unseen policeman. for philip zimbardo at stanford, authority was a prison guard. for stanley milgram, authority was a man in a white coat. for us, 'authority' is the us federal reserve. in fact, it's any central banker. and they are all just as susceptible to the corruption of power as the participants in the studies listed above. the individuals working at central banks are possibly normal and well-intentioned. but they operate within a perverse system, which does the world a great deal of damage. western central banks are dangerous for a number of reasons. quantitative easing the qe programmes they have pushed so aggressively have distorted relative prices across all asset types. they have only delayed the inevitable deleveraging. artificially low rates having driven policy rates down to zero, they have forced investors to chase yield. that means exposing themselves to higher degrees of risk than they might have otherwise. that's because cash deposits were until recently eliminated as a viable investment choice. kicking the can down the road in pumping up the money supply (and their balance sheets), they have set the scene for a potentially dangerous inflationary mess further down the line. if not now.",0
2023-11-27,"a false sense of security many investors accept that the central banks know what they are doing. even that ""they have everyone's back"", or what used to be known as the ""greenspan put"" – supporting equity markets – is alive and well. in the markets, there's a simple rule of thumb: don't fight the fed. given its almost unlimited monetary firepower, it has never made sense to bet against fed policy. but that was before the fed and its international peers went ""all-in"" with quantitative easing. now the west's central bankers have an existential problem: their influence over markets only works while investors believe that that influence still holds. be wary of rising interest rates. short term monetary policy rates can theoretically stay anchored in both the us and the uk and in europe. but neither the fed nor the bank of england nor the ecb can definitively prevent yields from rising in longer-dated government debt markets. and if even higher bond yields do manifest, equity markets are unlikely to be immune to them. is there a risk, then, that the ""ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process"". the good news is, we can also own gold.",0

2023-11-20,"buy gold miners! but now? article:'bullish now, disaster later' looms for wider stocks... gold mining stocks are not yet unique within the wider macro, but that does not preclude a move higher by the gdx index, says gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. it's just an inkling, but interesting. here is a visual per a post on x. with the weakening economic story (as ai robots seemingly run the show) unfolding, real areas like manufacturing continue to degrade. ism for october showed continued deceleration and so too did the new york fed's empire manufacturing survey. as the inflation story unwinds, and the fed is indicated to be backed into a less hawkish corner (check out the rapid fed funds de-hawking going on at cme group)... ...the macro turn, the big picture macro turn implied by the profound change in this chart's long-term trend, and other macro indicators, is on track. that big black, nearly engulfing monthly candle on the 30-year treasury bond yield sure will look like a reversal if we close november in this state. that will be personally appreciated for two reasons: it will make my guess per the post graphic above look like the product of genius, which it surely was not, and it will indicate that we are still on the preferred plans for a macro trend change, potentially of epic (and by most, unexpected) proportions.",0
2023-11-20,"all of this is to say that although gold miner stocks jumped with everything else on the weaker-than-expected cpi inflation data in mid-november, that very fact means they are not yet unique. so i should reel in my ill-titled article from last week. or more to the point, reel in the article's title: 'gold stocks: the time is now'. what i meant, and what i think is clear with a read of the article, is that the time is now as represented by the implications of the big picture chart above. as noted in the article, this would be subject to an interim and likely bull-ending seasonal broad market rally. ""now"" is not today, this minute. although, i think the odds are that given the developing macro, the gold miners will participate in the seasonal party that got off the ground at the end of october. the daily chart of gdx shows an imagining of a pattern first noted on monday, the day before the big pop on cpi tuesday. in other words, i called the low! how's them for some brazen words? well, actually i did not call the low. i simply highlighted a pattern that had potential. here is the chart from that post. gdx of today is still working on that theoretical pattern. as has been the case forever and a day (in nftrh analysis, at least) the very key level to take out in order to go bullish for an extended rally, is where the 200-day moving average meets resistance and now what we can call the pattern's neckline. no breakthrough there, no pattern activation.",0
2023-11-20,"break through there and well, activation! if the pattern activates, the upside target, which we've had on radar for many months, is the gap above 40. that would be quite a trade. but first there is work to do. take out the sma 50 (28.32), resistance just above it at 29 and then the sma 200/neckline combo. if those milestones are met, strap in for a potential hell of a trade. but consider this: the gold miners are not unique in this macro, especially if they do end the correction from the may double top and rally hard (assuming the broad bull party is ongoing). what would have made them unique is to take a final and ignominious drop while risk 'on' cyclical stuff had one final party in celebration of the weakening fed. but if the miners celebrate and go on to our upside target of gdx 40, they will be a 'sell' when the broad markets top, as expected in h1, 2024 (we will refine the analysis as usual along the way, in nftrh). the real buy for a long-term bull market could still be out ahead and from much lower levels. but how about this for one scenario among others? gold stocks rally to a new high for this rally that began a year ago. the broad stock market puts on its final act (and final suck-in of the herds, in progress). then, as the rapidly devolving inflation situation becomes uncomfortably disinflationary (ie, morphs to a deflation scare) the gold miners get sold down. we have various downside support objectives just as we have the upside gdx target of 40+.",0
2023-11-20,"the real art; the real separation of the macro players from the pretenders, could be well out in 2024. but if the gold stock sector does rally here in q4 (as implied by the seasonal averages), what's wrong with some outstanding profits prior to the necessary h1 2024 risk management implied by this forward macro view? meanwhile, it appears to be macro party season with the herds being tempted back in. herds? frogs! in a nice warm pot, swimming and resting their little heads over the fed hawk anxieties of the past. the setup for bullish now, disaster later is compelling. here's the circus ringleader here. i am playing it via quality (only) gold stocks (per nftrh weekly reports) but also through various other non-unique sectors that make sense as the us dollar drops due to a lack of fundamental support (fed policy). later, in 2024, i expect to have whittled down the scope to just the best gold mining stocks i can find, some junior/exploration specs, and short-term treasury bonds (after the fed eventually flips dovish and begins backing off its elevated funds rate, which has been driving nice income on cash). but first, a hard sell in the miners may come about before the buy for the long-term that will be missed by most. so you see, ""now"" means 'now', as in the time of a macro change, which takes months and years. the change already began, after all, 1.5 years ago when the 30 year treasury yield above, smashed through the formerly limiting moving averages. gold stocks?",0

2023-11-19,"freedonia can't escape the trilemma, but the usa? article:robert mundell's insight still rules, except the dollar... today we're considering the real environment that determines economic conditions, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. it has nothing to do with short-term data, fed policy, conventional economic models or other factors most economic commentary focuses on. instead, it has to do with the ""trilemma"" identified in the 1960s by economist robert mundell. mundell identified three critical policy variables that nations face: the central bank policy rate, the exchange rate and open capital accounts. he said that nations could control any two of these variables, but not all three at once. if you want to control the policy rate and the exchange rate you can, but you have to close your capital account. otherwise, if your policy rate is high and your capital account is open, capital will flow in and make your exchange rate higher than you want. or if you have a set exchange rate and open capital account, you have to let your policy rate float along with other central banks to avoid the exchange rate pressure. in the first case, you control the policy rate and have an open capital account, but you lose control over exchange rates. in the second case, you control your exchange rate and have an open capital account, but you lose control of your policy rate. the only way to control the policy rate and the exchange rate is to close the capital account.",1
2023-11-19,"as mundell explained, you can control two of the three factors, but not all three. if you try, you will fail – markets will make sure of that. a country that attempts to have all three will fail in one of several ways including a reserve crisis, an exchange rate crisis or a recession. consider the case of a country – call it freedonia – that wants to cut its interest rate from 3% to 2% to stimulate growth. at the same time, freedonia's main trading partner, sylvania, has an interest rate of 3%. freedonia also keeps an open capital account (to encourage direct foreign investment). finally, freedonia pegs its exchange rate to sylvania at a rate of 10-1. this is a ""cheap"" exchange rate designed to stimulate exports from freedonia to sylvania. in this example, freedonia is trying the impossible trinity. it wants an open capital account, a fixed exchange rate and an independent monetary policy (it has an interest rate of 2% while sylvania's rate is 3%). what happens next? the arbitrageurs get to work. they borrow money in freedonia at 2% in order to invest in sylvania at 3%. this causes the freedonia central bank to sell its foreign exchange reserves and print local currency to meet the demand for local currency loans and outbound investment. printing the local currency puts downward pressure on the fixed exchange rate and causes inflation in local prices. eventually something breaks.",1
2023-11-19,"country freedonia may run out of foreign exchange forcing it to close the capital account or break the peg (this is what happened to the uk in 1992 when george soros broke the bank of england). or country freedonia will print so much money that inflation will get out of control forcing it to raise interest rates again. the exact policy response can vary, but the end result is that country freedonia cannot maintain the trilemma. it will have to raise interest rates, close the capital account, break the peg or all three in order to avoid losing all of its foreign exchange and going broke. this shows you how powerful the trilemma is as an analytic tool. the major economies today all have mostly open capital accounts (although china does impose some restrictions), which means they can control interest rates or exchange rates, but not both. most major economies fix short-term interest rates, which means they lose control over exchange rates. this means the interest rate and the exchange rate have to be thought of as a pair. a higher interest rate generally results in a stronger currency. that's exactly what the us is experiencing today where sharply higher interest rates have resulted in a stronger dollar. the ability of central banks to pursue any interest rate policy they might prefer is further constrained by conditions in the real economy. central banks target policy rates intended to produce maximum real growth, low unemployment and price stability.",1
2023-11-19,"as noted above, if maximum potential real growth in the us is about 3%, the fed will target a neutral rate of interest (also called r*) that will produce 3% growth, which is consistent with price stability and should optimize employment at the same time. if the fed guesses at a neutral rate that is too high, they will slow the economy, hurt job growth and cause disinflation or deflation. if the fed guesses at a neutral rate that is too low, they will cause the economy to run hot, tighten labor markets and cause inflation. since the fed is guessing, they are likely to guess wrong. sooner than later, the fed's incorrect guess shows up in economic data. still, the result of trying to hit a neutral rate means central banks will wander high or low while trying to converge on the unseen target. other central banks are doing the same. this neutral rate targeting combined with mundell's trilemma shows us that all major central banks with reserve currency status are not really free agents but are highly constrained by the need to hit the neutral rate, avoid inflation or deflation and maintain reasonably stable exchange rates. this is a highly imperfect process with many errors committed along the way, but it does provide a framework for forecasting international monetary policy using just a few key factors. by the way, there's historically been one big exception to the trilemma. that's the united states. the us sets interest rates independently and has an open capital account.",1
2023-11-19,"the us does not officially peg the dollar to any other currency (thus technically not breaking the trilemma). but it does work with other countries to allow them to informally peg to the dollar. why hasn't the us suffered adverse consequences? because the us doesn't need foreign exchange. the dollar is still the leading reserve currency in the world (about 60% of global reserves and close to 90% of global foreign exchange trades), so the us can never run out of foreign exchange to pay for things. it can just print more dollars! this is what the french called the dollar's ""exorbitant privilege"" in the 1960s. now you see why so many trading partners like the brics nations are trying to escape from a dollar-denominated global system (among other reasons, like escaping dollar-based sanctions). the game is rigged against other countries, and in favor of the us. this is why the game won't last – and why king dollar's days are numbered.",1

'when you have your cost of debt effectively doubling, it sort of wipes out your equity return'..."" why should sand castles endure when the tide transitions? and why should industries endure when interest rates transition? if their foundations are firm they will withstand the attending blows. here is a fact, an elemental and fundamental fact: ""green"" energy – wind power, solar power, electric vehicles and the rest – remains vastly inefficient. it cannot endure absent heavy government subsidy. for example, our scientific men inform us that the american taxpayer extravagantly subsidizes the american electric vehicle industry. by how much? they inform us these subsidies will near $400 billion in coming years. what ukraine would not give to receive that $400 billion! what israel would not give to receive that $400 billion! what raytheon would not give to receive that $400 billion!",2
2023-11-17,"alas it will be unavailable to them. it will go to the subsidization of electric vehicles. our sister publication, the paradigm pressroom, recently cited a study by the edison electric institute. from which: ""ev advocates claim that the cost of electricity for ev owners is equal to $1.21 per gallon of gasoline, but the cost of charging equipment and charging losses, averaged out over 10 years and 120,000 miles, is $1.38 per gallon equivalent on top of that."" ""so $2.59 per gallon? i could live with that!"" said colleague emily clancy. [european readers can't dream of it, nor the current us price either.] as could your editor – and very likely you. regular gasoline presently trades at $3.34 the gallon. premium gasoline presently trades at $4.14 the gallon. seen in this aspect $2.59 is lovely. the green new dealers, its idiots useful and unuseful, its buglers in the media and the business concerns receiving the subsidies, will tell you it is in fact lovely. yet let us peer within this sweet, sweet bargain. let us glance the fine print within the contract... what does it read? adding the costs of the subsidies to the true cost of fueling an ev would equate to an ev owner paying $17.33 per gallon of gasoline. $17.33 the gallon! how do you like it? yet you cannot see it because it does not strike your eye at the charging station. it requires a more sensitive and penetrating ophthalmological apparatus to detect it. it requires a finer vision. most – alas – do not have it.",2

2023-11-13,"dollar beats brics, debt, deficits article:for now, at least... the dollar has been extremely strong over the past two years, writes jim rickards in the daily reckoning. this persistent dollar strength has been a mystery to many. after all, the dollar's problems are well known. the ratio of government debt to gdp for the united states is at a record high approaching 130% (a prudent level is considered 30%, and anything over 90% is a headwind to any economic growth at all). the us is running multitrillion-dollar deficits year after year. the congress and white house seem in the grip of modern monetary theory, which claims that the us can run unlimited deficits and accumulate unlimited debt without economic harm because it can print money in unlimited quantities to finance the debt and spending. meanwhile, projected annualized interest payments on the us national debt exceeded $1 trillion at the end of october, according to bloomberg. the cost of debt service has doubled in the past 19 months as interest rates have risen. this fiscal profligacy comes against a backdrop of social unrest and political dysfunction. we're facing a presidential election next year in which one candidate, biden, is senile and the other candidate, trump, may be behind bars on election day. take your pick. but the dollar keeps on chugging along. how can the dollar be so strong against such a dismal landscape? there are two answers to this question.",2
2023-11-13,"answer no.1 the first is that the dollar has its problems, but other currencies are in even worse shape. for example, the chinese yuan is on the brink of collapse being held aloft by non-sustainable intervention by chinese banks. the japanese yen is joined at the hip with the yuan because of the extent of japanese investment in china financed by japanese banks. with the yuan going down, the yen will go down in sync. so that's two major currencies with problems. meanwhile, europe and the uk have deindustrialized under the sway of the greeniacs pushing the green new scam policies. now europe faces a winter of freezing in the dark if cold weather is extreme and russia decides to turn off the energy taps. germany, the largest economy in the eurozone, is heading for recession if it isn't already in one, and the same is true for the uk that's two more major currencies facing troubles. so yes, the dollar has its problems, but as an investor do you really prefer sterling, euros, yen or yuan? answer no.2 the second reason for the dollar's strength is much more technical and not well understood, but it's critical to grasp. you don't need to nail down the technical details; it's enough that you understand the bigger picture. it involves the so-called eurodollar. eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposits held at foreign offices of major banks, and therefore fall outside the jurisdiction of the fed and us banking regulations.",2
2023-11-13,"the fed actually has very little influence over the global dollar market and the exchange value of the dollar. the old currency metrics of balance of trade and moves in capital accounts are leftovers from the world of fixed exchange rates, which have been gone for decades. what drives the dollar is the eurodollar market, as conducted by the world's largest banks in london, new york and tokyo. it's here where global liquidity and interest rates are actually determined. the eurodollar market needs a constant supply of depositors parking their money in offshore offices of major banks. right now, this market is in contraction. derivatives are being unwound, balance sheets are being trimmed and interbank overnight lending is being financed with collateral. and these banks are demanding the best collateral. they won't accept corporate debt, mortgages or even intermediate-term us treasuries. the only acceptable collateral consists of short-term us treasury bills, the shorter the better. this means 1-month, 3-month and 6-month bills. those are denominated in dollars, of course. in order to get the bills to post as collateral, banks have to buy dollars to buy the bills. this has created enormous demand for dollars. and that partly accounts for the strength of the dollar. again, it's not important that you understand the intricacies of the eurodollar system, just that high dollar demand in the eurodollar market is contributing to dollar strength.",2
2023-11-13,"the fundamental dollar shortage problem is not going away soon, and will continue to support the dollar. what about the prospect of a brics currency union and the move toward a new currency? i wrote a lot about that ahead of the brics leadership summit that took place back in august. this new currency would be gold-linked and would displace the dollar in time as a major player in world trade. shouldn't that be weakening the dollar? after all, the prospect of a brics currency should pose a severe threat to the petrodollar, which is a pillar of dollar strength. but this movement is still in its infancy and, unsurprisingly, is experiencing growing pains. it's not yet as unified as it needs to be if it's going to seriously threaten the dollar. and one of those brics nations – india – seems to be playing both sides. it was recently reported that india's government is expected to reject demands from russian oil companies to pay for russia's crude oil imports in chinese yuan. russia currently has a surplus of rupees and is having trouble spending them. at the same time, demand for yuan has grown as russia trades more with china. meanwhile, india mostly uses the dirham and us dollar to pay for russian oil imports. basically, india is currently in a balancing act. they consider russia an important economic ally while they consider china a geopolitical rival. india fears popularizing the yuan will hurt its own efforts to internationalize the rupee.",2
2023-11-13,"in fact, india was the only brics nation to oppose the introduction of a common currency, fearing it would benefit the yuan. india's refusal to give in to russia's demands leaves a significant role for the dollar, which is another reason to believe the dollar will retain its strength for the foreseeable future. now, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the dollar is strong. it isn't, for all the reasons i listed above. it's just stronger than its competitors, and that's why it appears strong. is there some way to tell if the dollar is actually getting stronger or weaker without making reference to other currencies? yes. the answer is gold. think of gold as a ruler that measures dollar strength or weakness. gold has gained close to 10% over the past month or so. i expect gold to become much stronger, despite some temporary setbacks along the way. investors should consider today's prices a gift and perhaps a last chance to acquire gold at these prices before the real safe haven race begins. below $2000 gold is so cheap right now, it's practically a steal. i strongly urge you to take advantage.",2
2023-11-11,"us fed losing money. so what? article:capital vs. operating losses help unpick the controversy... the federal reserve is running losses. does this cost anyone anything? ask jane l.johnson at the cobden centre, in this post first published at mises.org. financial statements of the us federal reserve, which consists of the board of governors in washington and twelve district reserve banks across the country, indicate that the consolidated system has generated both capital and operating losses for the past couple of years. the fed was created in 1913 to issue and circulate an ""elastic currency"" that could respond to consumers' demand for cash, end bank runs known then as ""money panics,"" and serve as a ""lender of last resort"" to the nation's commercial banks. how is it possible that the fed could be losing money after one hundred years of operation? the debate has raged in the banking and finance communities. two investigators, paul kupiec at the american enterprise institute and alex pollock at the mises institute, have analyzed fed financial statements and presented their findings about these fed losses in publications such as the wall street journal and on the websites of the american enterprise institute, the mises institute, the federalist society, and law and liberty. the wall street journal has also produced a nontechnical video explaining how the fed makes (and loses) money.",2
2023-11-11,"the fed's capital losses are derived from its large bond portfolio of low-coupon us treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchased in earlier times of low rates during the period of quantitative easing following the 2008-09 financial crisis. as the fed has now raised interest rates in its efforts to reduce inflation, the market value of its bond portfolio has inevitably declined. estimates of these capital losses range as high as $100 billion. the bond portfolio resides in the system open market account, which is managed by the federal reserve bank of new york on behalf of the entire fed system. the fed's operating losses, on the other hand, result when its expenses run higher than its revenues. the fed's revenues consist mostly of interest income on its large bond portfolio. the fed's expenses include payment of interest on commercial banks' reserves on deposit at fed district banks and reverse repurchase (repo) transactions with money market funds, as well as fed overhead expenses such as the operations of the consumer financial protection bureau, which is funded by the fed rather than as an independent agency funded by congress. the us supreme court is currently considering the constitutionality of this funding arrangement between the fed and the consumer financial protection bureau. the fed's expenses are annually running $100 billion above fed revenues, with potentially higher levels later.",2
2023-11-11,"such operating losses are unique for the fed, which throughout its years of operation has generated annual surpluses. these surpluses are by law transferred to the us treasury to help pay the many governmental expenses such as defense, entitlement programs, interest on federal debt, and the many other myriad federal outlays. the fed's operating and capital losses are genuine in both an accounting and an economic sense. though the federal reserve has designed its own accounting rules rather than subscribing to those of the financial accounting standards board, the fed's own financial reports clearly show ongoing accounting losses by any metric. and because of interest rate increases since 2022, the market value of the fed's portfolio of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities has declined. both types of losses are also genuine in terms of the economic principle that one cannot gain something for nothing, that nothing is ""free"" despite claims to the contrary, and every action or choice taken in life always incurs an opportunity cost measured as the cost of the foregone option. economics also analyzes the incidence of costs – that is, on whom the cost burden actually falls, which is not necessarily the party on whom it may initially appear to fall.",2
2023-11-11,"although a retail sales tax, for example, is nominally paid by a buyer at the point of sale, further analysis reveals that the incidence of a sales tax falls on both buyer and seller (but not necessarily in equal shares), depending on the relative price elasticities (i.e., responsiveness to price changes) of supply and demand for the item in question. with respect to the fed's losses, on whom these losses fall is another matter, but economic analysis clearly shows that these losses are not without costs to one or more parties. two candidates are likely to absorb the fed's operating losses: american taxpayers as a whole. now that the fed is incurring operating losses instead of surpluses that would otherwise be paid over to the us treasury, federal budget deficits are commensurately larger, requiring the treasury to sell more debt in order pay its bills. this is an obvious cost to american current and future taxpayers. commercial banks that are members of the federal reserve system, which are required to buy and hold stock shares in their respective fed district banks. the 1913 federal reserve act specified that these member banks could be assessed for fed system losses. if the fed were to make this demand of its member commercial banks, they would be obligated to cover the fed system's losses. again, there is no precedent for this. some observers disagree that the fed's operating and capital losses must be borne by one or more parties.",2
2023-11-11,"jason furman, a professor at harvard university's john f.kennedy school of government and former chair of president obama's council of economic advisors, expresses an alternate view. in a recent wall street journal op-ed, he explains that the fed turned a cumulative profit of over $1 trillion from 2008-22, and that current annual losses of about $100 billion do not impede the fed's ability to fulfil its mandate to ensure maximum employment and price stability. with rising interest rates, the fed is paying higher rates to commercial banks' deposits held at fed district banks, well in excess of what it earns on its portfolio of treasury and mutual broadcasting system securities. now that the fed is running losses, it simply books them as a ""deferred asset,"" an accounting technique unique to its own accounting rules. furman further explains that the fed was never designed to turn a profit, and that the fed need not hold any capital because insolvency is a meaningless concept in the world of central banking. he also explicitly notes ""partisan gamesmanship and shortsightedness"" as a reason not to denigrate the fed's fluctuating profits as it apolitically fulfils its mandated responsibilities. kupiec and pollock responded with a letter to the editor of the wall street journal to reiterate their earlier conclusions that american taxpayers will ultimately bear the cost of the fed's losses.",2
2023-11-11,"when asked by email how he can justify his claim that no one, including taxpayers, actually bears the cost of the fed's losses, professor furman responded as follows: the fed's losses do lead to higher debt. and its gains to lower debt. on net it has reduced the debt. but it is a public entity and we didn't assign it the job of maximizing profits – and for good reason – we should leave that to the private sector. instead we assigned it macroeconomic goals which it has done well at times and done badly at other times – like in not responding fast enough to inflation in 2021. the accounting analysis clearly indicates that the fed system is presently incurring both operating and capital losses. honest differences of opinion can arise, but numbers do not lie. and economic principles tell us that no one can reap something for nothing, that the costs and benefits of any action will always redound to one or more parties. do political agendas perhaps explain the differences in opinion about the fed's losses? is it possible that investigators at two right-of-center think tanks can read the data so differently than does an ivy league university professor? denying that taxpayers will ultimately bear the cost of the fed's dual losses is tantamount to averring that inflation isn't a tax on everyone, or that federal student loan forgiveness doesn't cost taxpayers anything.",2

""we need to reform the federal reserve."" we are told this should be done or that should be done. this will make it more efficient, that will make it more transparent. and perhaps even it would. yet we take a dim view of most ""reform"". the reason is simple as sam and clear as gin. reform is an ax that rarely strikes the root. that is often by design. it is designed to deliver a glancing blow – to leave the root largely unhacked. that is because too many interested parties draw sap from the root. it is the very source of their prosperity. authentic reform would shatter the root – and the sustenance it offers a selected few. h.l.mencken labeled reform ""mainly a conspiracy of prehensile charlatans to mulct the american taxpayer."" we believe he was correct. the late libertarian frank chodorov said most reform aspires to ""clean up the whorehouse [while] keeping the business intact."" for a more fitting analogy we seek in vain. we file only this one caveat: the whorehouse – for all its sin – at least does an honest trade. a fellow emerges from this den of carnality somewhat lighter in the wallet, it is true. yet he also emerges somewhat lighter in spirits. he has gotten value for money. can the same be said for the federal reserve? its very business is false.",1

2023-11-05,"another bank down. could cbdc fix it? article:sixth us bank fails this year... citizens bank was a small bank in iowa with about $66 million in assets, says jim rickards in the daily reckoning. its loan portfolio consisted largely of commercial and industrial loans. and last month the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) announced that citizens bank had failed due to significant hidden loan losses totaling about $15 million. because citizens bank was not a member of fdic, the bank's losses will be the responsibility of the state of iowa. this is the sixth notable bank failure this year. as you might recall, the first five were silicon valley bank (back in march), silvergate bank (a bridge from the crypto world), signature bank (another crypto conduit to the regular banking world), first republic bank and the giant credit suisse. i warned in march that the failure of silicon valley bank would be just the start. now we've had five additional bank failures. and this latest failure won't be the last. veterans of such crises (and i include myself in that category) know that once the dominoes start falling, they keep falling until some government intervention of a particularly draconian kind is imposed. we've seen some significant regulatory actions from the federal reserve, the fdic, the us treasury and the swiss national bank, but the fixes have been temporary and followed quickly by new failures.",2
2023-11-05,"the fdic abandoned its $250,000 deposit insurance limit and effectively guaranteed all the depositors in silicon valley bank and signature bank, a guarantee of over $200 billion in deposits. this has impacted the fdic insurance fund and required higher insurance premiums from solvent banks, the cost of which is ultimately borne by consumers (you). the federal reserve went further and offered to lend money at par for any government securities tendered as collateral by member banks even if the collateral was worth only 80% or 90% of par. these collateralized loans are financed with newly printed money, which might exceed $1 trillion. these actions have thrown the us banking system and bank depositors into utter confusion. are all bank deposits now insured or just the ones janet yellen decides are ""systemically important""? what's the basis for that decision? what about the fact that unrealized losses on us bank portfolios of government securities now exceed $700 billion? if those losses are realized to provide cash to fleeing depositors, it could wipe out much of the capital of the banking system. unrealized losses on securities held by fdic-insured banks exceed $620 billion. that's the amount of bank capital that would be wiped out if the banks were forced to sell those securities to meet demands from depositors who wanted their money back. that would cause additional bank failures and continue the panic that began in march indefinitely.",2
2023-11-05,"we're not out of the woods, and the confusion will continue. what's important to bear in mind is that crises of this type are not over in days or weeks. a slow-motion rolling panic that takes a year or longer is more typical. the 1998 crisis reached the acute stage on sept. 28, 1998, just before the rescue of ltcm. we were hours away from the sequential shutdown of every stock and bond exchange in the world. but that crisis began in june 1997 with the devaluation of the thai baht and massive capital flight from asia and then russia. it took 15 months to go from a serious crisis to an existential threat. likewise, the 2008 crisis reached the acute stage on sept. 15, 2008, with the bankruptcy filing of lehman bros. but that crisis began in the spring of 2007 when hsbc surprised markets with an announcement that mortgage losses had exceeded expectations. it then continued through the summer of 2007 with the failures of two bear steans high-yield mortgage funds, and the closure of a société générale money market fund. the panic then caused the failures of bear stearns (march 2008), fannie mae and freddie mac (june 2008) and other institutions before reaching lehman bros. for that matter, the panic continued after lehman to include aig, general electric, the commercial paper market and general motors before finally subsiding on march 9, 2009. starting with the hsbc announcement, the subprime mortgage panic and domino effects lasted 24 months from march 2007 to march 2009.",2
2023-11-05,"averaging our two examples (1998, 2008) the average duration of these financial crises is about 20 months. since this crisis began in march (eight months ago), it could have a long way to run. in other words, crises can unfold for a long time before they're finally squashed by massive regulatory intervention. get ready for more bank failures. i've written a lot about what i call biden bucks. that's my term for the central bank digital currency (cbdc) the government is currently preparing. what does the ongoing banking crisis have to do with biden bucks? well, plenty, as it turns out. whether an account is in cbdc or a regular checking account doesn't make that much difference. bank runs today are no different than in the 1930s from a behavioral perspective. it's all about lost confidence, fear, not wanting to be the last person out of a burning building, rumors, word of mouth and a host of psychological factors that are part of human nature. that part hasn't changed since at least the 14th century with the failure of the bardi and peruzzi banks around 1345. what has changed is technology. marshall mcluhan said in the 1960s that in the global village, everyone knows everything at the same time. he was right. that means when a bank run begins, there's an immediate reaction. the difference with the 1930s is that you don't line up around the corner and wait for the chance to demand cash from the teller.",2
2023-11-05,"you take out your iphone, make a few taps and, whether it's venmo or a wire transfer, the money is on its way out the door. whether you're a retail depositor with $1000 or a maven with $8 billion, everyone was online moving money all at once. in that sense, cbdcs don't matter much. whether it's cbdc, venmo, wire transfer or cash from an atm, everyone is cashing out at the same time via digital channels. but there is one huge impact of cbdcs that is entirely new and sets them apart from what's described above... cbdcs are programmable and controlled by the government. this means when a run develops, the government can stop the run just by freezing cbdc account transfers. they can even claw back earlier transfers. since the government controls the cbdc ledger, they can see where the early withdrawals went and simply reinstate them on the account of the failing bank and debit them from the accounts of the transferees. the government can do this with a few keystrokes because they see everything. this means that once biden bucks is implemented, you're locked into a system controlled by the government. you're in a money jail. there's no point even starting a bank run because the government can track your movements and put the money back where it started. it's one of many ways that biden bucks gives the government total control of your money and can monitor your thoughts and movements.",2
2023-11-05,"cash is likely to be eliminated sooner rather than later in order to pave the way for the dominance of central bank digital currencies. a us dollar cbdc is coming soon. cash will have to be eliminated to force individuals into the cbdc world. for better or worse, the only way citizens will be able to avoid the mandatory use of cbdcs will be to use gold, silver or cryptocurrencies. i put comparisons of gold (and silver) and bitcoin in the same category as comparing fish and bicycles. you can do it, but what's the point? gold is money and bitcoin is a hallucinogen;(or more precisely an acoustic hypnotic spell). the idea that the us treasury, fed and other mainstream monetary institutions are hostile to crypto is absolutely correct. for 10 years they have taken the view that they don't like it but don't know what to do about it. now they know. the solution is to kill it. of course, bitcoin and other cryptos have their own ecosystem of exchanges, derivatives, custodians, payment channels, tickers, etc., etc. but so what? cryptos are like chips in a casino. you can make money or lose money gambling with the chips. but if you walk outside with chips in your pocket, they're worthless. you can change tables at the casino but you can't leave the casino. chips only have value inside. if you want to spend money outside, you have to visit the cashier first to cash in your chips. the cashier is the portal from the crypto world to the real world of money.",2
2023-11-05,"that's why the fdic took over signature bank on sunday, march 12, when they shut down silicon valley bank. signature bank was no worse off than a lot of other banks. if it had survived until monday, march 13, it would have been rescued by the federal reserve's bank term funding program (btfp) along with the entire us banking system. why did signature bank get whacked under those circumstances? signature bank got whacked because it was offering a portal to the crypto world called signet. once the fdic announced a blanket deposit guarantee and the fed offered an unlimited ability to swap bonds for cash at par, signature would have been fine like any other bank. yellen used a panicked weekend to wipe out the signet portal. as rahm emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste. this is one example of how crypto is getting strangled globally. cbdcs are being set up to replace cryptos as a digital currency. as for gold, you can manipulate the price for short periods of time by dumping gold, painting the tape, acting in concert, etc. but those techniques are not sustainable (unless you want to sell all your gold, in which case you end up with no gold and the market still goes its way). the london gold pool price rigging agreement collapsed in 1968. british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown sold almost half of the uk's gold in 1999 at a near 20-year low, a notorious effort at price manipulation known as brown's bottom.",2
2023-11-05,"both are good examples of how manipulation always fails in the end. the government could try a replay of fdr's gold confiscation from 1933, but it won't work this time because there's no trust in the government's promises. there are many reasons for this. no one trusts the government today, whereas in 1933 there was a belief that fdr knew what he was doing and was trying to end the great depression. covid is a good example of how people were lied to about vaccines, masks, etc. the rule today is ""don't get fooled again."" no one will surrender their gold except perhaps the people still wearing masks. but they probably don't have any gold to begin with. the other reason gold confiscation won't work is that gold is not fixed in price as it was in 1933. very few saw the dollar devaluation from $20 per ounce to $35 per ounce of gold coming that fdr orchestrated in 1933. that gold price increase (really a dollar devaluation) wasn't announced until months after the confiscation. it was the ultimate in insider trading organized by fdr. informed citizens won't fall for that a second time. in a non-pegged market as we have today, the crisis will come first and gold will go to $5,000 or $10,000 per ounce or higher before the government gets around to an attempted confiscation. by that point the damage is done and gold owners have their winnings. how should everyday americans evaluate the crisis choice between gold and cryptos as alternatives to the dollar?",2
2023-11-05,ask the following questions: can crypto get whacked by governments? yes. can gold be manipulated in the long-run? no. those questions and answers really answer the bigger question of how to survive the collapse of the dollar. gold works. crypto doesn't. 'nuff said.,2
2023-11-01,"what oil means for gold mining stocks article:tracking the gor against the gdx... gold mining stock charts have not yet confirmed a sustainable rally, and current fundamentals may be a headwind, says gary tanashian in his notes from the rabbit hole. we have used this daily chart of the gold stock etf (gdx) in written and video updates to keep nftrh subscribers apprised of the progress of the bounce from the early october low (after previously using the chart to manage the long correction that began with the may double top). the sentiment and oversold conditions at the early october low were powerful enough to spring a strong rebound or even to end the bear phase in force since may. the break above the top of the falling wedge on the chart above was a positive, as a falling wedge in this case is a massive bull flag. however, i regard falling and rising wedges among the less reliable patterns in ta. so there's your caveat. on the plus side, the gold miners bullish percent index shows a still deeply oversold condition. when the bpgdm 20-month ema hits lows – as it did a few weeks ago – it tends to spring back much harder than it has currently. this implies that there is more fuel to the rally from this perspective. there are a couple concerning signals in play that will remain proprietary to nftrh. but here is one that conventional gold mining analysts should be considering. we first noted it in nftrh a few weeks ago.",0
2023-11-01,"the gold/oil ratio (gor) was negative for the entirety of the q3 period that is about to be reported this earnings season. crude oil/energy is a large factor in mining costs and the miners' product under-performed in q3. the questions now are... to what degree does the ratio impact the miners' bottom lines and has the impact been factored? will the market be smart enough to look ahead, rather than react to what is already behind? if the market is looking ahead it sees the gor breaking the downtrend and turning up. the gor is not nearly a comprehensive fundamental indicator for gold mining stocks. but it is a very primary one, and if this breakout continues mining operational fundamentals will improve nicely. as the technical situation stalls where it is supposed to stall, a still deeply depressed sector is not carrying much froth, which is contrary positive. the short-term technical situation is stalled after all, not broken. however, the sector has been fairly 'anti-usd' and painted more often than not with the brush that paints commodities. again, we are managing signals in play that are concerning for the anti-usd/inflation trades. but for the purposes of this article, note that the techncials are at a decision point while the fundamentals (including and beyond the gor) make moves to improve. when viewing the macro funda, there is a whole range of items that need to be considered and factored, which we do in weekly reports and nftrh+ updates.",0
2023-11-01,"that said, watch this earnings season closely. if the sector bulls (first objective: take out the sma 200 on gdx) it could be looking ahead to the improving macro i see for 2024, and if it puts on a final decline – and the fundamentals continue to improve – we'll have a table pounder of a buying opportunity. that opportunity would come at the expense of those who've been guided by, and acted upon improper fundamental analysis not only since 2020, but on the long inflationary phase from 2003 to 2023. to the surprise of most, the gold mining sector will become something special only when the inflation > disinflation/goldilocks progression we are currently experiencing morphs to a deflation scare. and if the fed's hands are still tied and it cannot or will not effectively commit inflationary bailouts of bubble assets once again, so much the better for the long-term health of the gold mining sector.",0

2023-10-31,"right now however, long-time pundits and analysts would point to 3 things: first, silver isn't following, let alone leading, and the cheaper metal tends to amplify the moves in gold when the yellow metal is enjoying a deep and sustained move higher. second, gold mining stocks are also lagging the yellow metal. again, that says real money is shy of gold's long-term prospects right now. the hui index has risen 15.4% over the last 12 months, but gold itself is up 17.7% in dollar terms, and friday's pop in mining share prices still leaves the sector over 5% lower for 2023-to-date right now. third, and to repeat and repeat, no one is buying bullion. not net of selling. no one that anyone can see. ""gold is overbought in dollar terms on the [relative strength index] and getting that way on the bollinger basis,"" says long-time bullion analyst rhona o'connell, now at brokerage stonex, studying her charts.

2023-10-31,"that leaves, like we keep saying, the unusual suspects of central-bank gold buyers, led by china, india, singapore and thailand over the last 3 years. central banks already took their net gold demand as a group up to record levels in 2022, and 2023 looks very likely to top it on best estimates for the gold demand which those hoarders do not deign to report. but really, today? or over the past 3 weeks? honestly, do the state-employed national asset managers of beijing, new delhi, shenton way and bangkok present the most likely suspects for rushing to bid up gold to new record highs even as they try to grow their bullion holdings for long-term security, stability and diversification? i doubt it. not compared to this lot. see the blue circle, top right? it highlights the 2nd highest figure ever for the red line. and that red line tracks how over-excited the hot money has got in gold, betting on prices rather than actually paying those prices to buy any gold. look, as we noted in last week's update, something very odd happened in the gold derivatives market in the immediate aftermath of hamas' vile atrocities in israel. speculative traders – better known as 'managed money' by us regulator the cftc, which collects the data on trader positioning each tuesday – actually grew their net bearish position from the week before using comex futures and options. in other words, the hot money was betting that gold prices would fall.",0
2023-10-31,"but since then, the ghouls of gold have reverted to type, cutting their bearish bets and hiking their bullish bets as a group. and that move has been so rapid, it's flipped the managed money category from net bearish to solidly bullish. more dramatically, it has added 328 tonnes of notional gold to their net position overall (red line, right-hand axis above)... ...the fastest 2-week rise ever outside of mid-2019's sudden spike, when the world and her husband suddenly decided the fed would start slashing us interest rates amid a us recession which would drive gold prices higher. remember, this isn't even make-believe gold. no one betting on the gold price via the futures market wants to own physical bullion. they would just go and buy it if they did (say, using bullionvault to keep their costs low and their 24/7 access unbeatable, like their physical security). no, what these speculators want instead is to bet $1 for the chance of a $10 gain if things run their way. and after the managed money was caught short when gold prices started to jump following the horrors of 7th october, it has now rushed to get long... ...and it's rushed faster than any time on record outside mid-2019. maybe they're right. maybe gold will keep pushing higher, rising and holding above $2000 per troy ounce.",0
2023-10-31,"but if so, then actual gold buyers will at some point need to start swallowing and stop selling the steep cost jump of the last 2 weeks... ...now pricing gold 10% higher in us dollar terms and up at fresh record highs in most other currencies. could that happen? yes of course it could. and it very well might. how else do you think gold went from $250 back in 2001 up to $2000 today? gold's big jumps always spook jewellery consumers, and they invite profit-taking among physical traders and investors too. but the underlying uptrend in gold started long before hamas' terrorists broke into southern israel. and it has always needed...and always got...buyers to come in eventually, whether on a pullback or on swallowing their desire for a dip. all this said, the stars aren't classically aligned for gold to run and run, not on the 'old hands' criteria at the top. maybe silver and the hui will suddenly catch up, or maybe something is different this time. but it also needs noting that the $2000 handle clearly represents a big psychological level for the global gold market to accept. to date it has rejected it 3 times. gold's floor since the last attempt in april-may this year, however, came in much higher than it had come in following the 2 previous tops. the floor rose even though demand from western private investors was much lower and then turned outright negative.",0
2023-10-31,"so to repeat: central banks are playing a huge part in this, as pretty much everyone i spoke to about it agreed at this month's lbma conference. and this time, gold $2000 has come as the world runs into the key diwali-christmas-chinese-new-year period. yes, the recent price surge will hurt tonnage demand among those consumers. but many private households must buy some gold during this period, whatever the price. and as gold turns to face 2024, history says that if this attempt above $2000 doesn't quite hold, those consumers are sure to buy the hell out of any dip, bringing the floor higher again as the global gold market gets used to higher ground once more.",0
2023-10-30,"fighting forced frugality in 2024 article:invest in things you can control... i would summarize the economic flow of recent events like this, says charles hugh smith on his oftwominds blog in this article re-posted on addison wiggin's daily reckoning. 2020-21: massive stimulus and pandemic restrictions build up household savings and generate a stock market ""meme stock"" bubble. mid-2021-22: ""revenge spending"" splurging generates massive spike in consumption, profiteering and inflation. 2023: renewed bubbles in housing and stocks, a classic ""rebound/echo"" bubble. splurging wanes as savings and credit are tapped out, and higher interest rates finally start affecting behavior. 2024: forced frugality as jobs are slashed, profits fall, inflation stays sticky, credit dries up, businesses close, federal reserve stimulus wanes and soaring government borrowing costs crimps government spending. i've often discussed that the economy and society are cyclical. nothing stays on the same trajectory forever. history shows that when prices rise sharply, they rarely return to their previous levels as participants quickly habituate to the higher costs. taxes, fees, rents, etc. rarely decline. owners will keep prices high until they go broke rather than lower prices, as their own costs are also sticky. so what's the best way to reduce the risks of forced frugality manifesting as recession/depression that affects us? i've written a book on self-reliance.",2
2023-10-30,"my approach to self-reliance is to differentiate it from self-sufficiency by focusing on: lowering our exposure to the risks created by deglobalization, definancialization, instability and forced frugality; taking control of our resources/assets rather than leaving them exposed to the excesses/errors of asset managers, the federal reserve, politicians, etc. these are of course related: by taking control of our skills/resources/assets, we're accepting responsibility for their management, and the responsibility of lowering the risks of our assets being impaired by events outside our control. the basics of lowering risk are common-sense: lower expenses, needs, expectations, obligations: it's easier to get enough of whatever you need if you need very little. eliminate debt: uncertainties abound in our net income, but debt payments are certainties. fewer bad things can happen to us if we're debt-free. have plans in place to respond to much more severe challenges / crises than the mainstream reckons are possible. avoid relying on speculative gains to provide income and security: easy come, easy go. the status quo is optimized to function at a low simmer. there are only a handful of first responders and minimal resources available at any one time, and limited institutional know-how to deal with crises that overwhelm the narrow boundaries of ""normal"" consumption, supply chains, etc.",2
2023-10-30,"the wind-driven firestorm that consumed lahaina on maui is a tragic example of how thin resources are spread, and how they're optimized for conventional risks (for example, a single building on fire). the immediate overwhelming of response resources is only the first domino. all the follow-on responses are equally ill-equipped for any contingency above a low-level event, or series of events. consider the limited staff and capabilities of the maui county planning and building permits department. how is this small staff and limited system going to issue permits for the 1,900 structures that were destroyed? even the capacity of larger regions is quickly overwhelmed by even a blip in permit demand. the malibu (california) fire in 2018 burned 600 residences to the ground, and five years later, fewer than 300 homes have been built or permitted. bureaucratic inertia and over-regulation are factors that there are few incentives to overcome. 600 homes is a tiny blip of signal noise in the vast megalopolis of la. yet even this insignificant number has fatally log-jammed the status quo. households, businesses, institutions and government agencies are no longer very resilient. the vast majority depend on global supply chains and services performed by others for virtually everything. once those break down or are overwhelmed, the majority are helpless as they have few real-world skills, few planned responses and few real-world resources.",2
2023-10-30,"as i have often noted, many locales are highly vulnerable to disruption because they're almost totally dependent on long global supply chains for essentials as they lack local sources. moving out of such locales to places with at least some local resources (water, energy, food, manufacturing, etc) and a cultural-social memory (values and connections) of self-reliance, self-help, community and sharing reduces risks and increases our options for influencing what happens to us. i have long held that the ""bug-out cabin"" is not a resilient option. self-reliance is much better served by becoming a useful member of a productive, trustworthy network of productive people and local enterprises in a functioning community. diversifying our assets is the basic strategy to reducing risk. much of the investment field is aimed at the top 10% who own most of the financial wealth, so ""diversification"" means distributing a large nest egg of wealth into conventional ""boxes"": some in precious metals, some in income-producing real estate, some in dividend-paying stocks, some in bonds, etc. the problem with this approach is two-fold: not every household has a large nest egg of financial wealth that can be divvied up in passive investments. all of these passive asset classes could be disrupted by authorities responding to financial/economic crises.",2
2023-10-30,"precious metals, stocks and bonds could be restricted, frozen, heavily taxed or expropriated by one means or another, and rental real estate could be restricted by rent control. authorities have few limits on their responses, and their desperation to keep the status quo glued together by whatever means are at hand will be near-infinite. many such options are time-tested and legal. a ""windfall tax"" on profits and capital gains is legal, for example, and there are no upper limits on such ""special levies"". local authorities can forcibly acquire property via eminent domain, and should real estate valuations plummet, the ""fair value"" paid for the property might be minimal. the wealthy will have targets on their back, as the bottom 90% will support ""wealth taxes"" because they won't have to pay them. the authorities will leave assets the majority own (the family house) alone to avoid the risk of political blowback/disorder. the top 10% are the natural target as they 1) own 90% of the income-producing wealth 2) are a minority and 3) politically vulnerable to charges of rigging the system to their own benefit. not all assets are of equal utility. a house will continue to have utility as shelter regardless of its market value. it doesn't matter if the house is worth $1,000 or $1 million if it's owned debt-free and provides shelter. not all assets generate income we can actually control.",2
2023-10-30,"renting out a studio or room in our house is unlikely to face much regulatory risk, and we control who we rent to and under what conditions. in previous eras, taking boarders was a common path to generating income for widows who had lost their husbands and their income. the core concept here is that if you have few resources or assets, invest them in an enterprise you own and control that has the potential to generate more income than passive investments. for example, the capital gains/income potential of $5,000 invested passively in precious metals, bonds or stocks is negligible. but this modest sum could go a long way in setting up an enterprise based on skills, networking, etc – ie, an enterprise whose value is generated not by the sum invested but by the skills and social capital leveraged by the modest financial investment. one of the points of my book on self-reliance is to highlight the lack of basic life skills in today's populace when compared to the populace in emerson's time (1840s). i admit to being stunned by how many people do not know how to change the oil in their car, make minimal mechanical repairs, nurture plants/trees, do basic home repairs, or prepare simple, real-food meals from scratch. in an economy optimized for efficiency and profitability, tasks are segmented and specialized. jobs where we're paid for having a spectrum of broad-based skills are rare. we're paid to be specialists, and encouraged to pay other specialists to do everything for us.",2
2023-10-30,"many people are finding it difficult to find a handyperson who can do a variety of small repairs. those who are available are often overbooked and pricey. i've heard some online sources claiming a handyperson can make $1,000 a day. even if that overstates reality, the trajectory is clear: the number of people with a broad range of skills is narrow, and further narrowed to those willing to put up with all the hassles of running an enterprise and dealing with customers. in an era where risks are multiplying and hard to assess, optimizing our lives for broad-based life skills, zero-debt, direct control of our assets, and becoming valued contributing members of networks of productive, trustworthy people will lower our exposure to risk and increase our security. if the status quo manages to continue on its present course, none of these strategies reduce our enjoyment. reducing risk by adding skills and enterprise works just as well in good times. if things unravel, these risk-reduction strategies quickly shift from ""nice to have"" to ""essential."" but by then, it will be too late to put them in place. as the chinese saying puts it: when you're thirsty, it's too late to dig a well.",2
2023-10-29,"high yields vs. gold: why hasn't the price sunk? article:yield curve steepener continues, gold price strong... many have questioned why the gold price has failed to do the normal thing, writes gary tanashian. that normal thing being to decline significantly in the face of high 'real' yields – themselves an indication of very tight monetary policy... further, the gold price has held up despite muted high yield spreads (implying intact risk 'on' investor behavior), despite the intact goldilocks phase (inflation cooling, but not too cool) that has benefited the us dollar and the stock market in 2023, and other signals typically negative for gold. assuming that the war input (never a healthy reason to be long-term bullish on gold) is limited, since gold was in a normal and healthy correction (but well above what the macro signals would normally imply) before the disaster in israel and gaza erupted, we might simply assign the golden anomalies in play now to the fact that it's a new macro with new rules. here again is my favorite picture of a new macro beckoning new rules. in nftrh 779 we began a process of defining the possibilities in play by the implications of this chart. that will have to remain proprietary to nftrh, but my jaw dropped a little when considering the sheer beauty and symmetry in play.",0
2023-10-29,"it has to do with the differences in inflation/deflation dynamics before something broke (2022 spike above the monthly moving averages in the 30-year treasury bond yield continuum) and today, in the aftermath and birth of the new macro. but the main point is that something changed profoundly and if you're following the playbook of 2000-2022, that is akin to following bill belichick and his obsoleted coaching style (and/or roster construction philosophy) vs. today's nfl. interestingly, the new england patriots dynasty began the year the great inflationary maestro, alan greenspan, kicked the age of 'inflation ondemand' into gear in 2001 and ended the day tom brady walked out the door, soon to be followed by the old macro door closing and a new one opening. one indication that will likely turn out to be a tail wind to the gold price is the yield curve; in this case the 10yr-2yr yield curve. the curve has done as we'd projected after the secondary inversion extreme and is now ticking new cycle highs and soon an undoing of the inverted state. why does a yield curve steepener favor gold? well first off, let's review the fact that a steepening yield curve can come under deflationary pressure, or inflationary pressure, or both over the course of an extended steepener. as an example, the run up to the 2008 deflationary liquidation featured a steepening curve in 2007-2008 that began inflationary and resolved deflationary.",0
2023-10-29,"a steepening yield curve under deflationary pressure implies that markets are going risk 'off', seeking liquidity of short-term cash equivalents over speculation in long-term debt instruments. gold is favored in relation to risk assets like stocks, commodities and even silver as its monetary aspects come into play as a safe haven. this safe haven can eventually turn into a play on the gold price as well, when markets get a whiff of dovishness emanating from policymakers' various orifices. but the main feature is that the 'real' price of gold, as measured in a spectrum of risk assets, would rise and likely rise hard regardless of whether or not the nominal gold price is rising. the above also happens to be the investment case for gold mining stocks. listen to analysis claiming china, rising oil prices, inflation and war are positives for gold stocks if you will. but it is wrong and it's no wonder legions of gold bugs have been perma-wrong while making excuses about wrong-doing from our overlords or whatever. when gold rises vs. risk assets like stocks and mining costs like oil and materials, the fundamental picture will improve and the miners will do what they have not done over the last 20 years; leverage the gold price in a positive manner. see last week's as the new macro engages, gold stocks to shine for a compelling picture of the hui/gold ratio juxtaposed against the new macro. the deflationary view is the favored dominant view for the new steepener.",0
2023-10-29,"right now the steepener is signaled to be under inflationary pressure with nominal yields rising, but when nominal yields top out the curve will be likely to continue steepening under deflationary pressure because risk asset prices will be tanking. ""signaled to be under inflationary pressure"" does not mean inflationary pressure is building in this case. we have documented all along since projecting a broad recovery in q4, 2022 that inflationary pressures would wane, and they have done just that. don quixote is tilting at his inflationary windmill for other reasons, in my opinion. like perhaps a federal government that refuses to muzzle itself and stop its sublime levels of debt spending. a steepening yield curve under inflationary pressure would theoretically paint the fed as behind the curve. but of course, the fed is currently tight...very tight, as the 3 month t-bill continues to diverge the 2yr yield as it has prior to previous bear markets in stocks. this divergence should eventually crack the stock market into a bear market. the very fact that the fed appears intent on cracking inflated asset markets implies that an inflationary yield curve steepener is way out on the horizon. but no matter the mix of deflationary and inflationary pressure on the yield curve, a firm steepener of the yield curve usually implies economic hardship if not an outright economic bust. gold. is. counter. cyclical...relative to speculative risk assets.",0
2023-10-29,"through years of moaning, in some corners, about gold's lack of performance, let's just note that gold has generally performed better than it should have performed with macro signaling such as it has been since mid-2020. but firmness in the gold price – again, backing out the war inputs, which are there and do complicate if not compromise the fundamental picture – is likely looking ahead to turns in the macro yet to come. for months now various indicators have been slipping that way (the yield curve above is exhibit a) but it is when the herds (and their fund managers) take note that these turns will become obvious on main street. in a complicated macro, yield curves are currently steepening. that's a fact.",0
2023-10-28,"back to the farm, senator article:your large villa awaits outside the city... in 1999 it was reported that the world population had reached 6 billion, writes tim price at price value partners. the rate of growth was 1.3% per year. that might not sound dramatic. but at that rate, the world population would double over the next half century. recent changes in birthrates and even more recent demographic developments 'associated' with the global 'overreaction' to covid suggest that population growth will not be the problem that it seemed at the turn of the millennium. and 1.3% is a relatively modest annual growth rate. but if it were to continue, the world population would reach a density of one person per square metre on the dry land surface of the earth in just 780 years. the mass of people on the earth would equal the mass of the earth itself in just 2400 years. in the words of the late dr.albert bartlett, emeritus professor of physics at the university of colorado at boulder, us: ""the greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function."" an exponential function is simply one in which a variable increases at a fixed rate or percentage per time period. this is opposed to an arithmetic function, in which growth is by a fixed amount each period. the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6 illustrates arithmetic growth. the sequence 1,2,4,8,16,32 demonstrates exponential growth.",2
2023-10-28,"as dr.bartlett points out, at some point in the comparatively near future, zero population growth will happen. (the who in association with bill gates may yet have played their part.) but it would be mathematically certain in any case, as a simple response to steady, exponential growth. whatever human beings might want to do, the finite carrying capacity of the earth, and mother nature, will have the final say. let's take another of dr.bartlett's observations. imagine bacteria growing steadily in a bottle. they double in number every minute (the so-called ""doubling time"" in other words is one minute). at 11 am., there is one bacterium in the bottle; at 12 noon the bottle is full. question 1: at what time was the bottle half full? question 2: if you were an average bacterium in the bottle, at what time would you first realize that you were running out of space? question 3: suppose that at 11.58 am, some of the bacteria realize that they are running out of room. so they launch a great search for new bottles. they search offshore, on the outer continental shelf, and in the arctic, and they find three new bottles – a ""colossal new discovery"". how long can the growth continue as a result of the discovery of three new bottles; this quadrupling of the proven resource? answer 1: the bottle was half full at 11.59 am. answer 2: the question, of course, is rhetorical. but as dr.bartlett says, ""think about this.",2
2023-10-28,"this kind of steady growth is the centrepiece of the national economy and of the entire global economy."" at 11.55 am., the bottle is just 1/32 full. with just five minutes left until it fills completely with bacteria, the bottle is 31/32 empty! answer 3: all of the bottles are completely full by 12.02. those extra three bottles bought our bacteria just two extra minutes. that is the power and challenge of the exponential function. we should point out that the exponential function has an ominous relevance to growth – and the limits of growth – in government debt. that shrill, discordant sound you hear is the debt piper; and he really wants to be paid. but let's talk about energy. particularly the political, social and market implications of ""peak oil"" in what are certain to be volatile years ahead. why the references to dr.bartlett? because as us secretary of energy james schlesinger told time magazine in april 1977 (perhaps the last time that americans were truly worried about running out of oil) during the opec price hike-triggered energy crisis of the 1970s: ""we have a classic case of exponential growth against a finite source"". you may be familiar with hubbert's peak. the late dr.m.king hubbert was one of the most celebrated geophysicists who made his reputation on the back of a startling prediction, first made public in 1949, that the era of so-called fossil fuels would be surprisingly short-lived.",2
2023-10-28,"in 1956 he predicted that us oil production would peak in around 1970 and decline thereafter. us oil production did indeed peak in 1970. but as james howard kunstler points out in his book, 'the long emergency', it took a year for the peak to be detected, when lower production figures started to be reported. peak us oil production in 1970 amounted to 11.3 million barrels per day (bpd). that was the high watermark for the us oil industry. production would fall by several per cent per year thereafter. by the mid-1980s, total us crude oil production had fallen below 9 million bpd. it is now running at approximately 6 million bpd. (recent advances in the shale arena have somewhat rebalanced the equation – but then so have the biden administration's asinine energy 'policies'.) this is not just a us problem. hubbert went on to forecast that global oil production would peak between 1990 and 2000. colin campbell, retired chief of research for shell oil, estimated that global peak oil would occur in 2007, and kenneth deffeyes of princeton forecast the global peak at 2005. it may well be that the global oil peak is already behind us. not all of the oil below ground will ever be pumped out. long before an oil field runs completely dry, the oil contained within it becomes so difficult or expensive to pump that it takes more than a barrel of oil's worth of energy to pump out one barrel. even at peak, there will be plenty of oil left in the ground.",2
2023-10-28,"but in kunstler's words it will be ""the half that is deeper down, harder and costlier to extract, sitting under harsh and remote parts of the world, owned in some cases by people with a grudge against [the west], and this remaining oil will be contested by everyone. ""at peak and just beyond, there is massive potential for system failures of all kinds, social, economic and political. peak is quite literally a tipping point. beyond peak, things unravel and the centre does not hold. beyond peak, all bets are off about civilisation's future."" sound eerily relevant to our current cultural and economic predicaments today? (doubly a shame and a scandal beyond words, then, that the us – the world's self-appointed policeman and putative sole superpower – appears frozen into trance-like paralysis under the baleful influence of the biden crime administration, just as its 'end of empire' tribute act gets into full swing.) if 'peak oil' is a real phenomenon, and it is still debated, it is a huge deal. we are not facing the end of fossil fuels, but we are undoubtedly facing the end of cheap fossil fuels. try and identify a single facet of modern life that doesn't have its origins or continued existence courtesy of cheap oil and natural gas. central heating; air conditioning; cars and the fuel that drives them; powered flight; electric lighting; the very fabric of agriculture, and not least fertilizers. and the clothes worn by 'just stop oil' protesters.",2
2023-10-28,"in what james howard kunstler calls 'the long emergency', mankind may face a compelling pressure to revert to a more localised existence. anything more ""global"" might be simply impossible once the next oil shock hits (if we're not already experiencing it). we may have to get used to an altogether more ""local"" economy, one in which year-round strawberries are a thing of the past. same goes for commuting for miles in a gas-guzzling suv. grotesque and illiberal though they are, things like ulez taxes and 15-minute cities seem indicative of the big state's determination to make political capital – and of course to seize private capital – out of a perceived concern over scarcity and the environment. for some years now, we have been writing about the doleful effects of the global financial crisis, and endeavouring to navigate through it. in all that time, energy has been a side issue by comparison with the malign impact of broken banks and bankrupt sovereign finances. but the long financial crisis will ultimately end, as confidence and economic vigour slowly returns, and those banking institutions that survive come to rebuild their shattered balance sheets. there will be pain to be dished out as holders of government bonds belatedly come to realise that those assets are not as riskless as they thought.",2
2023-10-28,"that pain indeed began roughly two years ago as the fundamental insolvency of the west became manifest through surging bond yields after policy and market interest rates reached their lowest – and even at the time clearly unsustainable – levels for 5,000 years. but an energy crisis borne out of a fundamental contraction in new oil supplies, and perhaps savage rises in the price of oil? it is difficult to foresee any element of modern society that wouldn't be dramatically affected. whether from a social or an investment perspective, the natural response to fears about peak oil is to highlight alternative energies, whether in the form of wind, tide, solar, nuclear or hydrogen. there are obviously certain environmental benefits to these alternative fuel technologies, but typical discussion of their implementation ignores one critical fact. apart from being markedly less efficient, no single alternative energy source can remotely begin to replace oil over either the short or medium term – because the installed base of hydrocarbon infrastructure is simply too vast. even if scientists were to suddenly create a magical new energy source that was effectively free to use, it would take decades and trillions of dollars to replace the existing hydrocarbon infrastructure – the network of tens of thousands of petrol stations that support the auto economy, for example.",2
2023-10-28,"for more and excellent analysis of this topic, we recommend the excellent service provided by the doomberg team on substack. and if peak oil is for real, and if we are close to, or beyond, that peak, one thing seems clear: two-digit oil prices may well soon be a thing of the past, too. the immediate investment conclusion would seem to be to pile into the oil majors. but while the oil majors may well outperform the broader stock market – in recent history they've been absolute cash cows – we're not convinced that they'll be the best way to profit from peak oil. why? because they will also be in the unenviable position of having to pay more and more to get every increasingly valuable barrel of oil out of the ground. in other words, while their oil inventory will be worth more in current dollars, their future extraction costs are going inevitably to soar as well, and the balance may not be in favour of stockholders. precious metals and commodities miners have recently suffered from the shareholder perception (which we happen to think not entirely warranted) that higher extraction costs will outweigh higher future commodities prices. oil prices may yet be set for a secular rerating on the back of 'peak oil'. current heightened geopolitical tensions and fresh outright military conflict in the middle east (and asia?) will clearly put a bid under prices. and higher prices will to an extent compensate the oil majors for the heightened costs and risks of exploration and production.",2
2023-10-28,"but oil majors will be obliged to go to ever more remote locations to explore and drill and therefore face more complex geological and geopolitical risks. are people living in denial about the severity of the oil challenge facing the global economy? as a side note, while researching dr.bartlett's book, 'the essential exponential', we happened to stumble upon a review for colin campbell's 2004 book, 'the truth about oil and the looming energy crisis'... ""while on holiday in italy some years back, we visited the remains of the roman villa at desenzano, lake garda, one of the most significant roman villas in the north of the country. we were struck at how the museum's guidebook described its establishment: ""at the end of the roman era, the general economic crisis destroyed the small and medium sized country estates and favoured the formation of a limited number of large villae, an expression of a strong concentration of agrarian property. their proprietors left the city to move onto their land, where...they regained all the authority which they had lost in the deterioration of the political system."" not much has changed with the passing of almost two thousand years. now, as then, the wealthy are retreating to farmland – both geographically and within their investment portfolios – in a general focus on real assets amidst monetary and political uncertainty.",2
2023-10-28,"whether or not we believe in the peak oil thesis, the harsh reality would seem to be that global population growth and trends in energy consumption are imposing an increasingly untenable burden on our installed but secularly underdeveloped and underinvested energy infrastructure. so we must all now pay the price for that colossal political policy failure – both literally, and figuratively.",2

2023-10-27,"and that is why – we hazard – business investment has slackened. but to proceed... let us recall the gdp equation: consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports. we now train our sights on the government spending ""contribution"" to the gross domestic product. we are told total government spending contributed 0.8 percentage points to third-quarter gdp. affirms marketwatch: ""government spending, meanwhile, rose sharply again, largely because of an increase in defense-related purchases. the us has sent lots of arms to ukraine and has to replenish its own dwindling military supplies."" we can merely surmise that any economic reversal should be met by vast increases to the expenditure on tanks, warplanes and warships. the economy would be up and away in very short order. but we let it pass. a question nonetheless arises: how can government spending add even the lonest cent to the gross domestic product? we must first recall that government lacks all resources. imagine a parasite with its fangs sunk into a host. you have just imagined a government. this parasite may serve certain useful functions, we may concede if we are in generous humor. the host/parasite relationship nonetheless obtains. before government can ladle out one meager dollar for guns, for butter, for bread, for circuses...it must first pluck it from private pockets – directly or indirectly. that is, through taxes or credit. that is, through taxes or taxes.",1
2023-10-27,"as we have explained before: the dollar borrowed appears a lesser plucking than the dollar taxed. but it is an equal plucking. it is merely a plucking at one remove. do not forget, the borrowed dollar must be repaid – with interest into the bargain. and who pays it? the answer, at all times and in all places, is the taxpayer. government at all levels is credited with a thumping 36% of united states gdp spending. yet we are fond to cite this example: assume the government pays a fellow to shovel a hole. assume further this government pays him to empty the dirt back in. in the official telling you have just witnessed an increase to the gross domestic product. yet have you? or have you merely witnessed a sort of leg-pulling, a statistical feint – a squandering of time, effort and resources? we believe you have your answer. furthermore: automobile production, computer production, food production, widget production, all enhance the consumer's material existence. does tank production? does warplane production? does warship production? we are riddled with doubt. they may be necessary. they are very likely necessary. yet let us see them in their true aspect – as expenditures – not consumer ""goods"". they do not enhance the consumer's economic health. thus we conclude our reflections on today's ""sizzling"" economic report. into our hellbox it goes. and hopefully into yours.",1

""[so] the mildly bullish forecast from delegates is indicative of a lack of conviction"" in the face of higher-for-longer interest rates, even ""while physical [consumer] regions and central banks continue to be super supportive."" contrarian klaxon? reviewing the history of lbma conference forecasts, maybe the past 12 months' gains in gold just weren't big enough. because, if you map prior conference predictions against what just happened to prices... ...rather than trying to see if those forecasts hold any predictive value... ...then the chart makes much more sense. especially if you allow for the fact that, for many lbma conference attendees, the price they charge – whether for coins, small bars or jewelry – comes a little or more above spot prices anyway. gold quality at root, the lbma exists to set and maintain the good delivery standards for the fineness, shape and size of bullion bars acceptable to the london market, heart of precious metals trading and storage worldwide. that way, lbma members – and their customers – trade only the very best metal, good every time it's delivered and without needing an assayer to check and re-check quality each time the gold is moved from one specialist vault to another.",0
2023-10-26,"but on top of the physical requirements, further rules keep accruing to the good delivery standards, adding – most dramatically – ever more esg requirements over the last decade and more. that acronym – environmental, social and governance – covers pretty much everything you might hope to achieve (or be accused of failing to do) over and above turning a profit. but esg increasingly matters to that profit as well. because as 4-decade market veteran mehdi barkhordar said in the 'future of gold' panel on day 2 of lbma 2023, ""esg equals r, and r stands for reputation."" hence the hot topic (again) of trying to get more gold from artisanal and small-scale mining into london good delivery gold bars. start by adding asm and lgd to your alphabet soup. because the volume of gold unearthed by some of the world's very poorest people which finds its way into lgd bullion has collapsed, sinking to barely 1% of the formal market's new annual supply. why? esg of course!",0
2023-10-26,"plus all the resulting reputational threats which stepping outside the large-scale stock-market-listed mining sector risks bringing down on your head thanks to ever-tighter rules on conflict-free supply chains, ever-tighter anti-money laundering rules across the financial and commercial sectors, and all the due diligence checks now added since the first responsible & sustainable sourcing rules came into force in 2012. (yes, add rss to your acronyms too.) now, that figure for lgd gold coming from asm has risen to perhaps 2% over the last 12 months. so the lbma's initiative – working together with the mining industry's world gold council – appears to be helping. but that 2% figure still contrasts badly with estimates of 15-20% for the total volume of all the world's newly-mined gold which comes from asm's informal, sometimes illegal and often dangerous production... ...and it leaves perhaps 20 if not 40 million people worldwide digging gold out of the ground but locked out of earning the higher prices which the lgd supply chain pays versus the cut-price bid from gangsters and crooks. what to do? lots of people have lots of ideas. and demands. ""the lbma's asm project applies risk-based due diligence, rather than assuming guilt,"" noted gregory mthembu-salter, director of south africa-based phuzumoya consulting, chairing the responsible sourcing session last week and raising hopes that 'perfect' won't keep being the enemy of the 'good'.",0
2023-10-26,"but some ngos (there's another acronym; non-governmental organizations) are pushing back on that approach, while others demand that refiners on the london good delivery list not only take metal from asm miners but also spend additional money to improve their lives and local society, too. together, that risks cementing the ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" problem that's forced some major refiners to quit buying metal from entire continents rather than spend time and money just to put their reputation on the line. governments also keep making demands of the legal gold industry too... ...rightly pushing against conflict, terrorist and organized crime-funding gold but also raising the risks – over and above reputation – into the courts (if not jail) for anyone daring to try expanding the formal industry's feedstock by engaging with and paying asm miners. why would the refiners and banks bother? business is humming along anyway, right? gold liquid forget the cerveza in barcelona (if you can recall it to start with). liquidity in any market, as the lbma barcelona conference was reminded in both this year's very strong 'investment exposure' session and by the 'future of gold' panel, means the ability to sell as easily as you buy without suffering a deep price discount as you get your order matched.",0
2023-10-26,"and for gold – suddenly – retail dealers across the west are finding that their customers want to sell the stuff back to them at today's all-time or near-record highs. ""this is the most dramatic change in consumer gold demand i can remember in any major market,"" said 37-year precious metals veteran wolfgang wrzesniok-rossbach, founder and ceo of consultancy fragold gmbh, of the german bullion coin and bar market. how dramatic? germany's retail gold bar and coin demand is down 78% this year versus 2022. net silver demand has sunk by 90%. sure, this plunges comes off a very high base. perhaps it's just a return to normal as german and other european citizens finally get to earn a positive rate of interest on their cash savings again (well, positive until you account for inflation) rather than paying a negative rate as they faced from 2014 to 2022. but the plunge is proving a real shock to some newer german gold and silver retailers, and the sudden lack of new buyers across western economies – plus the move to take profit among existing private investors, as well as among etf shareholders and (for instance) bullionvault users – means metal is piling up. so again, last week's opportunity to take stock of the precious metals market in late 2023 gave many attendees a quick break from counting stock back in their office, shop or warehouse.",0

2023-10-23,"he was one of the most decorated officers in us naval history, with 26 personal combat decorations, including four silver stars. jim collins, author of the influential study of us businesses, 'good to great', interviewed stockdale during his research for the book. how had he found the courage to survive those long, dark years? ""i never lost faith in the end of the story,"" replied stockdale. ""i never doubted not only that i would get out, but also that i would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining moment of my life, which in retrospect, i would not trade."" collins was silent for a few minutes. the two men walked along, stockdale with a heavy limp, swinging a stiff leg that had never properly recovered from repeated torture. finally, collins went on to ask another question. who didn't make it out? ""oh, that's easy,"" replied stockdale. ""the optimists."" collins was confused. ""the optimists. oh, they were the ones who said, 'we're going to be out by christmas.' and christmas would come, and christmas would go. then they'd say, 'we're going to be out by easter.' and easter would come, and easter would go. and then thanksgiving. and then it would be christmas again. and they died of a broken heart."" as the two men walked slowly onward, stockdale turned to collins.

2023-10-23,"as regards stock markets, price is what you pay, and value (or lack thereof) is what you get. on any fair analysis, the us market in particular is a fly in search of a windscreen. using professor robert shiller's cyclically adjusted price / earnings ratio for the broad us stock market (currently 29.8x), shown below, us stocks have only been more expensive than they are today a handful of times in the past 130 years: in 2000, when they briefly traded at 44x, and more recently, just before the scamdemic. we are now ""merely"" back to 1929 pre-crash levels, at around 30x. the peak-to-trough fall for the dow jones industrial average from 1929, for example (when the market hit a shiller p/e of only 30x), equated to 89%. the peak-to-trough fall for the dow from 2000 equated to ""just"" 38%. time will tell just how disappointing (both by scale and by duration) the coming years will be for us equity market and growth stock bulls. vice admiral stockdale was unequivocal: while we need to confront the ""brutal facts"" of the marketplace, we also need to keep faith that we will prevail. to us, that boils down to avoiding conspicuous overvaluation (in most bond markets, for example, and a significant portion of the developed equity markets) and embracing equally conspicuous value – where current poor sentiment is likely to intensify subsequent upside returns.",2

""they struggle to generate enough profits to cover their debt obligations, yet manage to stay afloat thanks to lenient borrowing conditions. the prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis played a significant role in sustaining these firms, allowing them to refinance their debts at favorable terms. ""as a result, many of these entities have been able to continue operating, albeit with weakened balance sheets and limited growth prospects."" these zombies exist in a sort of twilit torpor between life and death. their condition resembles a coma – yet it is not precisely a coma. it is more a guttering along...in a reduced, scarcely comatose existence. yet they refuse to die the death. they can scare up sufficient credit to keep the grim reaper and the devil at arm's distance. thus they are zombies...neither alive nor dead...both alive and dead. they acquired their bizarre existence during the era of zero interest rates and infinite credit. cheap, nearly cost-free credit sustained them. they got while the getting was good. yet the getting is no longer good. interest rates have soared high above zero.",1
2023-10-19,"and the cheap credit that sustained them is no longer cheap. burrows: ""one of the key factors enabling zombie firms to survive has been the availability of cheap credit. as central banks increase interest rates in response to improving economic conditions and/or inflation, the environment that has sustained these firms has shifted dramatically. higher interest rates will lead to increased borrowing costs for these entities, potentially pushing some of them over the brink and into insolvency."" now these zombies are on the move, destination main street: ""the persistence of zombie firms has implications beyond individual company struggles. these entities tie up resources that could otherwise be invested in more productive and innovative ventures. resources such as labor, capital and market share are effectively locked within these stagnant firms, inhibiting the overall efficiency of the economy. this phenomenon can contribute to sluggish economic growth, reduced job creation and a less dynamic business landscape."" bloomberg has identified some 600 such creatures – or 20% of the united states' largest publicly traded entities. their very existence represents a larceny of the present and a larceny of the future. they are devouring resources that might otherwise serve productive purpose. imagine for the moment that you inhabit a sane and parallel universe. imagine that the federal reserve let economic and financial systems run their natural course following the 2008 nastiness.",1
2023-10-19,"interest rates would have likely gone soaring. many firms loaded to the gunwales with debt would have filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of united states code. the grief – though acute – would have likely proven brief. sound business with deep roots within the soil would have endured. higher interest rates would have encouraged savings...and gradually re-amassed the capital stock. from this capital stock the green shoots of future growth would have come thrusting. yet it was not to be. rather than letting the cleansing fire clear away the deadwood...the federal reserve intervened to preserve it. this it did for years under zero or near-zero interest rate policy. yet artificially low interest rates rob the future to gratify the present. they deprive the struggling saplings of their nourishment – nourishment that promises tomorrow's growth. how many future redwoods never came into being because these zombies robbed their nutrients? the answer is many. thus the federal reserve shattered the six mandates of sound central banking. these are, as summarized by wikipedia: protect the money stock instead of saving individual institutions; rescue solvent institutions only; let insolvent institutions default; charge penalty rates; require good collateral; and announce the conditions before a crisis so that the market knows exactly what to expect. a word of explanation – perhaps – on ""penalty rates""... the central bank should charge interest rates above the market rate.",1

2023-10-11,"according to the heritage foundation's daniel kochis, moscow has employed and continues to employ the weaponization of migrants to manipulate the situation in places like syria, north africa and the sahel, effectively pushing refugees toward european shores. russia isn't the only country to have used this strategy. according to judge aaron petty, an appellate immigration judge at the board of immigration appeals, belarusian leader alexander lukashenko orchestrated a crisis in 2021 by enticing thousands of migrants and asylum seekers – primarily from iraq, syria and afghanistan – to belarus and then pushing them toward the european union (eu) border, exploiting eu legislation and un treaties for asylum seekers. judge petty believes the weaponization of migrants will increase, particularly by states like china and russia. such ""gray zone"" activities, including the manipulation of population flows, are aimed at shaping the strategic environment, destabilizing rivals and achieving objectives through means just short of direct warfare. manufacturing an influx of migrants, or even just threatening to do so, has proven effective in the past in leveling the playing field with more powerful adversaries. it has created a bargaining chip and forces the engagement of targeted countries. unless policymakers address the underlying dynamics that enable weaponized migration, the use of this tactic is likely to persist and expand, judge petty says.",0
2023-10-11,"that's precisely what european policymakers are seeking to do. this month, eu diplomats reached a consensus on immigration policy reforms, following the resolution of a dispute between italy and germany over non-governmental organizations (ngos) operating in the mediterranean. the aim of these reforms is to enable eu states to respond in a unified manner to significant increases in asylum-seekers. a pivotal element of the agreement proposes the redistribution of migrants from countries with high influxes, like italy and greece, to other eu nations. countries that opt out of hosting asylum-seekers would be obligated to financially compensate those that do. for investors, this is a sign that europe is keenly aware of the risks and is looking to mitigate them. a stable europe means a more predictable investment environment, especially in industries like tourism, real estate and manufacturing. the bigger question remains: will the us follow suit? the ongoing challenges at the us-mexico border, combined with weaponized migration's growing prominence as a tool, mean that us policy decisions in the coming months will be crucial. for investors, this means staying informed, agile and ready to adapt. government policy is a precursor to change, after all, and it's important to be prepared for sudden policy shifts. it's also wise to diversify investments across sectors and regions, hedging against potential disruptions such as weaponized migration.",0
