2025-06-22,"for the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year. the hyperscale customers like microsoft are buying nvidia's gpus as fast as it can produce them. in fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year. however, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including microsoft. if those customers pull back on ai spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth. it faces plenty of challenges from other gpu makers and custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. several of them are working to build chips for both training and inference that offer better price performance than nvidia's all-in-one solution. so, while the gpu maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. the stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. that's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in ai, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations. story continues is microsoft steadily marching toward $4 trillion? microsoft has seen strong results for its azure cloud computing platform over the last few years, thanks, in part, to its partnership with openai.",2

2025-06-22,"reverse splits, which increase a company's share price, are normally shunned by investors. reverse splits are often enacted by struggling companies that are attempting to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange. in comparison, investors typically love public companies that complete forward splits, which are designed to lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who can't buy fractional shares through their brokers. the businesses undertaking forward splits usually have rich histories of recurring profitability. while three brand-name businesses have taken the plunge and become the latest stock-split stocks this year, the split announcement that all of wall street is waiting for is officially back on the table. non-tech companies are making their shares more accessible to everyday investors in 2025 last year, more than a dozen high-profile companies announced a split, and a number of these companies were high-growth ai stocks, including nvidia, broadcom, super micro computer, and palo alto networks. the ""class of 2025"" stock-split stocks all come from outside the tech sector. wholesale industrial and construction supplies company fastenal (nasdaq: fast) was the first to cross the proverbial finish line by completing a 2-for-1 forward split after the close of trading on may 21.",1
