2025-06-13 14:10:00-05:30,"earnings evolution microsoft, meta, and nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. all three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries. microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the no. 2 cloud computing player behind amazon web services (aws). it has also leveraged artificial intelligence (ai) across its operations to boost efficiency and grow profit margins. instagram became such a prevalent social media app that facebook changed its name to meta platforms to showcase the company's family of apps and virtual and augmented reality investments. instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. instagram has helped meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like tiktok. it wasn't long ago that nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, pcs, visualization, and software for internet applications. but now, the company's compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company's main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations.",0
2025-06-13 14:10:00-05:30,"story continues in nvidia's latest quarter, which was the three months ended april 27, compute and networking brought in $39.6 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in operating income, compared to $4.5 billion in revenue for graphics and $1.6 billion in operating income. for context, nvidia's compute and networking for the same quarter just one year ago was $22.7 billion and $17.1 billion in operating income -- illustrating the segment's breakneck growth rate.in sum, microsoft, meta platforms, and nvidia have undergone considerable transformations in recent years. newer business segments are arguably the most valuable part of each company -- cloud for microsoft, instagram for meta, and sales for data centers for nvidia.fair prices for exceptional businesseswhen a company evolves, it can take the market time to properly value the new business. microsoft, meta, and nvidia crushed the s&p 500 (snpindex: ^gspc) over the last five to 10 years, especially meta and nvidia. and yet, because all three companies are growing profits from their legacy business segments and new markets, their valuations are still reasonable.microsoft and meta both have slightly higher price-to-earnings (p/e) ratios than their five-year median levels. nvidia's p/e ratio is down considerably since the company wasn't as profitable a few years ago. data by ycharts.",0

the first options-based income etf tied to gamestop corp.
